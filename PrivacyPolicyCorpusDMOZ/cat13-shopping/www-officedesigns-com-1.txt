Disclaimer of Warranties
Office Designs intends for the information
and data contained in the Site to be accurate and reliable but such information
and data are provided 'AS IS' and "AS AVAILABLE". You expressly agree
that your use of the Site and any information contained therein is at your sole
risk. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, OFFICE DESIGNS EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE
OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the disclaimer of warranties so such disclaimers may not apply to you.
Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL OFFICE DESIGNS OR ITS
OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES,
DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THIS SITE OR
VIA OTHER METHODS , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO
ANY USER OF THE SITE OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE)
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR ANY INFORMATION
CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF OFFICE DESIGNS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You acknowledge that the preceding
limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services
available through the Site. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by
law.
Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if
Office Designs is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third
party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed
the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) month period prior to
the action or omission giving rise to the liability or (b) $100.
Legal Disputes
YOU AND OFFICE DESIGNS AGREE TO GIVE UP
ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN
A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY
BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Any dispute between you and Office
Designs, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors,
assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section,
"Office Designs") arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and
their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the
relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about
the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision
(collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding
arbitration in Lake County, Illinois administered by the American Arbitration
Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in effect on the date
thereof. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give
the other party at least 60-days' prior written notice of its intent to file
for arbitration. Office Designs will provide such notice by e-mail to your
e-mail address on file with Office Designs and you must provide such notice by
e-mail to legal@Office Designs.com.
During such 60-day period, the parties
will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes.
Failing such settlement and expiration of the 60-day period, either party may
initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever
relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the
arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered
as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not,
however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to
which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator will apply applicable law (which
is Illinois law) and the provisions of these Terms of Use and the failure to do
so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial
review and reversal. Office Designs and you agree that any Covered Dispute
hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither
Office Designs nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a
class, representative or private attorney action. The arbitrator will have no
authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general
basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found to
be unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining
arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class,
representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any
statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to
these Terms of Use must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or
be forever barred. For purposes of this section, these Terms of Use and related
transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
Termination
Your ability to access and use the Site
remains in effect unless and until terminated in accordance with these Terms of
Use. You agree that Office Designs, in its sole discretion, with or without
prior notice, may terminate your account and/or your use of the Site and/or may
remove and delete your User Content if Office Designs believes that you have
violated or acted inconsistently with these Terms of Use or for any other
reason. Office Designs also may in its sole discretion and at any time
discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, or may modify the Site, with
or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Site
may be effected without prior notice and you acknowledge and agree that Office
Designs may bar any further access to the Site. Further, you agree that Office
Designs will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of
access to the Site.

a letter stating your intention to Office Designs LLC, 722 Landwehr Road,

The provisions of the Intellectual
Property Rights, User-Generated Content, Acceptable Use Policy, Disclaimer of
Warranties, Indemnity, Limitation of Liability, Legal Dispute sections,
together with and any other rights and obligations which by their nature are
reasonably intended to survive such termination, will survive any termination
of these Terms of Use.

only sells product to addresses in the United States of America. Office
Designs makes no representations or warranties that the Site or any materials
contained therein are valid, appropriate or available for use outside of the

and/or the provision of any service, program or other product described thereon
to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion.
General Information
No waiver of any provision or any breach
of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provisions or any other
or further breach. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to
be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be severed, and the remainder
of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect. These Terms of Use set
forth the entire Agreement between you and Office Designs with respect to use
of the Site and supersede any prior agreements between you and Office Designs
relating to such subject matter. The Terms of Use are not assignable,
transferable or sublicensable by you except with Office Designs' prior written
consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be
deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. No
agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee
relationship is intended or created by these Terms of Use. Any heading, caption
or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience
and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. Office
Designs' performance of these Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and
legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use is in derogation of
Office Designs' right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement
requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information
provided to or gathered by Office Designs with respect to such use. A printed
version of these Terms of Use and of any notices given in electronic form will
be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
printed form. All correspondence relating to these Terms of Use must be written
in the English language.

Terms of Use to us.

provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us.
Information We Collect
We collect certain information that you
share with us, including:
Personally Identifiable Information:
"Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" is
information that can personally identify you, such as your name, email
address and telephone number. We may retain your Personally Identifiable
Information as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Service. What
specific Personally Identifiable Information we collect depends on how you
use the Service. Providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us
is your choice. Be aware, however, that if you choose not to provide us
with certain Personally Identifiable Information, you may not be able to
take advantage of certain features of the Service.

visit the Service, we may collect various categories of general non-Personally
Identifiable Information ("General Information"). General

Online Identification Tools
We may use your IP address to help identify
and solve issues with our server and provide you with a better web browsing experience.
We may use your IP address to identify you, your shopping cart and wish list
and to collect General Information.
We use cookies to keep track of your items
in your cart and wish list and for other purposes such as personalizing the
Service. A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your
computer. By default, your web browser is set up to accept cookies. If you change
the settings to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your
account, cart, wish list or to personalize the content that you see.
Do Not Track Signals
Some web browsers incorporate a "Do
Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to a website that
a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website
that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser
can block that website from collecting certain information. Not all browsers
offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. Thus, the Site may not
recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Third Party Features
The Service also may include social media
buttons and widgets, such as the Facebook or Twitter "Like" button. Clicking
on these buttons will take you to third party website. These third party
websites may collect and display your Personally Identifiable Information, your
IP address and the page you are visiting on the Service and may set a cookie to
enable the feature to function properly. These features may be hosted by a
third party and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy
of the third party that provides the feature.
Third-Party Links
We may provide links to third-party websites
that we do not own or control, for example, to social media websites and websites
operated by manufacturers of products we sell. We are not responsible for the
information collection practices of any website that we do not own or control. The
privacy practices of third-party websites are solely their responsibility.

as part of a merger or acquisition.
We may use your General Information and Personally
Identifiable Information that has been stripped of personally identifiable

liability in connection with User Content.

or address of the page. Secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with
"https://" instead of "http://".

of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that your use
of the Site and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we

Designs' Copyright Policy
This Copyright Policy describes Office Designs'
policy of prohibiting any information or materials that violate another party's
intellectual property rights from appearing on the Site.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for a copyright owner who
believes that material appearing on the Internet infringes his, her or its
rights under U.S. copyright law. Office Designs complies with the DMCA by
responding to notices and counter-notices that meet the then-current DMCA
requirements. Current DMCA requirements may be found at
http://www.copyright.gov/.
Notification of Alleged Copyright
Infringement
If you have a good faith belief that
material appearing on the Site infringes your copyright, you (or your agent)
may send Office Designs a written notification pursuant to the DMCA (a "DMCA
Notice"). Your DMCA Notice should be sent to our Copyright Agent
(identified below), contain all of the information listed below (and as further
set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and request that the material be removed or
that access to it be blocked. Your DMCA Notice must contain:
1. Identification in sufficient detail of
the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted
works on the Site are covered by a single notification, you may provide a
representative list of such works on the Site; however, the representative list
must contain sufficient detail for each of the copyrighted works so that we can
identify them;
2. Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Site that
contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must
provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the
alleged infringing material and comply with your request to remove or deny
access to the material;
3. Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);
4. The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a
person authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf;
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material on
the Site as you have described in the DMCA Notice is not authorized by the
copyright owner or its agent or the law; and
6. A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information
contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner
or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
that is allegedly infringed.
You must submit any notification of an
alleged copyright infringement to Office Designs' Copyright Agent by mail or
email as set forth below:
Office Designs Copyright Agent
Attn: Legal
722 Landwehr Road
Northbrook, IL 60062
Email: customercare@officedesigns.com (Re: "Office
Designs DMCA Notice")
If you fail to comply with all of the
above requirements, your DMCA Notice will not be valid. Please note that you
may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys' fees, if you
materially misrepresent that materials on the Site are infringing a copyright.
Counter Notification
If you believe in good faith that your own
copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of mistake or
misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification letter to Office
Designs' Copyright Agent pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To
be an effective counter notification under the DMCA, your written
correspondence must include substantially the following:
1. Identification of the material that has
been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before
it was removed or disabled;
2. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district
court in which your address is located or the federal district court for Northbrook,
Illinois if your address is outside the United States;
3. A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that
filed the notification of alleged copyright infringement or the party's agent;
4. Your name, address and telephone number;
5. A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that you have a good
faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result
of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled, or
that the material identified by the complaining party has been removed or
disabled at the URL or web location and will no longer be shown or accessible;
and
6. Your physical or electronic signature.
You may submit your counter notification
to Office Designs' Copyright Agent by mail or email as set forth below:
Office Designs Copyright Agent
Attn: Legal Department
722 Landwehr Road
Northbrook, IL 60062
Email: customercare@officedesigns.com (please reference
"Office Designs DMCA Notice")
Upon receipt of a counter notice, Office Designs'
Copyright Agent may send a copy of it to the original complaining party
informing that party that Office Designs may replace the removed content or
cease disabling it. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against Office Designs, the removed content may be replaced or access to
it restored by Office Designs.
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply
with all of the above requirements, your DMCA counter notification will not be
valid. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or
removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable
for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.
