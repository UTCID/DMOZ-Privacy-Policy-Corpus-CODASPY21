• to improve the content, appearance and utility of the Sites;
• to track our visitors’ use of the Sites for internal market research; and
• to notify our visitors of updates to the Sites.
It is Ktena’s policy to keep Personal Information only for so long as needed for such purposes. At any time, you may obtain a summary of the Personal Information on record with Ktena which has been collected about you via this Site. Except for Personal Information we need to complete your purchase of products, you may request at any time that Ktena dispose of any or all Personal Information about you. In addition, at any time you may request: (i) that Ktena correct any such Personal Information; or (ii) [that such Personal Information not be provided to third parties; or (iii)] that such Personal Information be removed from Ktena’s marketing databases. To make any request described above, send an e-mail to admins@ktena.com.au.
