We aim to keep the site update at all times; however, information appearing at a particular time may not always reflect the position exactly at the moment you place the order.

Every care is taken to ensure that the description and specifications of our jewellery is correct.

Please contact our Customer Service Representatives if you are unhappy with any of the items you receive and they will advise you accordingly.

If your order is for a personalised item, please allow an additional 3 working days for the despatch of your order.

Returns Policy
Here at Silver by Mail providing the best quality products and service is extremely important to us. If you are not completely satisfied with your order, please return the goods to us. We require that these items are returned unused and in the original packaging, within 28 days from the day of dispatch. Should this be upheld, we will happily provide a refund or, alternatively, exchange the item.
Silver by Mail will accept full responsibility for a broken item that is deemed a manufacturing fault and will happily refund, replace or exchange accordingly. However, we cannot be held responsible for items that have been accidentally broken. All damaged returns will be subject to an inspection by the Returns Department before a suggested course of action can be discussed.
Jewellery, by its very nature, is delicate and as such may need repairing from time to time; with this in mind we offer a high quality, value for money repair service. If the item cannot be repaired we will offer a replacement at a discounted purchase price.
Regrettably, delivery charges for the original order will not be refunded. Any items returned that arrive damaged or become lost, will not be credited. Goods received damaged in transit will be replaced at no cost with free delivery, provided you inform us of any breakage within three days of receiving the order.
Refunds will be processed according to the method of payment originally used for your order. Should this be unacceptable, please contact us to discuss this matter with a Customer Service Representative.
Returns for refund received after 28 working days will be offered a Customer Credit for use on their next order. Please contact our Customer Service Representatives should you be delayed in returning your parcel.
Products that have been personalised in any way are non-returnable. This includes the personalised jewellery collection and rings that have been resized.
For information on how to return items to us, please see our Returns Page.
International Returns:
Unfortunately, any parcels returned from an international address will be at your own cost. We also recommend a free receipt of postage be obtained when returning orders from overseas as we will not accept responsibility for parcels lost in transit.
For the overseas returns address, please contact our Customer Service Representatives via email (contactus@silver.uk .com) or telephone on 0345 307 3297.

“Strikethrough” prices are displayed in accordance with a clearance, sale or promotional item. If an item is added to your basket whilst this sale is still live but you do not checkout, your basket will revert back to the original price of the product, before the sale.
Gift Vouchers
Gift vouchers may only be purchased and redeemed via the Silver by Mail site.

Promotional discount codes offered by Silver by Mail are only valid until the date specified and delivery charges will still apply.
If you return an item to us for a refund, having ordered with a money-off promotional code and your total order now equates to lower than the threshold for the original offer, you will no longer qualify for the monetary discount. We will therefore refund you the original price of the item, less the value of the code used.

“Percentage Discount” promotional codes cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or code and can only be applied according to the specifications outlined on the marketing email and/or catalogue received.

“Free Gift” promotional codes cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or code and can only be applied according to the specifications outlined on the marketing email and/or catalogue received. Promotional codes offered by Silver by Mail are only valid until the date specified and delivery charges will still apply.
If you return an item to us for a refund, having ordered with a promotional code for free gift provided you spend over a certain amount, and your total order now equates to lower than the threshold for the original offer, you will no longer qualify for this promotion. We therefore request that you return the gift to us with your return, or be willing to pay for the gift at the retail price. Alternatively, we can process an exchange for the returned item so that the monetary value of the order remains higher than the threshold for the original offer.
