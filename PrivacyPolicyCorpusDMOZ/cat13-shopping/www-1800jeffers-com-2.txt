PRODUCT INFORMATION
Prices
The products are available while supplies last. The prices displayed on the Site, however, are quoted in U.S. Dollars and are valid and effective only in the United States. Prices are subject to change without notice. Jeffers may also change, delete, move, or add product without notice on the site. Product Use
Jeffers disclaims any responsibility for the use or misuse of products and of the methods of use described on this site. The manufacturer's label should always be followed. No Jeffers employee is authorized to recommend any deviation from label usage.
Vaccines
All vaccines are non-returnable and non-refundable. Because vaccines must be kept at cool temperatures to ensure potency, Jeffers strongly recommends overnight or two-day shipping. When placed in a padded envelope with ice, vaccines can be safely shipped to you even during the summer months. Vaccines are shipped early in the week to prevent them from being in transit over the weekend. When you receive your order, the ice packs will be melted but they will have already done their job protecting your biologicals. Be sure to keep your vaccines refrigerated until you are ready to use them. Never freeze a vaccine or biological.
View Vaccine Shipping Schedule
An extra-insulated cooler is also available for vaccines.
Before you order, make sure the shipping methods and quantities of vaccines you select are correct and are afforded the level of protection they will require. All biologicals instruct that you use the entire contents when first opened.
NOTE: All of our handling controls are based upon advice from the manufacturer, professional consultation and rigorous internally tested control procedures.
Rabies Shots
Please note that because it is unlawful in many states to purchase Rabies Shots from any source other than a licensed veterinarian, Jeffers is only able to ship Rabies Shots to those states in which it is legal. If you live in a state where it is unlawful to ship Rabies Shots, Jeffers will note this when you enter your shipping address and will remove that item from your shopping cart and present you with a new total based on the other items in your cart.
COLORS
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of  products that appear on the Site. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your computer monitor, your  monitor's display may be different than the actual color. If you are not satisfied with the color of your product as it was represented online, Jeffers will gladly exchange that product.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES
To the extent that this Site contains links to outside services and resources, the availability and content of which Jeffers does not control, any concerns regarding any such service or resource, or any link thereto, should be directed to the particular outside service or resource.
DISCLAIMER

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL NECESSARY SERVICING OR REPAIRS OF ANY EQUIPMENT YOU USE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SITE, AND THAT JEFFERS, INC. SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.
