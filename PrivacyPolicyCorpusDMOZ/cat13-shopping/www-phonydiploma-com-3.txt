Terms and Conditions
By visiting or shopping at our store, you accept the following site terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.

Our novelty diploma, transcripts and certificates are not "exact" matches of original documents.  While our replicas are based on the original school design and have similar fonts, wording, layouts and emblem placement, we have both legal and technical restrictions on how closely we match.  For instance, we don't type original administrator's names or forge their signatures.  Additionally, because many emblems, seals and logos are held under copyright by the original organization, our emblems are of our own creation with differences that may be noticeable in both design and application technique.

CANCELLATIONS - Before Product is Shipped
What are Fake Diplomas or why would these be classified as such?
Only 100% authentic diplomas are issued by the school directly. Since our company and many others offer documents as alternatives to school issued documents, they can be considered fake because we are not the school or affiliated with the school. The are classified as novelty and can only be used as such, or repacement for what you have on file with the school. Please understand this difference when you order. What we print is what should be on file with the school.
