How Does COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Affect Our Shop?
FAQ Concerning Covid-19 And Flower Deliveries:
Starting, 5/20/20, our stores will be open for walk-in customers.
We are limited to 5 customers per store and will ask that you maintain distance.
We will continue to support our customers with Contactless delivery and curbside pickup for those that do not feel comfortable coming into the store. Same day orders can be placed online at www.oberers.com or at 800-783-4747.
Thank you for your understand and patience.
Flowers are still the best way to help share a little light in the world. There's no better way to show love than with some colorful, fragrant flowers that remind us that spring is coming, and better days are ahead!
Has Coronavirus Affected Our Flower Delivery Procedures?
Our deliveries will proceed as normal, but we will be taking extra precautions in order to help prevent the spread of the virus. At the shop, we believe we are needed now more than ever to spread love and happiness to our communities!
Can I Still Have Flowers Delivered To The Hospital?
The short answer is, it depends. Please call the shop for all hospital deliveries, to find out about the latest delivery restrictions. Hospitals have begun limiting visitors and deliveries so these circumstances may change, but we are currently delivering to all hospitals that are still accepting deliveries. However, some current regulations do not allow for floral deliveries to be made directly to a patient's room, so all deliveries will be left with the volunteer desk.
Can I Still Have Flowers Delivered To A Funeral Visitation Or Service?
Many visitations and services have been canceled or postponed due to Covid-19. Please make sure you have all the details of the service restrictions before placing an order. Include as much information as possible when placing an order over the phone or online, and if you find that the details of an order you've already placed have changed, please be sure to notify us as quickly as possible so we can make the necessary adjustments.
