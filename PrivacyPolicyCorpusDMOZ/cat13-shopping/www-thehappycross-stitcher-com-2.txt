DATA RETENTION
When you place an order through the Site, one paper copy of every order placed is kept for approximately 6 years for accounting purposes, as per the HMRC requirements and then destroyed securely, we use a secure, professional shredding service. Electronic order details are kept for approximately 6 months before deletion.
Paperwork within the current six year period is stored in dated boxes in a hidden storage area within my home, which is alarmed. The alarm is checked and serviced on an annual basis. Paperwork from the current year is stored in my home office which also has a lockable door and is transferred to the storage area when the box is full. Paperwork kept consists of the customer’s name, address, telephone number, email address and items ordered only, no payment details are stored.
Due to the nature, complexity and length of time it takes to stitch Photo to Chart conversions, a copy of your chart will be kept on file for approximately two years before being deleted.
Customer accounts are checked regularly and any that have not been used for approximately six months are deleted. Should you wish to have your account details deleted at any time, please call 01325 240192 or email using the contact page.
Customers can re-register at any time.
All orders are posted using Royal Mail or a courier if necessary. All orders are processed by myself, I have no employees.
