Decree no. June 30, 2003, n. 196, containing the Code
regarding the Protection of Personal Data, as amended
by Regulation (EU) no. 679 of 27 April 2016 - applicable
from 25 May 2018 (hereafter referred to as "Applicable
Privacy Law"), also known as GDPR (General Data Protection
Regulation).

access and navigation on his Site, as well as the use
of the Services.
Any further processing takes place only on the basis
of obligations established by law, or with the explicit
consent given by the User to the Owner.
In particular, the personal data of Users will be collected
and processed for the following purposes:
a) respond to Users' requests;

of the Site and the Services, as well as the administration
and management of requests and orders of Users;
c) to prevent fraud or crimes committed through the Site
or the Services;

Owner will process the personal data of Users based on
their requests and their legitimate interest.

the Owner will process the personal data of Users on the
basis of their consent.
4. Data retention times

will be kept for the time strictly necessary to achieve
the purposes for which they were originally collected
and, in any case, will no longer be processed as a result
of any revocation of consent given.
Where the processing of personal data should instead
take place in fulfillment of legal, fiscal or judicial
obligations, the data may be stored up to a maximum of
ten (10) years.
5. Regarding processing
All personal data will be processed mainly through electronic
means and methods, however it is possible to process it
on paper too.
The Data Controller will take all necessary security
measures in order to minimize the risk of destruction
or loss, even accidental, of the data, unauthorized access
or processing that is not permitted or does not comply
with the purposes indicated in this document.
However, since it is not possible to guarantee that the
measures adopted for the security of the Site and the
transmission of data are such as to exclude any risk of
unauthorized access or data loss, the user is invited
to ensure that their computer is equipped with up-to-date
antivirus software for data network protection - both
inbound and outbound - and that your Internet service
provider has adopted firewall and anti-spam filters, or
other appropriate measures for the security of data transmission.

of the Users to third parties without prior consent and
only to fulfill the specific requests of the Users.

concerning this Policy by sending an email to the address

entitled to:

freely and at any time;
h) contact the owner and manager of the processing of

the content nor the policy on the processing of personal
data of websites and third-party services accessible through
links contained within the Site, including any social
plugin. Therefore it can not under any circumstances be
