Our store offer sales, special orders, service, repairs and DCC installation/programming.  We do consignments and purchase collections.
The store is located in the Hollywood District in Portland and started out in the basement of an old Fred Meyer building in 1993.  In 2004 we moved three blocks to our current location.
