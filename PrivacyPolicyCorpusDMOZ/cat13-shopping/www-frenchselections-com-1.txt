MISSION STATEMENT
I sold Authentic French Specialties in the US for 30 years, through the Joie de Vivre paper catalog and this website. After moving back to France in 2018, I decided to keep the frenchselections website active as a curated repository of resources that would interest my Francophile customers. Frenchselections.com is also the only place where you can purchase my book Moments Parfaits in Paris (sorry, Amazon...)
