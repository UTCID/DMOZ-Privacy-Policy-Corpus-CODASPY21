checkout. All stock is subject to availability.
Product Availability
All products for sale on
http://www.ewm.co.uk/
are subject to availability. If for any reason your order cannot be fulfilled owing to lack of
stock, you will be made aware of this on the web page where you tried to place your order.
Part Delivery
If only part of your order is available, we will dispatch the items that are in stock and cancel
the out-of-stock items.
Product Descriptions
Every product is sold subject to the product description and supporting information such as
size, colour, estimated delivery dates and guarantees. All sizes are in UK standard sizes (Size
Guide). We make every effort to ensure that the product colour is as accurate as possible, but
the colours shown may vary depending upon the setting of your computer monitor. We cannot
guarantee that the colour shown will accurately reflect the colour upon delivery. We will take
all reasonable care to ensure that all of the product details, descriptions and prices are
correct at the time when the information was uploaded onto the website. However, the information
may not always exactly reflect the position when you placed an order. Please note that the
estimated delivery times are only estimates, and cannot be guaranteed. Packaging may vary from
that shown. We reserve the right to refuse orders where the product information, price or
product promotion has been incorrectly published.
Prices
All prices include VAT and are subject to change without prior notice.
The products will be at your risk from the time of delivery.
Ownership of the products will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in
respect of the products, including delivery charges.
The price of any products will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of
obvious error.
These prices, including VAT but excluding delivery costs, will be added to the total amount due
as set out in the delivery information below.
Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which
we have already sent you in a Dispatch Confirmation.
Our site contains a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best
efforts, some of the products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally
verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a products correct price is
less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the product to you.
If a products correct price is higher than the price stated on our website, we will normally,
at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the product, or reject
your order and notify you of such rejection.
We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even
after we have sent you a Dispatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable
and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.
Promotions
We run promotions both in our stores and on
http://www.ewm.co.uk/
. Some of these promotions may be exclusively online, exclusively in-store or only available to
customers in certain areas.
Discounted products available on

have been on sale at the higher marked price either on the web site or in at least one of our
retail stores for at least 28 consecutive days in the last 6 months.

to participate in offers, decline to accept orders where, in its opinion, an offer code is
invalid for the order being placed and amend these terms and conditions (The Edinburgh Woollen
Mill will use reasonable endeavors to notify changes to all customers).
Products sold in a 3 for 2 Promotions can be mixed and matched with other items
on the same promotion. The cheapest item will be free. If Multiple 3 for 2 promotions are

If you'd like to have items sent to separate addresses, please complete a separate order for
each address. A separate delivery charge will be made for each address.
In some countries you may need to sign for an international delivery. Please check with your
local postal services if you are unsure.
Customs Duty, Excise & Other Local Taxes
In some countries, mainly outside the European Union, the receiver of the package may be liable
for taxes, fees or other charges that are imposed by local laws or legislation in your country.
The recipient of the order is responsible for all customs formalities relating to their import
and where required to do so will need to pay any additional charges, including import duty,
customs charges, taxes, levies and any other charges. The recipient of the goods, not the person
who's ordered them, will receive a separate request for payment of these charges.
If you are ordering goods for delivery to someone else please make sure they are aware of the
possibility of these additional payments and that they will be responsible for payment. Since we
have no control over these charges we are unable to predict what they may be and consequently we
are unable to provide any assistance with these processes.
Edinburgh Woollen Mill has no control over these import regulations or additional charges and we
suggest you contact the local authorities or postal service in the destination country for
further advice.
Prices, Taxes and Payment
The website will charge and take payment in £ Pound Sterling. All prices shown on the site are
inclusive of local UK (Value Added Tax) VAT at 20% and if you are in an EU country currently,
this will be the price you pay. Orders for Non EU destinations will not be charged VAT and will
have this deducted at checkout. Copy invoices are available from within your online account
control panel. Simply login to your account for details.
Payment methods available include AMEX, Mastercard, VISA & PayPal.
Tracking Your Order
You can review the status of your order at any time by logging in to your account section of our
website and checking order information.
If you would like any help in finding out the status of your order or tracking its delivery
progress, please contact our customer services team via email on
customerenquiries@ewm.co.uk
or contact our customer services team direct on UK Freephone 0808 202 0242 or International +44
