Freshness
Guarantee
We
roast our beans Monday through Thursday for maximum freshness. All orders are shipped
fresh, usually within 24 to 72 hours after roasting, depending on such factors as flavoring, grinding, and in-stock availability. Depending on your shipping
preference, you are able to order and receive your coffee within
approximately 5 to 6 business days of the roasting process. This gives you the
freshest possible coffee you can get without going to the roaster
directly, which is not usually possible, or roasting it yourself.
The coffee that you buy at the grocery store or local coffee shop
which can be "gourmet coffee", has sometimes been sitting in a container
that is not vacuum sealed for possibly months at a time, depending
on the popularity of the coffee or espresso flavor. So not only
is it old (all coffee should be used within 3 - 4 weeks of roasting),
but it is stale due to the environment it is kept in. All of our
coffees are shipped fresh and in resealable bags with CO2 valves.
