Term Definitions
“Non-personal data” is information that in no way can personally identify any individual.
“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by name, identification number, location, online identifier or to any factor specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. Personal data is, in many ways, the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, personal data is broader in scope and covers more data.
“Personal Information” is both device information and order information.
