EMAIL LIST
SkywayTools.com maintains an opt-in only email list so we can contact our customers and let them know about tools we have on sale. We have been in business online since 1995 and we have NEVER shared one single email address with any other person or business. We send out an email about twice a month. At the bottom of each email you will find a link to unsubscribe from the list, if you wish. We have no desire to annoy you by sending you an email if you don't want to hear from us. Once you have unsubscribed from the list by following the directions on the email, your email address will be permanently removed from the list.

SkywayTools.com customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested by the customer.
