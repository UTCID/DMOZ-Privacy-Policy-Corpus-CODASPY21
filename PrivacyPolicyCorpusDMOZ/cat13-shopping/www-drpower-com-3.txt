DR Power Equipment reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time. DR Power Equipment does not endorse companies or products to which it links and reserves the right to note as such on its web pages.

PRICING/AVAILABILITY
All prices on this site are in U.S. dollars and subject to change at any time. In the event of an incorrect price, we reserve the right to correct pricing errors at the time of sale. For deliveries and pick-ups, we will add applicable state sales tax.
Prices and availability of products on the website are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected as discovered. Our website contains a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products listed on our Website may be incorrectly priced. We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at an incorrect price if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.
You acknowledge on occasion, you may be able to place a product in your shopping cart and submit your order for processing, but your order is subsequently cancelled due to unavailability of product. In addition, there may be times where it is discovered that products are no longer available after an order is submitted, such as with limited quantities or stock outages from vendors, and we have taken your payment information. In such situations, your order may be subsequently back-ordered, and if we cannot fulfill your order within a reasonable time, your order may be cancelled. Any payments inadvertently taken will be promptly refunded, and is it is our policy not to charge you for an order until the product is shipped.
IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION
Due to a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court, effective July 1, 2018, businesses conducting internet sales and phone sales are now required to collect sales tax in states that have enacted such laws. Sales tax will be collected based on the state the product was delivered and will be remitted back to the same state. States without such laws may require us to send you and the State notification of your purchases at year end, as well as remind you of the obligation to pay any sales tax due with your personal income tax return. Sales tax exemptions can only be requested by submission of a valid sales tax exemption certificate issued by your State tax department in advance to DR Power Equipment, 800 Hinesburg Road, S. Burlington, VT 05403. Sorry no exceptions.
We are unable to process sales tax exemptions for on-line orders. If your order is tax exemption eligible it must be placed though our call center at 1-800-687-6575 and you will be required to provide a valid exemption certificate. Once an order is processed, we are unable to refund sales tax and you must contact your state's tax department with refund requests.
