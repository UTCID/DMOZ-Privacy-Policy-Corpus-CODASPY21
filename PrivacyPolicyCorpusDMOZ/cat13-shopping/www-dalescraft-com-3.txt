Returns and refunds
It's really very simple no complicated process to go throughIn 25 years of making Pyrography blanks we have had less than a handful of return requests so we make it very easy.Email sales@pyrographyblanks.co.uk to request a return with the reasonwhen your return is accepted send the parcel to us by the method indicated in the email we will send you.Once we receive the products back we will issue you with a refund.We don't issue refunds for return postage for items that are simply no longer required but if you receive damaged or non working products we will refund your return postage.Thats it really we abide by all of the distance selling and sale of goods act regulations and just want you to be happy with your purchase like the thousands of other customers we have had throughout the years.
