Online Information Collection
When you place an order, in order to process the request properly, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and its expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

Why GotYourBack is Safe
Our SSL secure server software is among the industry standard and some of the best software available for today's demanding e-commerce sites. By encrypting all of your personal and credit information, including your card number, name, and address, it cannot be read by anyone attempting to gain your information via computer. Also, when shoping at GotYourBack, you'll be one in a large number of customers who have already safely shopped with us without any instances of credit card fraud.
Guarantee Details:
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, GotYourBack will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. GotYourBack will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at GotYourBack while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
