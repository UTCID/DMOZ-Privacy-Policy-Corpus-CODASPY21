Privacy Policy
MindTraining.net's policy has always been that we do not
rent, sell or disclose any information whatsoever - about our customers, clients, and those who sign up to our email newsletters -
to any third parties, as we take the utmost care in totally protecting
your information.
This also extends to financial information supplied for product purchases, where no-one from MindTraining.net, or its staff, ever
access any financial or credit card details whatsoever, as these are
exclusively handled by PayPal with their online security and encryption.
In short, this website, and all of its staff:
* do NOT collect, share, sell, rent or disclose any information about our customers for the purpose of marketing, or profiting from this information in any way
* ensure that only those who willingly opt-in to our email newsletter may receive a periodic email from us - and us, only - never any third parties.
* do NOT
place cookies on your computer
* do NOT view, have access to, or store financial or credit card details, of purchasing customers - as PayPal processes all payments (you may also wish to read PayPal's privacy policy).
* We do use Google Analytics to check the stats of our website - a service offered by Google to track and report our website traffic, which most websites also use around the world.  As Google's data may be shared with their other services, you can opt-out of them collecting any information by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available to the main browsers such as Chrome, Firefox etc.
Needless to say, we know that you have no interest in hearing from us unless you actually consciously choose to do so, by emailing us etc.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page, but dont hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns.
