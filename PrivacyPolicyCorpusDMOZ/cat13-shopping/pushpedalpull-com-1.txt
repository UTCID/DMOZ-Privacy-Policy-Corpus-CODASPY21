This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the personal information that you provide to us on this web site.

Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using this Web Site or submitting information to us. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of this Web Site is acceptance of such changes, so please check this area periodically for updates to this Privacy Policy.
1. INFORMATION PUSH PEDAL PULL COLLECTS FROM YOU
Active Information Collection  Like many other web sites, we actively collect information from our visitors both by asking specific questions on this Web Site and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via email. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.).
Passive Information Collection  As you navigate through a web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection. Like most web site operators, we track IP addresses, use both session and persistent cookies, and assign Internet tags. Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on this Web Site and collects operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems, and Internet service providers. We passively collect information to understand what areas of this Web Site are most popular, which areas may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by our visitors. This information helps us to update and improve this Web Site. We also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.
2. HOW PUSH PEDAL PULL USES YOUR INFORMATION  Push Pedal Pull uses your personal information to enhance the operation of this Web Site and allow you to use all of its features. Push Pedal Pull may contact you about new features or products in which it believes you may be interested. Push Pedal Pull may disclose your personal information to the reputable vendors that assist us in processing information or delivering the items that our customers order. These vendors are restricted from using the information for any purpose other than helping us to provide products and services. Push Pedal Pull may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, online traffic patterns and related information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. Push Pedal Pull also will disclose any information that it is required to disclose by law or by an appropriate government authority.
Although Push Pedal Pull does not currently rent, sell, or otherwise share your information with third parties for purposes unrelated to this Web Site, it may do so in the future. If you do not want your information to be shared, you should contact us at p3@pushpedalpull.com.
3. CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW PUSH PEDAL PULL USES YOUR INFORMATION  We strive to provide you with as many choices and as much control as possible regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information. You may also opt out of receiving marketing messages from Push Pedal Pull by notifying us at p3@pushpedalpull.com.
If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this Web Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
You should review this Privacy Policy carefully, because if you do not agree with our practices, your ultimate choice is not to use this Web Site. Remember, by using any part of this Web Site, you accept and agree to our privacy practices. If we update this Privacy Policy, your continued use of this Web Site (following the posting of the revised Privacy Policy) means that you accept and agree to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
4. HOW PUSH PEDAL PULL PROTECTS YOUR INFORMATION  We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases by storing data received via the Web Site in an access-controlled database.
This Web Site contains links to other web sites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you. We cannot control these third party sites, which may collect personal information from you. When you follow a link and leave this Web Site, you do so at your own risk.
