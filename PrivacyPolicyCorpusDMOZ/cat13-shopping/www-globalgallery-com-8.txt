When Will My Order Ship?
Since each item is printed on demand and custom made especially for you, our orders do not ship immediately. Once ordered, one of our curators will personally reach out to you to provide an “estimated shipment date” on when you can expect to receive your shipment confirmation. However, please use these shipment guidelines below. The following shipment timelines may vary depending on the size and materials chosen. These shipment timelines are not exact, so please reach out to us if you need an immediate ship date.

7-10 Business Days
What are the shipping charges?
Shipping charges for orders vary depending on the contents of the order as well as the destination.
Your exact shipping charge is quoted immediately upon adding an item to your cart and selecting the destination in the "shipping to" drop box.Due to occasional rate variations on international shipments (shipments to destinations outide of the contiguous USA, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico), customers may be contacted for additional payment should shipping charges exceed the collected amount at initial checkout.
International Duties
In some cases you may be required to pay local or national import duties or taxes to your local customs office.
We have no means to determine in advance if you will be taxed or what these taxes may amount to.
We recommend you research and contact your local customs bureau to determine if you will be required to pay any additional duties.
Shipping Confirmation
Upon shipment of your order, we will send you an e-mail confirmation of your orders shipment including tracking information (where applicable). Some items may ship separately depending on the shipping service required. Please allow 24 to 48 hours for your tracking information to update.
Shipping Delays & Problems
We recommend that you wait until the end of the estimated delivery time range before you inquire with us as to your order's status. While we have the utmost faith in our shipping and delivery partners, some delays and problems can occur from time to time. Below are some solutions and answers to some of the more common problems.
Delivery Delays
There are several common reasons a delivery is delayed, and in many cases results in the original shipment being returned to our production facility center. In all these cases you will be contacted immediately and the situation will be resolved.
Incorrect or invalid shipping address
Recipient unavailable to receive delivery
Shipment damaged/destroyed in transit
Lost Shipments
If you feel that your shipment has been lost, please contact us immediately and we will determine if it is actually lost or just delayed. If it is lost, a replacement order will be processed and shipped immediately. We cannot track or trace international shipments, therefore we cannot deem them lost until 60 days after the shipping date. When 60 days has passed, an insurance claim will be filed and a replacement shipment will go out immediately, at no additional charge.
