We Try Hard to Please Our Customers!
Here is what they say about us.  These comments have not been edited or
even spell checked.
You guys are great.  I couldn't find these louvers
anywhere else, and you got them to me quick with no mistakes.  Thanks!
EA, San Antonio

The shipment arrived in a timely manner
Thanks
I am very impressed by your company.  This is the first
time I used your company but it will not be the last. I will always check your
inventory first before ordering elsewhere. Your prices are excellent and the
delivery was much quicker than expected.

Very pleased with product. Product was received in timely manner. Will
visit your site again.
I
was apprehensive at first to buy from your website as I had never heard of your
company before.  I was directed to
you from Mil.web site.  However, I
am so happy I made my purchase with your company.  Not only did I get the right bulb for my
TV but it was fast delivery and a quality product.  Thanks for being so efficient and for
selling top quality products.
Sincerely,
Chandra
It was recewived
just a few days after the order was placed. Thanks,

I received my order within a
week. I'm very satisfied with my order. The L shaped glass desk is much bigger
than in the picture...which made me very happy. Thanks a lot.
Service great and the product is exactly what i wanted.  May
the Light Be with you this day

Thank you for following up on my recent order. I was
thrilled to find a roof rake for sale online, since every local store and
online vendor was out of stock.  I don't know what kind of a winter you
had where you are, but here in the Northeast roof rakes became a coveted item
and everyone was desperate to find one.
I persisted with my web search and when I found your site I was so surprised to
see that it was not marked as out of stock. Honestly when I placed the order I
was certain I would get an email telling me it was not available.  But I
didn't get that email, and in fact I didn't hear anything after the order
confirmation.  After a week or so after not getting any kind of shipping
notice, I figured my order would just go in a queue and might ship in the
spring.  I figured at least I would have it for next winter.
Then it miraculously showed up at my door, and I was so impressed with its
quality.  It is nothing like the cheap plastic versions I had been seeing
on other online stores. One thing, though, is that the long cardboard box that
contained the poles had been crushed during transit, and the ends of the poles
were somewhat flattened where they are supposed to slide and lock into each
other.  I was able to pound them back into shape enough to get them to
slide together though, so no worries.
So if you are looking for honest feedback, I might suggest
some packing protection (plastic bracket or something) for soft metals like
aluminum, especially for parts that need to fit together like the roof
rake.  I also might suggest some kind of shipping notification so your
customers will know their items are on the way.  I was shocked to see my
item at the door because I didn't even know it had shipped.
Thank you for making this fine product available -- I am
sure it will last a lifetime and it is money well spent (even with the crazy
shipping charge for the over-sized package!) .  I
will check your site first when I am looking for tools or other equipment, and
maybe we can do business again.
Thanks again for following up.
Regards,  Lauri
Excellent service/product.
We got it!  Thanks very much for the prompt service.

... I bought these gloves for years at a local hardware store and for
professional reasons I refuse to shop at that hardware store anymore.  The problem was I couldn't find th=
ese
specific gloves anywhere else so I turned to the internet.  Not only was the price reasonable =
but
the gloves (made by the same co.) were better quality.
I
am overjoyed and I will continue to shop at the builde=
rdepot.  Thanks for being there :).

This was=
our
first experience with BuilderDepot. We were both very pleased with the
purchase. I am equally impressed that you took the time out of a busy workd=
ay
to send an e-mail about the order. It's the personal touch like this that m=
akes
return customers. In the future, I can assure you that I will be checking BuilderDepot's inventory before I make a purcha=
se
elsewhere. Thank you again for going the extra mile. It is indeed a pleasure
doing business with your company.

Ordered it online, as you know, and it came super-quick and I am very
happy.  Thank you for checking.
- Sandy
Yes, eve=
rything
is fine.  I was wondering why the cost through you was so much more ex=
pensive then=
in the store, however now I
know.  I thought I was buying 3 boxes with 20' of edging, instead I
received 6 boxes.  I guess too much is better than not enough!  H=
ave
a wonderful day, and if my leftovers do not fill my neighbors needs, I will pass them along to=
your
website.

Thanks f=

The wind=

the
wells right away. As a single woman, I appreciated how easy they were to
install (I hate playing the helpless female gig!). And the price and ease of
ordering over the Internet took away my hassle of wandering around a store
looking like a brain-dead blonde. =
Better
