Babycare TENS understands that in order to address our impact on the environment, we need a sustained approach to environmental management activity. Therefore Babycare TENS has a clear responsibility in implementing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations (WEEE).
WEEE from private households can be returned to us on a one-to-one basis. This is providing that the WEEE returned is of equivalent type to, and has fulfilled the same function as any new Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) that is purchased.
Babycare TENS has joined a compliance scheme to meet its WEEE obligations.
You may dispose of waste WEEE at your local civic amenity site or alternatively we offer in-storereturns for our household users free of charge.
If you purchase a new unit from us and wish to send us your old unit or the like, you can mail it to the following address.
Babycare TENS is not responsible to pay for postage:
