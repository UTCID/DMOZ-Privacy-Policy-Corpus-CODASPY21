My Money Back Guarantee
You will get your money back if PainBreak® works for you or if it doesn’t. Think of the Shipping and Handling as a “Good Faith Deposit” . The PainBreak® is free! Ask for your money back if PainBreak® doesn’t work for you and I will promptly refund it. If PainBreak® works for you as it has for many others I will give you a free tube with your Get Acquainted Special Order. Fair enough?
Unique Enterprises has been doing business online since 1998. Over the years, thousands of customers have placed orders from my web-sites — privately, safely and securely.
In order to demonstrate my firm commitment to you, my website patrons and customers, I’d like to share my policies on information gathering, privacy, security, returns, unsolicited e-mail, and more…
1. Your Personal Information:
My site uses forms for information requests and orders. Contact information from all forms (including name, address, e-mail address, payment info, etc.) is used to process and deliver orders and mail information about my company to my customers. Any financial information my customers submit, such as credit card number and expiration date is used only to charge the customer for products and services they are purchasing.
2. Security:
This site has extensive security measures in place to protect the loss misuse and alteration of the information under my control. All orders are processed using SSL technology via a secure server. All customer contact information including credit card number and name and address is guarded with the utmost security and discretion.
3. Unsolicited E-mail:
I do not , nor do I condone the use of unsolicited bulk e-mail. I take this issue very seriously.
4. Subscribe/Unsubscribe:
I offer a free e-reports, “Everything You Want To Know About Shingles And PHN, But Did Not Know Whom To Ask.” I never rent this opt-in list of e-mail addresses. I do however, advertise in each issue and send special alerts and promotion/sale announcements to my subscribers from time to time (average quarterly).
