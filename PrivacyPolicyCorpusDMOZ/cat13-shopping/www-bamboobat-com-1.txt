Store Customers Frequently Asked QuestionsHow secure is my transaction?All online transactions at Yahoo! Stores are handled with industry-standard SSL encryption.When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to us.For added security, we also encrypt the credit card number when it is stored on disk, and when we forward it to the merchant.If you are not the kind of person who worries about being hit by lightning as you're crossing the street, you probably don't have to worry that your credit card number will be intercepted on the way to a secure Web site.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------How can I buy something in a store? Buying from a Yahoo! Store is easy and secure. You don't have to fill out a registration form or download software to shop here. And when you place an order, you can feel confident that your credit card information is protected by our secure server.For every in-stock item, there will be an button. This button adds the item to your shopping basket. Putting something in your shopping basket does not commit you to buying it. After you put something in your shopping basket, you can choose to place the order immediately, or continue shopping.You can put as many items as you want in your shopping basket. When you're finished and want to place the order, you can get back to your shopping basket by clicking on the Show Order button.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Are you having trouble making an order? If you click on the Order button and get no response, it is probably because you can't connect securely to our server.As a test, try going to https://www.microsoft.com. If you can't connect securely to Microsoft either, thenYou have a very, very old browser, in which case you should upgrade. Or you are behind a corporate firewall that won't allow secure connections. Ask your network administrator to fix it, or order from home. Is Yahoo! responsible for delivering my purchase? No, Yahoo! hosts the store site and does not own the store. All transactions are the sole responsibility of the merchant and every store makes its own delivery arrangement as indicated on its site.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Your IP AddressWe use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.
