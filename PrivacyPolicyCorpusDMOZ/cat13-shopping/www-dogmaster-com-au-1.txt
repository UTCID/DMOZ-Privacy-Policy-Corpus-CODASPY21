Any system returned to us should include the original content that came with the package. Eg DVD, manuals, batteries etc.
If you decide to return your rental unit for a refund of the security deposit, the amount of security deposit returned to you will be the amount paid unless the condition of the returned unit displays excessive wear & tear or abuse and in this circumstance the security deposit or part thereof will be kept to make good such "wear and tear".
