Privacy and
Security Information
Your Privacy:
Waxman's Carpet & Rug Warehouse respects
your privacy and keeps your personal information private.  We do not rent,
sell, or share your personal information with anyone.
Your Security:
Our Online Shopping service uses a secure
server to enter your credit card information. The Web site service uses Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) encryption, the industry standard. This technology encrypts your
credit card information before being sent over the Internet, when using secure
Internet browser software.
Some versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
display a gold padlock on the bottom right of the screen in the secure mode.
Another way to know that a Web site is secured by SSL is when the URL starts
with the letters https: instead of http: .  You should see at the browser
address bar up top www.aitsafe.com/secure address information while placing your
secure order. Unfortunately, no E-commerce system can guarantee 100% protection
for your credit card.
If you prefer you can place your order by
phone using our toll free number. TOLL

You can also
email us with your phone number and the area rug(s) or item(s) you would
like to order, and we will call you back to take your order over the phone.
