HomeStore Policies
Store Policies
Every product listed for sale on our site is guaranteed to be a 100% brand-new, factory-boxed product, unless clearly specified otherwise.
WARRANTY: Every item we sell is covered by a manufacturer's warranty, the length of which is determined by the manufacturer of that product. If the manufacturer of any brand we sell declines to provide warranty for web sales, we will provide a parellel Sounds Great warranty for up to 1 year. There are exclusions to this policy presented in the section directly below this one. You must obtain and use an RA# (Return Authorization Number) for every item to be returned to us.
RETURNS/REFUND: Items may be returned within 30 days of purchase, for exchange or refund. A 15% restocking fee applies to items that are returned in brand new, unopened condition. Items returned that are not in new, unopened condtion will be assessed a restocking fee to be determined by their condition upon arrival at our location.  Return Authorization is required.  Custom items, such as vehicle specific subwoofer enclosures and kick panels are subject to a 35% restock fee when returned in new condition.  Items that have been incorrectly installed or have been subject to user damage are not eligible for return.
EXCLUSIONS: Warranty protection does not cover abuse, misuse, installer error, weather damage, "blown" speakers nor items that have become physically and/or cosmetically damaged after removing them from the box. Sounds Great will not be held responsible for such damage. We strongly urge the use of professional, certified installers. We will not be held responsible for incidental costs that may be incurred in connection with defective or returned products, including but not limited to installation, removal or reinstallation costs, shipping charges, temporary loss of use, or damage to your vehicle or other components.
SPECIAL EXCLUSION FOR ALARMS, REMOTE START, KEYLESS ENTRY AND CONVENIENCE SYSTEMS: All Alarms/Remote Starts/Remote Controls sold on site are brand new, factory packed with all original documentation. The ONLY recourse for product repair/replacement is through the manufacturer. Further, once installation has been attempted, the manufacturer may decline to service the system under warranty unless the unit has been installed by and submitted for warranty by a dealer that they have previously designated as an authorized installer. Accordingly, your purchase indicates your acceptance of our TERM OF SALE for this product category as a FINAL SALE item. Installation of this product category may present unforeseeable challenges. We do not provide Tech Support. Therefore, we strongly recommend professional installation.
ORDERS: We endeavor to ship most orders within 24 hours. If an item proves to be on backorder, we will notify you promptly at which time you may a)Cancel your order b)Make an alternate selection c)Notify us that you will wait. To modify or cancel an order prior to shipping, use our secure on-line form to contact customer support, and reference the order number appearing on your invoice. Once shipped, your order cannot be changed or canceled. Some items are "drop-shipped" by our manufacturer's and distributors. Our drop shippers do not always provide tracking information. Universal Subwoofer Boxes typically take 2-6 business days to ship.
CUSTOM AND VEHICLE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS are to be considered "special order" products. Once placed with the manufacturer, orders for these items may not be cancelled. Although we endeavor to obtain these custom items quickly, at times 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before we recieve them from the manufacturer. Your order for any such item, whether by phone or on this web site, constitutes your acceptance of our clearly stated "TERM OF SALE" that such purhchase is a FINAL SALE which may not be cancelled. Vehicle speficic adapters and interface units likewise fall under this policy.
SUBSTITUTION: We may at times substitute minor installation parts (antenna adapter, wire harness, dash kit)for one of equal quality from another manufacturer. We will not do this with parts over $30 w/o notifying your first, nor will we substitute inferior parts nor parts with significant cosmetic differences.
SHIPPING: We endeavor to ship most orders within 24-48 hours. Most items will ship via UPS Ground and tracking #'s will be automatically forwarded to you. Many smaller items will be shipped via USPS. The Postal Service does not provide tracking #'s. At times, you will have the option to upgrade your shipping service for an additional fee. Such a selection does not hasten the delivery of a special order item to us from the manufacturer. When you select an expedited level of shipping, your are indicating your acceptance of our TERM OF SALE that such selection will not speed up delivery of your special order item from the manufacturer to us, but will only decrease the subsequent ship time to you from us after we have received your order from the manufacturer.
NOTIFICATION: Be advised that UPS reports approximately 50% of tracking notices go undelivered due to spam blockers and outdated email addresses. Further, once issued, we place the retrieval of previously issued tracking numbers at the lowest priority for our customer service staff.
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Many items offered for sale are eligible for international shipping. Such orders are shipped via U.S. Priority Mail only. PayPal is the only payment form accepted, and PayPal must authorize shipment to your address or your order will be cancelled.
SECURITY: Your personal information and email address will not be shared with anyone. See our Privacy Statement. If you are paying via credit card, we will ship only to the registered billing address for that credit card. If you are paying via PayPal, we will ship only to the address authorized by PayPal. Please register any additional addresses with these payment services before placing your order. We may require additional information to verify your identidy before accepting your order, and delivery of your package may require an adult signature by the carrier. Your current "IP" address will be recorded at checkout for security purposes. We actively assist the authorities in pursuing those who attempt to committ fraud.
