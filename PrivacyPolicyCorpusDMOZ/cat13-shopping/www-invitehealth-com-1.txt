Return Policy
If you are not completely satisfied with the products you have purchased from Invite Health, you may return unopened merchandise with a receipt within 30 days to receive a money-back refund. Returns cannot be made without a receipt. A store credit will be provided for the return of opened merchandise with a receipt within 30 days.
Please note: Amazon purchases cannot be returned or exchanged by InVite Health directly, since Amazon restricts credit card information. Amazon purchases must be returned through Amazon itself.
We select the most effective delivery system for each
individual nutrient to ensure maximum absorption by the body. For example, we
use Licaps® liquid-filled vegetarian capsules for many of our products. This
technology offers optimal absorption because the liquid material allows your
body to absorb the nutrients very quickly.
To ensure you receive receipts for your purchases, please make sure we have your email address on file. To update your account information, sign into your account online, visit an Invite retail location or give us a call at (800) 349-0929. Having your email address on file ensures you will never lose a receipt.
All customer information is kept confidential. We do not give, rent or sell our customer information. Customer information is kept for company records only.
Return to Retail Locations
Bring your unopened merchandise to any Invite Health location with a receipt to receive your return in the original form of payment. Returns cannot be made without a receipt. A store credit will be provided for a return of opened merchandise with a receipt within 30 days. You must bring the form of payment used to make the purchase to receive a credit, if applicable.
To find a store near you, visit www.invitehealth.com or

Return by Mail
To initiate your return by mail, please contact our Customer Service Department Please send your purchase and receipt to our Customer Service Department. You are responsible for the cost of return shipping. Please send your return to:

Attn: Returns

What should I do if my merchandise arrives damaged or defective?
We make every effort to package your order so that it will arrive in great condition. However, due to reasons beyond our control, items may be damaged during shipment. We will do everything we can to replace the product as quickly as possible.
If you have received a damaged item, please e-mail us at customerservice@invitehealth.com or call us at (800) 349-0929. Provide us your name, order number and the item that was damaged and we will arrange for the damaged item to be replaced immediately.
What happens to my reward points when I return products?
If a return is made that was partially paid with reward points, the return is processed so that the money-back is off of the sales amount paid by the customer, not the total amount before the reward points were added. The reward points obtained during this sale will be removed from your account.
Still have questions? Our customer service team is ready to help, Monday - Friday from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST. Please visit our Contact Us page where you can connect via phone, email or live chat.
