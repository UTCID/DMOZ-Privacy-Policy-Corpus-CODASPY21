Our Policy for Protecting Your Online Privacy
This website uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, from Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage
with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors
interact with their website so that they can improve it.
Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions, as
in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site and to
compile statistical reports on website activity.
In addition to the standard Google Analytics
data we also use a subset of this data, called Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting,
to help us target our products and information to the users most likely to use our site.
We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally
identifiable information previously collected unless we have robust notice of, and the user's
prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.
Opt Out
Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying
individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site
– for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you
use, you can use the Google Analytics opt-out browser
add-on that is available for many current browsers.
