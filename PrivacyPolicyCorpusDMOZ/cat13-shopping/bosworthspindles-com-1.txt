Terms & Conditions
Your satisfaction with our tools is our goal; we do our best to accommodate your needs wherever possible. All spinning tools are handmade in our workshop in Acton, Massachusetts.
Payment:
Preferred payment is personal check/money order or PayPal. For international orders, PayPal is the preferred method of payment.
Because of the high costs of credit card processing, there is a $20 minimum for credit card purchases. We accept MasterCard and VISA.
Payment is expected when your items are shipped, unless arrangements are made in advance or a deposit is required (see below).
A $100 deposit is requested at the time of order for all Charkhas; the balance plus shipping charges is due at the time of shipping. If you cancel your order before it ships, we will refund half of your deposit.
We are happy to arrange “lay-away” payments at a convenient schedule for you. Please ask!
Returned Checks: Returned checks are subject to a $25 fee.
Credit Card Payments: There is a $20 minimum for credit card purchases. We accept MasterCard and VISA. If your credit card is declined, we will notify you immediately. Sometimes it is a simple reason, easy to correct. If we cannot get an approval for your card, we will request a PayPal transfer for payment.
Damages: We send your order sturdily packed for shipping. However, we cannot be responsible for USPS or UPS handling for uninsured packages, nor can we be responsible for loss or damage of goods resulting from incomplete or incorrect addresses provided to us. All Journey Wheels and Charkhas are sent fully insured for your protection.
Returns & Refunds: We will accept merchandise returns, no questions asked, within 30 days of your purchase. If you are unhappy with something from our workshop, please let us know how we can make it right for you. We cannot accept items that have obviously been used or are not in “new” condition. Refunds will be issued in the form of a shop credit only. Returns after more than 30 days are subject to a 25% restocking fee.
Prices: Please note that all prices are subject to change without notice. We will confirm the price of your items at the time of your order.
Privacy: Your privacy is very important to us; we do not share our customer information with anyone.
