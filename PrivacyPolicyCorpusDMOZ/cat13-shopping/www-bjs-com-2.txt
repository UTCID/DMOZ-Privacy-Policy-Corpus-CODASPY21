Colors. We have done our best to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on the Site. However, because the colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
Gift Cards and Gifts of Membership. All BJ’s Gift Cards and Gifts of Membership are deemed purchased in and issued from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Gift Cards cannot be used as a form of payment for merchandise purchased on the Site.
Alcohol Transactions
BJ’s endeavors to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not sold or delivered to anyone who is under the age of 21 or outside of the United States. You may have the option to order delivery of alcohol products from select BJ’s Club locations and where permitted by law. Alcohol product availability and quantity vary by state due to differing state regulations. Alcoholic sales, including the delivery thereof, are not available for those under the age of 21. A valid proof of age is required for all transactions involving alcohol. Any alcohol purchased from BJ’s must be for personal consumption and not for resale. If you intentionally or unintentionally misrepresent your age in order to obtain or provide alcohol to a person under the age of 21, we will report this to the appropriate authorities, prosecute you fully to the extent allowable by law, and terminate your membership.
Upon any delivery involving alcohol, BJ’s delivery partners (“Driver”) will ask to see the recipient’s valid government-issued ID (e.g., driver’s license) to confirm recipient is 21 or older to receive the order. The recipient will also be required to sign for the order. Failure to provide a valid ID will prevent the Driver from completing the delivery. If the recipient is visibly intoxicated, the Driver reserves the right to refuse to deliver the order. In the event the recipient is unable to sign for the order (i.e., not home), unable to provide a valid ID, or visibly intoxicated, the order will be returned to the Club and your credit/debit card will be refunded.
By using this site to order alcohol, you swear and affirm and represent to us that you (and the recipient) are over the age of 21. If for any reason it is found that you (or the recipient) are under the age of 21, you and/or the recipient agree to indemnify BJ’s and/or reimburse us and be responsible for all costs, expenses (including legal fees) and damages BJ’s suffers or incurs. You also swear and affirm and represent to us that any alcohol purchased from BJ’s is intended for personal consumption and not for resale. If you cannot make these affirmations and representations or you do not agree with all of these conditions of use please do not use this site to order alcohol.
After you place an order for alcohol through this site, we will check the transactional information you give us for validity and compliance with state laws and regulations, by verifying your method of payment or shipping address. We may, at our own discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. We also reserve the right to reject any order you place with us. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same web site account, the same credit card, and orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail address provided at the time the order was made. We do not sell alcohol to dealers. Your credit or debit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if the charge has been made against your card.
Passwords and Security. If you use a password to access this Site or any portion of it, then you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur on your account or with your password. In the event that the confidentiality of your account or password is compromised in any manner, you will notify BJ’s immediately. BJ’s reserves the right to take any and all action as it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Site and your account, including without limitation, terminating your account, changing your password or requesting information to authorize transactions on your account. While BJ’s takes prudent steps to protect your account and the Site, it cannot protect your information outside of the Site. When you send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically.

NON-MEMBER SHOPPING
Non-members may shop online at any time, but all online purchases are subject to a 5% non-member surcharge over and above BJ’s listed prices on all merchandise if the purchaser does not enter his or her valid BJ’s Membership Number at the time of online checkout, unless the purchaser: 1. enrolls as a BJ’s Member during checkout; or 2. enters at checkout the applicable promotional code provided in special marketing offers made available to the purchaser. If a shopper purchases a BJ’s Membership within 7 days of a non-member purchase, any non-member surcharge paid may be applied toward the Membership fee if the shopper contacts BJ’s Member Care and provides sufficient information to identify the purchase transaction applying the surcharge.
