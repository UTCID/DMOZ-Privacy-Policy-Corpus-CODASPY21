Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices
you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make
this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every
point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:

On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive
materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example,
if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you

with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for
another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only
used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving
the gift.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses

The Use of Shipping Data & Information:
1/ From time to time a registered customer may require to add the personal details of another individual or a different address from that registered under their own account. This is often due to an alternative shipping address being preferred, such as a business premises instead of a private one or on the occasion when a purchased item is a gift for somebody not registered with CCB Aviation Ltd.
If any shipping details (name and address) supplied during the placing of an order are different to that of the registered account holder, the user must acknowledge that any details provided are done so with full permission and consent. This can easily be done by selecting the check-box option within the shipping section of the checkout stage of the shopping cart, or by amending the Shipping Data within the Account Maintenance section of the registered account holder.
2/ Occasionally we may require a third party such as an Artist, Publisher or other Trade Supplier to ship directly an item purchased on behalf of CCB Aviation Ltd. Each registered customer is required to give their consent that the name & address details selected on the order may be shared for this purpose. Consent can be given by enabling the check-box provided during registration, within the Account Maintenance section of registered account holders or within the shipping section of the checkout cart.
