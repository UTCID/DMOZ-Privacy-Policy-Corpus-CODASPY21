When you visit our website or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You
consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by
posting notices on this site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other
communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such

Your Account
If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password
and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that
occur under your account or password. If you are under 18, you may use this site only with involvement
of a parent or guardian. Rocky Mountain Group of Companies reserves the right to refuse service,
terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in their sole discretion.
Orders and Pricing
Use of and orders placed on this website are governed by the laws and the courts of the province of
Saskatchewan, and by the applicable laws of Canada. The user is also responsible for complying with
these laws.
We may correct errors or inaccuracies and change or update information on this website at any time
without notice, including prices and item availability. All sizes and weights quoted are approximate. All
prices listed are in Canadian dollars and all charges will be processed in Canadian dollars. All prices listed
on this site are subject to confirmation. You agree to pay all charges payable for your order. We reserve
the right to limit the quantity of items that you may buy. We also reserve the right to cancel orders at
our discretion.
Items in your Shopping Cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product
detail page. This price may differ from the price shown for the item when you first placed it in your cart.
Placing an item in your cart doesn't reserve the price shown at that time. It is also possible that an item's
price may increase or decrease between the time you place it in your cart and the time you purchase it.
Some discounts are limited-time offers. The discount we are able to offer for any item is dependent
upon its availability, so Rocky Mountain Fitness’ price will necessarily change on occasion. We cannot
confirm the price of an item until you order; however, we do not charge your credit card until after your
order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our
catalogue may be mispriced. If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our
discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of
such cancellation.
