Learn shipping cost before you buy! You can compare costs of each domestic shipping method at order checkout after entering your name and address but before entering your credit card information. The shopping cart will compute your order total based on the products you ordered, your tax status (no tax outside of Colorado), and your chosen shipping method.
In-Store Pick UpFor our customers with a Colorado address on the order, you will have the option of free In-Store Pickup as a shipping method upon checkout. At the point you choose a shipping method, choose "In-Store Pick Up $0.00". We will email you when your order is ready. Find our retail store in the (click for map) Hampden Square Shopping Center at the extreme northwest corner of S. Wadsworth and W. Hampden Ave. (Hwy 285) in Lakewood.
Shipping Outside Continental U.S.A. Our international shipping charges do not include any customs or brokerage fees which may be due upon delivery. Any such fees are the buyer's responsibility.
Contact these carriers with specific questions about their brokerage fees... UPS: 1-888-253-2748 (USA & Canada); 1-440-243-9326 (outside USA & Canada). USPS: 1-800-275-8777.
Current Order Status You are able to check the status of your online order at any time by visiting your personal My Account page.
Package Track As we finish processing your online order, we will e-mail you a confirmation containing tracking information.
Ordering by Phone Phone-in orders take up more of our time and are processed through our retail store's point-of-sale software and not through the website. We find gathering all your order information over the phone line and hand keying into the system is an opportunity for errors to occur in the order. Also, a customer account with order histories and status e-mails will not be established or updated. Order through the website shopping cart if you prefer speed, accuracy, and convenience. Our business hours are M-F, 9:00 am to 5:30 pm MST. Please have your shopping list with catalog number ready when you call.
