Prices
Prices are in Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Prices and stock availability may vary between the Site and Dymocks stores.
For digital products such as eBooks, prices may be set by the publisher not Dymocks. Publishers reserve the right to alter pricing at any time. It is possible that in the time between adding an item to your shopping cart and completing your purchase, Dymocks may have received a direction from a publisher to alter the price of the digital product. We must, upon receiving a request to alter the price of digital product, comply with that direction. Where compliance with the direction by Dymocks will alter the price of product in your shopping cart, we will alert you to the price change and provide an opportunity for you to remove the item before completing your transaction.
GST
Where a title is shipped from Australia, its price (including any applicable delivery and order charge) is inclusive of Australian goods and services tax. Where a title is shipped from outside Australia its price (including any applicable delivery and order charge) is exclusive of Australian goods and services tax. Where goods and services tax is required to be included, prices are inclusive of goods and services tax.
Cancellation due to error
You acknowledge that, despite our reasonable precautions, products may be listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or like oversight. In these circumstances, we reserve the right to cancel the transaction, notwithstanding that your order has been confirmed and your credit card has been charged. If a cancellation of this nature occurs after your credit card has been charged for the purchase, we will issue a credit to your credit card account for the amount in question.

Security of information
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Whilst we strive to protect such information, we do not warrant and cannot ensure the security of any information which is transmitted to us.

We will not be liable to you for indirect or consequential loss (including without limitation for loss of revenue, loss of profits, failure to realise expected profits or savings and any other commercial or economic loss of any kind) or loss or corruption of data, in contract, tort, under any statute or otherwise arising from or connected to the Site or these Terms of Use.
To the extent permitted by law, any condition or warranty which would otherwise be implied into these Terms of Use is excluded. If legislation implies any condition or warranty, and that legislation voids or prohibits us from excluding or modifying any such term, that term will be deemed included in these Terms of Use.
Nothing in this disclaimer is intended to limit or exclude any liability that cannot be lawfully excluded.
