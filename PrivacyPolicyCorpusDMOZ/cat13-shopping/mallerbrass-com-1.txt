Cookies
When you visit some MallerBrass.coms, their web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies, which helps webmasters understand how users interact with their site’s content and services. MallerBrass.coms use cookies to track one’s activities on a MallerBrass.com (e.g., pages visited, links clicked on, etc.), and to record information about the user so when the user returns to the site, customized features can be provided.
There are two types of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your web browser’s memory cache, and will expire when the browser is closed. A session cookie is not placed on any hard drive, and it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is saved to a file on your hard drive and is accessed whenever you re-visit the MallerBrass.com that put it there. This lets that MallerBrass.com remember what you were interested in the last time you visited.
We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning MallerBrass.com visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to MallerBrass.com until they expire. We may also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the customer satisfaction survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days.
MallerBrass.com may utilize third party services to enhance its distribution of data and information (e.g., videos) through links from the MallerBrass.com web site. A persistent cookie may be set by such a third party provider when you click on the provider’s link in order to access MallerBrass.com data (e.g., play a video).
By default, persistent cookies and web measurement technologies are automatically used when you visit MallerBrass.com. Nevertheless, if you decide to disable or remove cookies from your browser, you will continue to have access to all information and resources on MallerBrass.com.

In these cases, all submitted information is used only for the express purposes for which it is provided, and is not made available to any third party.
