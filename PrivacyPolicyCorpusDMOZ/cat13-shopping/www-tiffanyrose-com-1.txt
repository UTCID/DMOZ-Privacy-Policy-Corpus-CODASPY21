by telephoning 020 8397 0001 / +44 20 8397 0001; or
by posting a completed copy of your Order form to Tiffany Rose, Typhoon Building, Oakcroft Road, Chessington, SURREY, KT9 1RH
When you place an Order for a Product in any of the ways described above ("Order") you are offering to buy it for the price stated, subject to these Terms.
You can Order products displayed on this Website online using a debit or credit card, by using a Tiffany Rose Gift Voucher or by submitting your order form by post and sending us a cheque along with your Order.
On receiving your Order, we will send you an e-mail as confirmation of receipt of your Order.
This email confirmation will be produced automatically so that you have confirmation of your Order details.
The fact that you receive an automatic confirmation does not necessarily mean that we will be able to meet your Order. Once we have sent the confirmation email we will then check availability and if we are unable to meet your order we will let you know by email (or by telephone if you have not provided a valid email address with your order).
Tiffany Rose may cancel any sale and not supply Products if it is reasonable to do so and may change or
discontinue the availability of Products at any time at its sole discretion. If an Order is cancelled,
any payment made for the Products will be refunded in full. This does not affect your Statutory Rights.
Prices
Our prices are shown on our Website in Pounds Sterling (£ GBP), Euros (€ EUR), US Dollars (US $) and Australian Dollars (AU $). For purchases within the EU these prices include VAT at the prevailing UK rate.We try to make sure that the prices on our Website are accurate but it is possible that an error may occur. If we discover an error in pricing of the goods in your order we will inform you as soon as possible using the contact details you supply us and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.
(If we are unable to reach you we will treat the order as cancelled).
In the event of an order being cancelled, any payment already made for the goods will be refunded in full.If you transact with us in a currency that is not your local currency, then your credit card company should exchange
the amount charged to the currency of your country at the current rate. Please note that refunds will be carried out in the same currency as the original charge, and ".$ROSE_BRAND." cannot be held responsible for any loss due to exchange rate fluctuations.Non-EU customers are responsible for Import Duty/Tax in their respective countries.
Unfortunately we cannot advise you what these costs will be - please consult your local customs office for more information.
Availability
All offers are available while stocks last. If we are unable to supply a particular item which you have ordered or if the correct price for an item is different from the price on your order, we will notify you as soon as we can after receiving your order. If this happens, you may cancel your order and we will refund you any money which you may have already paid.
Delivery
Our postage and packing charges cover delivery to destinations within the UK and Europe, but please contact
us for pricing outside of Europe.
Under our standard service we aim to deliver goods to destinations in the UK within 3-10 working days
in most circumstances.
You will be advised of actual delivery time in our email of confirmation. Please check product pages for any special delivery information relating to specific products.
Standard delivery is via Royal Mail 1st Class Recorded. This service requires a signature, so please specify a delivery address where you will be able to sign for your goods.
If you choose our Next Working Day or Saturday Delivery services, delivery may be made via Royal Mail or via our
courier partners which include ANC. These services require a signature, so please specify a delivery address where you will be able to sign for your goods.
We will make every effort to deliver within the time stated on our Website but we will not be liable for any loss caused to you by late delivery.
If the goods are not delivered within the delivery time which we quote for that item, please contact us. We will try and ensure that you receive your order as quickly as possible, or if you wish you may cancel your order and we will refund you any money which you have paid.
Delivery outside the EU may be subject to local import taxes, which are your responsibility where they apply.
If so, the shipping company should advise you the charges due or else you should consult your local customs office.
Unfortunately we cannot advise you what these charges will be and Tiffany Rose is not responsible for them.
Please Order from Tiffany Rose with enough time to prevent any loss or disappointment resulting from the
delivery time as Tiffany Rose cannot be responsible for this.
