You may “opt-out” of certain marketing communications. Most of our marketing communications are sent by email and direct mail, though you may opt out of telephone calls, texting, and online behavioral advertising as well. You may also access or change your personal information or ask us to do so.
To do so yourself, you may:
Follow opt-out “unsubscribe” instructions in promotional e-mails we send to you.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
Security Methods
We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information in our possession. However, no website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof”. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.
E-mail Safety
An e-mail scam known as “phishing” is designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it came from us and it asks you for your personal information (including financial or payment card information,) do not respond to it. We will never request any financial information or other personal information from you through e-mail.
Children’s Personal Information
We recognize the special importance of protecting privacy where children are concerned. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children 13 years of age or younger.
