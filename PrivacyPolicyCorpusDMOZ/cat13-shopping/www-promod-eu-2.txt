Article 4: Payment
You can pay online via credit card.
We accept payment via Visa, Mastercard and Carte Bleue.
In the interests of secure payment, the Promod website uses the Sogenactif online payment service. This service incorporates the SSL security standard. The confidential data (16 digit credit card number, expiry date) is encrypted (encoded) and transmitted to the Sogenactif server but is not transmitted to our server.
When you confirm your order:
Your payment application is routed real-time Sogenactif’s secure electronic payment management system.
This sends an authorisation request to the credit card network.
The electronic payment manager delivers an electronic certificate.
The occurrence of non-payment due to the fraudulent use of a credit card will lead to the registration of the details associated with your order in a data file created. An incorrect statement or anomaly could also lead to individual processing procedures.
The account is not debited with the amount until the goods ordered have been dispatched.
If your items are no longer in stock, the amount of the cancelled articles will be duly deducted from the total debited amount and your account will be re-credited with the appropriate amount within 3 working days after our debit of the total amount that included the cancelled articles.
For gift orders, the invoice will be sent directly to the purchaser’s email address. The delivery note and the return form that will be inserted into the parcel, does not include any prices and payment details.

Article 5: Credit card anti-fraud actions
The data gathered by Promod on the website is intended for Promod. You can give or refuse your consent to the data gathered via this order being used in connection with the Promod customer files and likewise to it being used by third parties.
In accordance with the law No. 78-17 of the 6 01 1978 (informatique et libertés), you have a right at all times to access and amend personal information. This right of correction can be exercised online, or you can direct a request by email to the following address: service@promod.eu
When you place an order for the first time, you are allocated a password that you can change. The password you choose should contain at least 6 characters. You will be able to use it for every new order without having to enter all your details, apart from your credit card details which must be entered every time you order. It will also enable you to check any orders you have ongoing.
If you like, you can opt to be informed by email of any special deals on the website. This option can be chosen online.
You can ask to be removed from the customer files. This choice can be exercised online and will take effect once you no longer have any orders going through.
Finally, if you don't wish to receive offers from other companies and organisations, just send an e-mail to the following address: service@promod.eu, indicating your surname, first name, address, e-mail, telephone and confidential code.
Conforming to the data protection act of 6th January 1978, you have the right to access, modify or challenge your personal data information by writing, with proof of your identity, to service@promod.eu.
Promod reserves the right to check personal information provided by a customer and to take necessary follow-up action (such as asking for further proof or cancelling the order) to be sure that the person whose bank account is debited is indeed the same person who requested the order and also to avoid any fraudulent use whatsoever of credit card information.

Article 6: Security on the website
In order to offer secure payment, the Promod.eu site uses the secure payment services of Sogenactif. This service conforms to SSL secure online payment norms. Confidential information (the 16-figure credit card number, expiration date and card verification code) are transmitted in encrypted form on the SIPS server without ever passing through the Promod company's server.
After confirmation of the order, the payment request is routed real time in the secure automatic payment system of Sogenactif, where a request for payment authorisation is made to the credit card network. The automatic payment system then produces an electronic certificate.
For payment via Visa and MasterCard, Promod only accepts CES (Commerce Electronique Sécurisé) transactions with the international protocol 3D Secure, recognised by the method Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code. Commerce Electronique Sécurisé is an initiative to guarantee secure payments over the internet. By paying through a secure means, the system automatically checks that the credit card is active on the Commerce Electronique Sécurisé. Then a connection is made with the card issuing bank, requesting authorisation for payment with a personal authentication code. Payment only goes ahead if the issuing bank confirms the authentication code. Otherwise, the transaction is refused.
