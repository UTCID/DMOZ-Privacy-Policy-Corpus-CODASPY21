USE OF COOKIES
What is a cookie? A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your computer's hard drive to help our site recognize you when you return to our site. Cookies are used as a standard practice by many sites. An example of how we use this function could be if you started to place items in your shopping cart, but then for some reason had to leave our site or shut off your computer. When you return to our site, the cookie would enable our site to recognize that you have returned and all the items you placed in your cart during an earlier session would still be in your shopping cart.

COLORS
We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear at the Site. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
NETWORK ADVERTISING
We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please click here.
We may from time to time contract with third-party vendors to work on our behalf to provide ads to our customers via the Internet or to send direct mail or catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. In order to do so, these third parties may collect information concerning visitors to our websites using JavaScript software code and “cookies.” A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser or mobile device by websites, mobile apps, and advertisements that you access or use.  This “cookie” is stored on your computer or mobile device and helps websites and mobile apps to remember things about you to improve your experience with the website.  Our vendors may then connect the information that they collect from our website using “cookies” to other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for the purpose of sending you direct mail promotions. By using this site, you consent to these activities, including information collection by our vendors.  If you do not wish for cookies to be placed on your computer, most web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place. Additionally, information about opting out of cookie-based advertising can be found via the following links - http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ and https://www.neustar.biz/privacy/opt-out.  However, please keep in mind that cookies and similar technologies are an important part of how the website works; removing, rejecting, or limiting the use of cookies or other similar technologies might affect the availability and functionality of the website. To opt-out of receiving our direct mail or catalogs, you may send us an email at johnstonmurphy@johnstonmurphy.com or call us at 800.424.2854. We will honor those requests, but please understand that it may take 45 days for such mailings to end.
LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES
This Site may contain links to outside services and resources, the availability and content of which Genesco does not control. Any concerns regarding any such service or resource, or any link thereto, should be directed to the particular outside service or resource. The privacy policy, terms of use and other conditions of access specified on or applicable to any third party site will govern access and use of such site, the site owner's use of information obtained from users, etc.
SECURITY
Protecting your information is extremely important to us. We realize that prioritizing this issue will insure an exceptional shopping experience. To this end, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts all personal information including your credit card number, name, and address. With encryption in place, only Genesco can decode your information.
You can insure your connection is secure by looking in the lower left-hand corner of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and your connection is secure. Please note that SSL will not activate until you enter the login page after you have completed your shopping and are ready to check out.
You may also check your security level by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from 'http' to 'https.'
Please note that some versions of browsers don't permit communication even if the server is secure. This is also true of some firewalls. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server or would rather place your order by phone, please call us at 800-424-2854. Orders may also be faxed to 800-654-2371.
