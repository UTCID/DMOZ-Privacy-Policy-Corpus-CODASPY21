The Agreement (Contract) Between You and Us
After you place your order we email you a summary of your order.
We charge your payment card, Paypal or Gift Card with the total cost of the items we're sending you and any delivery fees.
The contract between us is only created once we send you the products you ordered, and not before. It means we have accepted your offer and fully communicated this to you.
You
may cancel any order prior to the point at which we email you to confirm dispatch of your order (in certain circumstances your right to cancel continues until 30 Calendar days after the day of delivery). See Cancelling Orders below
Though we check our system frequently to try to avoid errors, things can occasionally go wrong with the ordering process. If we make a mistake we will do our best to put things right as quickly as we can, with as little inconvenience to you as possible. We do however reserve the right to cancel any order for any reason at any time prior to dispatch, for example (but not limited to) where there is an obvious material mistake in the price or product information.
All orders are made subject to these terms and conditions. Please refer to “Magazine Subscriptions Terms and Conditions” in relation to any magazine subscription ordered.

Your Privacy When You Shop Online with Us
We want you to be able to shop with confidence on our site, which is why we take the privacy of your personal information very seriously.
When you shop with us, you give us certain personal details, such as your name, email address and payment address. We hold such information securely using SSL encryption software. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer which is the industry standard security technology for keeping data private during online transactions. This means your personal information cannot be read by anyone who should not see it.
You will notice the web address (URL) is https when you go through to the WHSmith.co.uk checkout. This shows that the site is using SSL and your details are protected.
We comply with all applicable data protection legislation, and we treat all your personal information as confidential. We are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that provides a safe online experience.
To process your order efficiently, reputable third-party banking and distribution institutions handle the credit and debit card transactions and order fulfilment. They receive the information needed to verify and authorise your payment card and to process your order. These organisations are under strict legal and contractual obligations to keep your personal information private.
We do not require you to create an account to shop with us. New customers have the option to create an account by adding a password after they have checked out.

Many web browsers allow users to control most cookies through their browser settings. However doing so will prevent the checkout from working and you will not be able to place orders.

Availability of Products
We update our availability information regularly but occasionally a product may run out between updates.
We do our best to dispatch your products within the lead time shown on the product page when you order. If this is not possible, your order will be sent out as soon as the goods become available. If
we can't supply your order within 30 days, we will cancel the order - except for products that have not been published or released yet.
The dispatch and delivery times shown are approximate and delays can sometimes occur. Delivery times are based on Working days (Monday-Friday, excluding Public Holidays).
We will email you as soon as your order is ready to be dispatched.
Back to top
Age Restrictions
You must be over 18 to use WHSmith.co.uk. By placing an order you confirm that you are at least 18 and legally capable of entering into a binding contract.
When you place an order this means you are aware of any age restrictions on the products and agree that you are old enough to buy them.
For products which require age verification before purchase, our system will run a check using the customer's name and date of birth, or their credit card or PayPal account, to confirm that they are above the legal age to buy them. WHSmith cannot sell age verified items to any customers who fail this check.
Back to top
Delivery Restrictions
Certain products are subject to delivery restrictions. You will find details of any delivery restriction displayed on the product page. We can only send products to UK addresses.
PO Box addresses: in some instances we may not be able to deliver parcels to PO Box address - we will let you know if there is an issue.

Prices and VAT
Prices may vary from WHSmith stores; the prices you see online are only valid on the website, not in our stores.
Prices shown on this site include VAT, where and to the extent that VAT is required to be applied to the product under UK VAT law.
Delivery charges are extra. See full details of delivery charges
We make every effort to ensure the prices on our website are correct but we can sometimes make a mistake. If we notice a material price mistake before we dispatch something you have ordered, we will ask if you want to pay the correct price or cancel your order. If we do not hear from you, we will cancel your order.
We reserve the right to change prices listed without notice. All orders for products are subject to availability. We reserve the right to refuse to supply to any individual or company.
Back to top
Promotions and Discounts
All promotions are subject to availability. Prices and promotions change a lot online. We will always charge you the price we gave you when you placed your order, even if a promotion is subsequently withdrawn.
Book and magazine discounts are taken off the recommended retail price or cover price (RRP).
Stationery, gifts, games, toys, computing and electronics discounts are taken off the previous selling price
To qualify for a multi-buy discount, e.g. buy 3 for the price of 2, you need to select the right number of products. If not, you will be charged the normal price.
The extra discount will be applied automatically to your total basket price (the cheapest item will be discounted/free). You cannot cancel a single item that you bought as part of a multi-buy promotion - you need to cancel all of the promoted products.
Back to top
Payment Details
All product prices and delivery charges are shown in UK pounds sterling.
We accept payment by Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Paypal, Laybuy and WHSmith Gift Cards.
We charge for all the items and delivery fees when you place your order.
Credit and Debit Cards we accept are Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Maestro, Delta and JCB.
On rare occasions when we go to pick your item(s) we may find that it is damaged or we do not have the item in stock. In these circumstances, we will have charged your credit / debit card expecting to dispatch your item(s). Therefore, we will refund the order and re-order the item(s) on your behalf. Your statement will show a charge and refund in short succession. We will then charge your card when the item(s) comes back into stock and we are ready to dispatch it.
Our system can hold several payment cards per account. Your order will be charged to the payment card that you assigned to it.
If we are unable to fulfill the order we will refund you to the payment type you used.
Back to top
Cancelling Orders
You can cancel WHSmith orders under 3 different circumstances:
1. Cancellation before we have instructed our warehouse to pick the item(s) and send them to you
You can cancel any order for any reason if your cancellation reaches us before we have emailed you confirmation that the products have been dispatched.
If you have a WHSmith account, you can cancel your order online by following these steps:
1. Login to My Account
2. Go to My Orders
3. Click the View button next to the order
4. Click Modify this Order
5. Either click 'Cancel Entire Order' or if you wish to cancel a product(s) within an order amend the number of each item you would like to receive and click Update Order
- If your order has progressed to a point where it cannot be cancelled you will not be shown this option. See option 2 below for returns once you’ve received the items.
- If your order was for a multi-buy (eg. Buy One Get One Free, £5 when you spend £20) you can only cancel all the items in the promotion. If an item has been dispatched the other items cannot be cancelled. See option 2 below for returns once you’ve received the items.
6. We will email you to confirm that we have cancelled your order.
If you do not have a WHSmith account, you will need to contact our Customer Services Team to request a cancellation.
For Same Day Click & Collect orders, you can only cancel your order by visiting the store or waiting for auto-cancellation after 10 days of non-collection.
2. Your legal '14 day cooling off period' cancellation rights
UK consumers and consumers from the rest of the European Union have the right to cancel contracts for the purchase of items within fourteen (14) calendar days of the day after receipt of the ordered goods. We offer an extended cooling off period of 30 calendar days after receipt of the ordered goods.
This policy does not apply to the following goods, which are exempt from the right to cancel:
Periodical(s) or magazine(s)
Magazine Gift Packs or Experience Gift Packs which have been activated.
Digital products such as CDs, DVDs, or computer software where the holographic seal and/or shrink-wrap has been unsealed.
Products made to your specification i.e. personalised
Perishable goods
Digital downloads, including e-gift cards
You can cancel your contract at any time up to 30 calendar days, starting the day after delivery. To do this, please return your item(s) to us by post or to a WHSmith highstreet store. Unwanted products should preferably be returned in their original packaging or otherwise adequately packaged, and returned as soon as reasonably practicable.
Return to store: Return the item to a WHSmith High Street store along with the email we sent you when we dispatched it. Refunds are only made onto the card that made the original payment, not in cash. PayPal payments are refunded to your payment card. Items paid for by Laybuy cannot be returned to store.
Return by post: The return is at your own risk and at your own cost and we will not refund your costs in returning the item to us and other services provided to you in connection with the purchase such as recorded or courier delivery. Include the reason for the return, your order number and your email address or telephone number. We may withhold refund until the item(s) are returned (or evidence of return is provided by you). Same Day Click & Collect orders cannot be returned by post.
To return items over 1m long, arrange collection: If you wish to return an item over 1m long please contact us to arrange collection.
If you fail to return the goods, we are entitled to collect them, and charge you the direct cost of collection. If you fail to take reasonable care of the goods before they are returned to us, and this results in damage or deterioration, we will charge you for the reduction in value.
This cancellation policy does not affect your legal rights - for example, if goods are faulty or misdescribed.
3. Faulty or misdescribed goods
You should inspect any product(s) you purchase from the website as soon as you can after delivery and notify us if you consider they are defective as soon as possible. If a product is incorrect, faulty or defective you are entitled to either:
During the first 30 days after the delivery date
ask us to reimburse the price paid for the relevant product(s) to the credit, or debit or gift card used to purchase the goods.
During the first 6 months after the delivery date:
ask us to repair the product(s) at our own expense;
ask us to supply replacement product(s) free of charge
If you are sending something back that's faulty or incorrect due to our error, we will refund the return postage costs to your payment card, but not in other circumstances.
If the item is not working, refer to any warranty information relating to it. It may be quicker for you to get a replacement product direct from the manufacturer rather than by returning it to us.
You have statutory rights against us and any warranty applicable to an item is additional to those rights. You can also obtain free legal advice on your statutory rights in relation to faulty or misdescribed goods from Trading Standards (via Citizens advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506) or your local Citizens Advice Bureau. Our Customer Service Team will also be able to advise you - call them on 0333 6005000 or fill out our Contact Form.
You are also entitled to settle any dispute through the online resolution platform
Anything bought from a partner site must be returned according to their terms and conditions.
Same Day Click & Collect orders can only be cancelled in store. Alternatively, you can wait for an auto-cancellation after 10 days of non-collection.

Gift Experience Terms and Conditions
Please read this section carefully before purchasing your activity gift voucher. These terms and conditions form the basis of a contract between Activity Superstore, and you (the purchaser and/or any subsequent holder of the activity gift voucher). If you have an issue with an Experience Gift please contact our Customer Service team by phone on 0333 6005000 or email them.
Terms and conditions
Vouchers are valid for a minimum of nine months (excluding promotions). Please check the season of any intended activity, as this may be shorter than the Voucher validity. You will find the expiry date printed on the Voucher. You must book and complete your activity prior to the expiry date. If you are unable to use your Voucher within the validity period, the Voucher can be extended for a period of up to six months (excluding promotions). A Voucher can only be extended once and must be done while the voucher is valid. Extended Vouchers cannot be refunded. A £20 administration fee is payable if you choose to extend your validity. Promotional vouchers cannot be extended.
Choosing your activity
You may use your Voucher to book any of the activities from our website. If you have not already been provided with a Voucher for the type of activity you are interested in, or wish to change to another activity type, contact us on the number provided or via our website and you will be sent a Voucher for that activity. If appropriate, your original Voucher will be replaced. Contact us again when you have decided which activity you wish to enjoy. A difference will be payable if the chosen activity costs more than the face value of your original Voucher and the value of your Voucher will be increased. If your chosen activity is cheaper, Activity Superstore will hold the difference as a credit against another activity. In this case, the credit holds the same expiry date as the original Voucher. Please note you may not be able to change your mind once a date has been booked with a supplier.
Exchanging your Voucher
A Voucher can be exchanged only once for another Voucher, up to the face value stated on it and subject to the restrictions below , without incurring a fee. An administration fee of £20 will be charged for a second and final exchange, (as no more than two exchanges in total are permitted). If you wish to combine or merge more than one Voucher together, as part of the exchange process, then this can be arranged however subject to the following restrictions; You can merge no more than two Vouchers together; if the Vouchers have different expiry dates then the earlier expiry date is taken forward onto the replacement Voucher, not the later date; only Vouchers purchased from the same retail chain or website may be merged together; and you may not merge any Vouchers previously merged or exchanged. Please note Activity Superstore promotional products, tangible gift products and Fresh Weekend products are excluded from the list of exchangeable products.
Bookings
In order to enjoy your chosen activity and to arrange a time and place for your activity, you can choose the particular provider of the activity that you are interested in, phone us, the provider or book via our website. You may be required to send your Voucher to the chosen provider to confirm your booking in advance: if so Activity Superstore recommends you keep a record of your Voucher number and use registered post, as your Voucher is a valuable document. Customers should also note that your Voucher must be presented on the day, in order to participate in the activity. If lost, Activity Superstore regrets that Vouchers cannot be replaced. Please note you may not be able to change your mind once a date has been booked with a supplier.
Description and photography
Activity Superstore have tried hard to ensure that descriptions, illustrations and experience titles used in the Voucher packs, in all our literature and our website are accurate, however, photographs and experience titles are intended to give a general idea of the activity described, and do not form part of any contract between you and Activity Superstore. Please note depending on the location you choose the experience title may differ to that of experience title used by our suppliers, but this does not effect your entitlement as described in your Voucher pack.
Insurance
Where applicable, the price of the Voucher includes the cost of providing you with personal accident insurance cover to participants up to 75 years old. This insurance cover is only included if indicated on your Voucher and is not available for activities that take place abroad. Full details of insurance cover are available on request.
Refunds
If you are not satisfied with your Voucher pack, please call us within 28 days of purchase and (on behalf of Activity Superstore) we will happily arrange a full refund on receipt of your Voucher. Refunds will be paid back onto the credit/debit card used to place the original order, or by cheque. No interest will be paid on the amount to be refunded. Refunds cannot be issued once a date has been booked with the provider.
Activity Cheques
Activity Cheques can be redeemed for any activity or gift from our website excluding overseas activities. A difference will be payable if the chosen activity costs more than the face value of your activity cheque. If your chosen activity is cheaper, Activity Superstore will hold the difference as a credit against another activity. In this case the credit holds the same expiry date as the original activity cheque.
