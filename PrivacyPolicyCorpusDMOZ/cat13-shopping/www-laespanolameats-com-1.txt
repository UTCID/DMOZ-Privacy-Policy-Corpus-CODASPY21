DOÑA JUANA SAUSAGES MADE IN USA
La Española Meats has been making Spanish style artisanal charcuterie in California since 1982.

Authentic recipes, superior ingredients and personal attention to each batch sets us apart from others. You are sure to enjoy the best flavors of Spain in our chorizos, morcillas, salchichones and lomos made right here in the USA!

La Española Meats
La Española Meats was founded in 1982 by Juana Gimeno Faraone, it started as a small family business dedicated to importing Spanish products. We have been importing Spanish products since 1983 thanks to our founder Doña Juana, who, not being able to find these products here in the US, decided to create her own company to bring them and also make Spanish-style sausages here with her own brand called Doña Juana and In this way, we can bring to the Spanish community living in the United States a little piece of their homeland.
