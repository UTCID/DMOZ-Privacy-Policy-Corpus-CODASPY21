Return Policy
Easy, No Hassle Return Policy
We accept any returns up to 90 days from the date of delivery, for items that are new and still in their sealed packaging. If an item has been opened, we can not accept it for a return. Sorry, but this is due to the hygienic nature of our products. However, you may return any unopened packages within a case.
If item(s) is being returned because of no fault of LL Medico, then return shipping cost is to be paid by the customer. Please contact us first because we can usually get much better shipping rates and then deduct the cost from your return.
If LL Medico is at fault, we will happily pay the return shipping fee.
Please note a 25% restocking fee may be applied for larger bulk items such as wheelchairs, commodes and walkers etc.  Please contact us for the price of the restocking fee or for any other questions regarding a return you may have.
For cancellations before shipment, a fee of 2.3% + .30 will be deducted from your refund due to our credit card processor charging those fees and not returning them.
After we receive your returned item(s), we can either refund you for the cost of the product(s) or you may request an exchange. Sorry but we do not refund any original shipping charges.
Please contact us at sales@llmedico.com or give us a call at (855) 422-4556 to request a return authorization or use the "Return Items?" link under your orders in your account. Please do not send items back until your return request has been authorized.
