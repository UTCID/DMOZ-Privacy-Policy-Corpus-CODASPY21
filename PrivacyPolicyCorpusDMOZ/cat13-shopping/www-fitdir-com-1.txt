Great service! Great price! Great product! I ordered the machine (Kettler Favorit rower) Thursday afternoon and it arrived only two days later, on Saturday. This was even faster than promised, which was still faster than anyone else. I also got a great price for the machine, much lower than elsewhere. The machine itself is also great so far. It really simulates actual rowing, which no other rower in its price range does. Michael Schultz, Los Angeles, California

I am very happy with my bike I purchased in December. I've been using it everyday for an hour since December 16th and I have already seen a big difference in my muscle tone and everything fits me better. I am so happy I finally went for the purchase; I should have done it years ago. It is worth every penny to feel so good about you. Andy was very helpful and pleasant when I called and I thought it was shipped out fast. I received my bike in one week and I can't say enough about how nice this machine is. Thank you so much.

We purchased from Fitnessdirtect a WaterRower and the quality of the machine is outstanding. The machine is quiet and is a significant improvement over some of those noisy dust collectors. That assessment is based on 41 years of rowing in all types of boats and rowing machines. If you are looking for a great place to do business with then contact Fitnessdirect. They are courteous, reliable and very helpful. Combined with the great service and quality is the best price around.

Greetings, I am writing to congratulate you on your outstanding customer service. The item I purchased (sit up board) was back ordered so the transaction involved a number of communications between myself and your staff. Your company receives a 100% AAA+++ in this area. I was kept well informed by members of your staff regarding the status of my order and their friendly, prompt and courteous service is unparalleled. Having sold BMW and Mercedes automobiles for 15 years I recognize quality customer care when I see it. This was truly an extraordinary buying experience and it was your people who made it such. Lastly the product is exactly as promised and I could not be more pleased with every aspect of this transaction. Best Wishes, The purpose of life is to serve and to show compassion and the will to help others. Only then have we ourselves become true human beings.

Just letting you know how satisfied I am with the product and service....the order actually arrived BEFORE I received my shipping confirmation number. As far as the ab machine....SUPER!!! I've been working out for 20 plus years and have been finding it more and more difficult to get up and down from the floor (no kidding) when doing my ab workout (I'll be 52 in March). Not only does the ab leverage machine conquer my up and down problem, but it really blasts my abs. GREAT PRODUCT!! I'll be shopping you guys again.

Two points. One. From the time I first made an inquiry about buying a treadmill for my daughter through the delivery problems (see below) Andy Grenz was absolutely terrific! He always responded promptly, was most helpful in resolving any issues, and couldn't have been more user friendly. Second. The delivery service in Dallas was not particularly helpful in trying to find a convenient time for the delivery (it required intervention by Andy) and on the delivery date, they were two hours later than the scheduled time.

Hi Andy, Just a quick note to let you know that I received my Kettler Condor elliptical Trainer today. You were right; this is one heavy duty and easy to use machine.It is just what I was looking for. Thank you for taking the time to hear my entire Elliptical trainer needs and for pointing me in the right direction. Also, the people at Conway Express are great to deal with, they even gave me a heads-up on the delivery time so that I could make myself available.

You can imagine my uncertainty........The Ab board was my first eBaypurchase, your help on and off the website made me feel more at ease knowing that there was a real person on the other end of the email address.

Andy and Victor, Thanks to for making the transaction go so well. I felt like my business was appreciated, which isn't as common as you would think in today’s environment with all the competition. I received my Kettler spinning bike and elliptical cross trainer. I considered getting only the bike, but you gave me a price that included shipping and swayed me to get both at once. They are both very high quality pieces of equipment and operate super smooth. Directions included made for quick and easy assembly. I'm looking forward to years of indoor fitness from my equipment. I would recommend doing business with Fitness Direct to anyone that wants to buy quality training equipment from people that are great to work with. I'm glad I followed your advice and had help to my merchandise. With the extra built in crating for the elliptical, the boxes were heavy and bulky.

Thanks for the quick shipment and great value on the fitness equipment. I had been searching the internet for a VKR/chin/dip station. I saw the same piece on fitnessfactory.com but it was more than I wanted to pay after you figure in shipping. I had bought a home gym free weight rack system from fitnessfactory.com and I knew they sold nice, solid equipment. So I was very surprised when my equipment arrived and was shipped directly from fitness factory in Chicago. It was exactly the same thing they are selling on their website but considerably less expensive from you guys. I don't know how you worked that out but hey, I don't really care. I got a nice, solid piece of equipment for a great value, so thanks.

Hi Victor, Got my Powerline Roman Chair much faster than I figured. I've put it together and have used it already. The packing, quality of the item, and simplicity of assembly impressed me. Thanksalot,

It was a long and complicated journey sending my new Kettler Coach Rowerfrom San Diego to my home on Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada. Andy Grenz provided outstanding customer service and was at all times friendly and accommodating. It has arrived safely and I am delighted with its performance. Many thanks for your professional service and follow-up!

Thanks Andy for the fast and courteous service. From the first quote request I was hooked. Even though the stepper I inquired about was out of stock, Andy offered me a higher priced model for the same price. He answered my questions on the phone, and assured me about the shipping process, which was so fast that it is within 2 days of ordering. They had just opened a fitness superstore in my neighborhood, but I never even stepped foot into it, because my stepper was delivered to my driveway by Best Overnight Express who helped roll it into the garage. I assembled it in a few hours, with the "help" of my 4 year old, and had my first workout that evening. The Diamondback stepper gives me a better workout than the one at the fitness center I'm a member of, and I have a feeling that I won't be going back there too often. I am truly satisfied and will visit your store the next time I'm in San Diego to see what else I'd like to try

Once again I would like to thank you for helping me work through the comparison of the life core S series model 1050RBs and the Spirit RBs95 model recumbent bikes. You spent a valuable amount of time discussing the relative merits of both units
and with further research, I found the Spirit was a far better value for my family and me. I could have never reached my decision without your expertise, for which I shall always be grateful to you!!!
Sincerely yours,
