Disclaimer
We're very sorry when this happens. Our intention is to have accurate descriptions that represent the items offered. Sometimes the problem comes from a mistake in data entry. Other times, the manufacturer has changed the product and we were not notified or data from our suppliers may not be 100% accurate. We do our best to have everything correct, but there are too many items to make any guarantees. As with every other catalog and online publication, we are not responsible for typographical errors. If you become aware of this situation we would appreciate you notifying us.
When an error is found, we will do what we can to correct the situation. There are times when products are not available or the item description is completely wrong and the only option is to apologize and refund your money. Manufacturers make changes in production and discontinue items. Certain items may not be available regardless of how badly you would like it to be so. We regret any errors on the website and thank you for your understanding if one is encountered.
