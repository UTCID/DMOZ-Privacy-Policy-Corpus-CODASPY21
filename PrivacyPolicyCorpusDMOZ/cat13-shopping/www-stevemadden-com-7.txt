SM Ambassadors Terms and Conditions
This Affiliate Agreement (the "Agreement") contains the complete terms and conditions between Steven Madden, Ltd. ("us", "we" or "Steve Madden") and you, regarding your application to and participation in the Steve Madden Affiliate Program (the "Program") as an affiliate of Steve Madden ("you" or "Affiliate"), and the establishment of links from Affiliate's social media accounts to our website, www.SteveMadden.com (the "Madden Site").
BY SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION TO JOIN OR BY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Eligibility to Participate in the Program
To participate in the Program, you must be a legal resident of the fifty (50) United States and at least eighteen (18) years of age or older (or the age of majority, whichever is greater) in your state of legal residence. Employees of Steve Madden and/or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or related companies are not eligible to participate.
2. Definitions
"Affiliate" shall mean the individual applying to or participating in the Program by displaying Steve Madden's products on the social media accounts owned or controlled by Affiliate, including but not limited to, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or blog (individually and collectively, "Affiliate's Social Platform"), using an affiliate tracking link (the "Link" defined below) in exchange for receiving a commission from Steve Madden for sales directly resulting from such display.
"Commission Fees" shall mean the amount Affiliate will be paid for each Qualified Purchase by a Referred Customer that Affiliate refers to Steve Madden, subject to the Commission Threshold, if any, and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
"Commission Threshold" shall mean the amount of Commission Fees that an Affiliate may have to first accrue prior to receiving a payment from Steve Madden, as may be determined by Steve Madden at any time in its discretion.
"Link" shall mean a unique tracking link provided by Madden to Affiliate for Affiliate's use and posting on Affiliate's Social Platform in connection with a Post.
"Post" shall mean a post, story, tweet, video or blog, as applicable, made by Affiliate on Affiliate's Social Platform, showing Affiliate wearing Product and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
"Product" shall mean product available for purchase from the Madden Site. Affiliate is solely responsible for acquiring (by purchase, borrow or otherwise) any such Product; however, from time to time, Steve Madden may gift Product to Affiliate as determined in its sole discretion.
"Qualified Purchase" shall mean a sale of Steve Madden's Product(s) to a Referred Customer, excluding any Product that is specifically designated as a sale, discounted or clearance item. For sake of clarity, a Qualified Purchase shall only include a sale of Product to a Referred Customer at its full retail price or subject to a discount code or price reduction that is applicable to all or a general category of items on the Madden Site (as opposed to a discount code or price reduction applicable to a specific Product, which is excluded from this definition of a Qualified Purchase).
"Referred Customer" shall mean each new and unique customer referred to the Madden Site from Affiliate through a Link, that provides valid account and billing information and completes a Qualified Purchase.
3. Enrollment in the Program
(a) To begin the enrollment process, Affiliate must submit a completed Program application through the Madden Site.
(b) We will evaluate your application and notify you in a timely manner if the application is accepted or rejected. We may reject Affiliate's application for any reason, in our sole discretion, including if we determine that Affiliate's Social Platform is unsuitable for the Program. Unsuitability includes, without limitation, illegal, offensive, infringing content or content that we otherwise deem offensive. If Affiliate is accepted into the Program, Affiliate shall notify Steve Madden in writing of any significant changes to the content or structure of Affiliate's Social Platform within five (5) days of such change(s).
(c) For sake of clarity, submitting an application does not guarantee your acceptance into the Program. Applicants accepted into the Program will be determined by Steve Madden solely in its discretion. If you are accepted into the Program, Steve Madden expressly reserves the right to suspend or terminate your participation as an Affiliate and/or deactivate your Link, for any or no reason, with or without cause, at any time in its discretion. In the event of any such suspension, termination or deactivation, you will be notified by us in writing. Steve Madden further expressly reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Program, and/or modify its Terms and Conditions, in whole or in part, at any time in its discretion, for any or no reason, and without notice to Affiliate.
4. Links
Affiliate shall not modify the Link in any way. We will not be responsible for errors that occur in the tracking of transactions if Affiliate has made or caused any such modification.
5. Posts
(a) The Post: (i) must depict only Affiliate and no other person, unless such other person is at least eighteen (18) years of age or older (or the age of majority, whichever is greater) and a legal resident of the fifty (50) United States and Affiliate has obtained the consent of such person to be depicted in the Post (the "Permitted Third Party"); (ii) must depict Affiliate and/or the Permitted Third Party wearing Product(s); (iii) must tag @SteveMadden and must include the required hashtag #SMAmbassador in a clear and conspicuous manner (for example, in an Instagram Post, it must appear "above the fold" within the first three (3) lines of the post or superimposed in a story); (iv) may not mention, reference or show any brand other than Steve Madden; (v) must not defame, misrepresent or disparage Steve Madden, its business, products or brands, or any third party brands, products or services competitive to Steve Madden and/or its business, products or brands; (vi) must reflect Affiliate's actual, honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences with Steve Madden and its business and products and will not contain any statements or representations about Company or its business and products which are not true or that is misleading or deceptive; (vii) shall be Affiliate's own original work, created solely by Affiliate, and will not infringe the copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights of any person or entity; and (viii) shall not contain or reference content which is lewd, obscene, sexually explicit, pornographic, disparaging, defamatory, libelous, or otherwise illegal, offensive or inappropriate in any way.
(b) Affiliate represents, warrants and agrees that it shall abide by all of the foregoing, as well as all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the Federal Trade Commission's Endorsement Guides ("FTC Guides"), which require that material connections between advertisers and endorsers be disclosed, as well as the Community Guidelines, Terms of Use and other applicable policies of the social media platform used by Affiliate for its Post(s). We reserve the right to withhold Commission Fees and/or deactivate your Link and/or terminate your affiliate relationship with us if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are not in compliance with any of the foregoing, including but not limited to, your noncompliance with the FTC Guides and failure to clearly and conspicuously include the required hashtag #SMAmbassador as set forth above. Affiliate further represents and warrants that he/she has obtained any and all necessary consents of any Permitted Third Party.
6. Order Processing
Steve Madden will process orders placed by Referred Customers who follow the Link from Affiliate's Social Platform to the Madden Site. We reserve the right, in our discretion, to reject orders that do not comply with certain requirements that we may establish from time to time. All aspects of order processing and fulfillment, including Steve Madden's cancellation, processing, refunds, customer service and payment processing, will be our responsibility. We will track the Qualified Purchases generated by your Affiliate Link, at our discretion either directly or via a third party vendor, and will make this information available to you through the Madden Site. To permit accurate tracking, reporting and commission accrual, you must ensure that the Link between Affiliate's Social Platform accounts and the Madden Site are properly formatted. We shall not be responsible for improperly formatted Links.
7. Commission Fee Determination; Qualified Purchases
(a) We will pay Affiliate a Commission Fee based on the number of Qualified Purchases generated by the Link on Affiliate's Social Platform.
(b) The Commission Fee amount and structure shall be determined by the method of payment selected by Affiliate in its Program application. If Affiliate selected payment through PayPal, the Commission Fee shall be in an amount equal to five percent (5%) for each Qualified Purchase, unless otherwise agreed between the parties in writing, based upon net sales. "Net sales" shall mean the actual purchase price paid by a Referred Customer for a Qualified Purchase, less deductions for customer shipping and handling fees, credit card processing fees, returns and sales tax, if any. If Affiliate selected payment by discount code, for each Qualified Purchase, Affiliate will receive a discount code in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Qualified Purchase, which discount code is valid towards a purchase made by Affiliate on the Madden Site. Code is not valid towards prior purchases.
(c) A "Qualified Purchase" will not include: (i) a purchase by a Referred Customer that is subject to a refund; (ii) a purchase that was completed prior to the Affiliate joining the Program or was not tracked properly through an Affiliate Link; (iii) a purchase that Steve Madden suspects, in its sole discretion, is the result of fraud, which shall include but is not limited to, the use of software that generates real and fictitious information, multiple accounts from the same customer, or the referral of accounts that do not comply with this Agreement; (iv) a purchase made by Affiliate through its own Affiliate Link; or (v) a purchase by a Referred Customer if the Referred Customer was offered or received coupons, refunds, credits or discounts from the Affiliate.
(d) We reserve the right to withhold payment of Commission Fees to an Affiliate who has commissions that are potentially fraudulent as determined by us in our sole discretion, to determine the legitimacy of the Referred Customers.
(e) We reserve the right to suspend the payment of Commission Fees at any time and indefinitely, if we suspect fraud or other improper activity or a potential breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the Affiliate or a Referred Customer. We reserve the right to deduct from Affiliate's current and future Commission Fees any and all Commission Fees corresponding to any fraudulent, questionable or cancelled purchases.
(f) We reserve the right to immediately cancel or withhold for later review any Commission Fee that fails to meet the criteria of a "Qualified Purchase".
(g) Any attempt by Affiliate to manipulate, falsify or inflate Referred Customers, Qualified Purchases or Commission Fees to intentionally defraud Steve Madden or any violation of the terms of this Agreement constitutes immediate grounds for us to terminate your participation in the Program and will result in the forfeiture of any Commission Fees due to the Affiliate.
8. Accrual and Payment of Commission Fees
(a) As may be determined by Steve Madden at any time in its discretion, Commission Fees may not be rendered to Affiliate for amounts less than $50.00 USD (the "Commission Threshold"). In the event that Steve Madden determines to apply a Commission Threshold, any Commission Fees earned by Affiliate that are less than the Commission Threshold will carry over into the next payment cycle. In such case, when your Commission Fees' total reaches $50.00 or more, you will be sent a payment pursuant to the terms of this Section, provided all Qualified Purchases associated therewith meet the conditions set forth in this Agreement. For sake of clarity, once you have qualified for a payment pursuant to the terms of this section and payment has been rendered, you will not be entitled to future payment of any Commission Fees unless and until you have again reached or exceeded the Commission Threshold each time. If you have not reached or exceeded the Commission Threshold in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, the Commission Fees earned by Affiliate during such period will no longer carry over into the next payment cycle, no payment will be made thereon and any such Commission Fees will be forfeited and reset to zero.
(b) Commission Fees will be paid sixty (60) days from the order date of the Qualified Purchase associated therewith, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(a) above.
(c) Payment of Commission Fees will be made through PayPal or by discount code to the Madden Site, depending upon the method of payment you selected in your Program application. We are not responsible for paying any third party fees charged by PayPal in order for you to receive your Commission Fees.
(d) We reserve the right, in our discretion, to change or modify the available commission payment methods or payment schedule at any time. You will be notified by us of any such changes, which shall take effect when posted on the Madden Site.
(e) Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that we may fulfill our payment obligations under this Agreement through a third party service or vendor.
(f) We do not make any guarantee of a minimum amount of Qualified Purchases or that Affiliate will earn any amount of Commission Fee under this Agreement.
9. Reports of Qualified Purchases
You may log into your affiliate console to review your click through and potential Qualified Purchases statistics on a daily basis. The potential Qualified Purchases shown in this report have not been reviewed to confirm they meet all criteria for Qualified Purchases and, as such, Commission Fees may not be issued for all Referred Customers that appear in the affiliate console. In the event that Affiliate disputes a Qualified Purchase and/or Commission Fee, Affiliate must file a written report of such dispute with Steve Madden by email within ten (10) days after the subject Commission Fee is made and/or would otherwise have been due. Affiliate's failure to file a timely dispute shall result in forfeiture of Affiliate's right to dispute the subject Commission Fee.
10. Policies and Pricing
Referred Customers who buy products through the Program will be deemed to be customers of Steve Madden. Accordingly, all Madden Site terms, policies, and procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product sales will apply to such customers with respect to their transactions at the Madden Site. We may change our terms, policies and procedures at any time consistent with applicable laws. Since prices and availability may vary from time to time, Affiliate may not display Steve Madden price information on Affiliate's Post. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to present current and accurate information, but cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.
11. Limited License for Use of Steve Madden logos/trademarks
We grant to Affiliate a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use and display the Links, to access the Madden Site through the Links and to use our trademark and logos solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and only during the Term of this Agreement.
12. Ownership
As between Affiliate and Steve Madden, Steve Madden shall own all right, title and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Madden Site, the Program and the Links. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Rights" means copyright rights, trademark rights, patent rights, trade secrets, moral rights, right of publicity, authors' rights, contract and licensing rights, goodwill and all other intellectual property rights as may exist now and/or hereafter come into existence and all renewals and extensions thereof, regardless of whether such rights arise under the laws of the United States or any other state, country or jurisdiction.
13. License to Use of Posts and Affiliate's Image
We agree that you shall retain ownership rights to your Posts and you hereby grant us the perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to publish, copy, re-post, link to or otherwise use your Posts, your Social Platform handle, your name, and your image and likeness as depicted in a Post, in whole or in part, for any purposes in our discretion, in any and all medium, without limitation, additional compensation, notice, review or approval.

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party prior written notice by email.
(b) Steve Madden expressly reserves all rights to terminate the Program, in whole or in part, at any time for any or no reason, as determined in its sole discretion, by giving Affiliate written notice by email.
(c) Upon termination of this Agreement, Affiliate shall promptly remove all Links and Program-related content from Affiliate's Social Platform. Affiliate is only eligible to earn Commission Fees on Qualified Purchases occurring during the Term (including all steps required for a transaction to be a Qualified Purchase under this Agreement. In the event that an overpayment is made by Steve Madden, Affiliate agrees to promptly remit such excess payment upon notification by Steve Madden. Steve Madden may withhold Affiliate's final payment for a reasonable time to ensure that the correct amount is paid. The definitions contained in this Agreement and Sections 12, 13, 15 and 18 through 22, shall survive the termination of this Agreement, along with any other provisions that by their express terms do, or by their nature should, survive.
17. Modification
We may modify this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion; provided that the change shall solely apply to events occurring after the date on which you accept and agree to such modifications unless you otherwise agree herein. Such modifications shall take effect when posted on the Madden Site. Modifications may include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of available Commission Fees, commission amounts or percentages, payment procedures, Commission Fee payment schedules, and Program rules. If any modification is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this agreement, in which event you shall be entitled to your rights under the unmodified Agreement prior to the date of the applicable modification. Your continued participation in the Program following our posting of any modification on our website will constitute binding acceptance of the change.

FURTHER, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO AFFILIATE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PROGRAM WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL COMMISSIONS PAID OR PAYABLE TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.
