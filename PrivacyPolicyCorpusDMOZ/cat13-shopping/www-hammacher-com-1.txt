When you place an order online at

The information you provide will be used to process your order and improve your shopping experience. Once you have placed an online order with us, we will verify with your credit card company that your credit card is valid and send you an email message that confirms your order was successfully received. We will also send you an e-mail once your order has been shipped.
We will periodically send to your street or e-mail address product news and updates that you may find of interest and we do sometimes share customer information with 3rd parties, which may include marketing partners, for commercial purposes.

Please include your full name, street address, and e-mail address with your correspondence, and tell us how we should restrict use of your information.
We may work with data providers to target advertising to you personally, through online and offline methods including email, display media and direct mail. This advertising may be directed to you because you visited or logged in to our website. When we generate this advertising, data we collect from you through online cookies and other technologies may be combined with other de-identified data (such as a hashed, non-readable email or postal address) in order to tailor ads to you based on your preferences and other information about you. To learn more about targeted advertising, these providers, or how you may opt out, please visit the DAA's consumer choice page at https://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

When you e-mail a message to a friend from Hammacher.com using the Add This functionality, your e-mail address and your friends are both required. This ensures that your friend will know that we have sent the e-mail message at your request. E-mails obtained for the "Tell a Friend" service are only used for this purpose, and then discarded.
Catalog Requests & E-mail Updates
When you request a Hammacher Schlemmer catalog at Hammacher.com or ask to receive e-mail updates, we request your name, address and e-mail address in order to complete your request. We will respect your privacy and use your information in the same way described above under "Placing an Order Online."
