Returns
You may return any unused and unaltered item(s) within 90 days for an exchange or a refund. Authorization
is not needed, however, a call to our Customer Service Department 800-969-7501 or Technical Support
Department may help you avoid an unnecessary return. Technical Support can be reached at the following
phone numbers:
Snowmobile: 320-358-3409
Harley: 320-358-1914
Metric: 320-358-1915
Off Road: 320-358-3831
Please do not return goods to us C.O.D. Instead, you may use our quick and easy return process. Simply
complete your Merchandise Return Form and enclose it with the items you wish to return in a secure
package, apply the Authorized Return Label (ARS Label) to the package and take the package to any
UPS Store®, Customer Center, Shipping Outlet, Drop Box or give it to any UPS driver. Keep the
tracking number strip located on the lower portion of the ARS/Return Label for reference when tracking
your package.
How to Properly Return an Item
Step 1
Take the item you'd like to return and securely place it into the original package.
Step 2
Fill out the merchandise return form on the invoice and enclose that into the package as well.
Step 3
With the package prepared to ship, apply the supplied *UPS ARS/return label onto the package.
Note: Keep the Tracking number portion of the label for reference. Also, be sure to fill out the
ARS return label with your name, address and ZIP code.
Step 4
Take the package to any UPS Store®, Customer Center, Shipping Outlet, Drop Box or give it to any UPS
driver.
Note: The UPS ARS/return label only applies to shipping addresses in the contiguous United States.
You pay nothing up-front. $7.99 will be deducted from your refund or exchange. No restocking charge applies
if returned within 90 days ($9.99 or 10% fee, whichever is higher, after 90 days). Items found to
be used/mounted will be refunded at a reduced amount or returned to the customer, at our discretion.
We will not accept returns on items that have been modified or altered in any way. You will be refunded
for your merchandise, we will not refund oversize fees, tire fees, or other shipping costs. For items
which include a manufacturer's warranty, please follow their instructions. If warranty information
was not included, you may check to see if warranty information is available by searching for the part
number and looking for the warranty tab.
If you choose not to use the supplied ARS label, please return items using your preferred shipping carrier.
You will not be charged the $7.99 ARS fee since postage will then be pre-paid. Send packages to:
Dennis Kirk
955 S Frandsen Ave
Rush City, MN 55069

Use the original carton and pack the merchandise securely. Clearly mark the outside of the carton ***CONTENTS
- RETURN GOODS OF U.S. ORIGIN***. Enclose the invoice with a brief explanation for the return/exchange.
Ship the package prepaid, we do not accept return merchandise shipped COD. A $9.99 or 10% restocking

Additional Shipping Fees:
Tire fees occur due to factors beyond our control. A $5.00 charge is added to certain
tires that are shipped (Fee does not apply to pickup store orders). Charges are clearly stated before
you are asked to complete your order.
Oversize fees If at time of checkout a ground shipping option is chosen, an oversize
item fee may be added if the item is over the standard size limit. For air and other shipping methods,
this fee is already included in the price. Charges (if any) are clearly stated before you are asked
to complete your order.
Shipping Options
Standard Shipping We pay for ground delivery on Orders over $89 to the contiguous
United States only. A $7.99 shipping charge is applied to orders under $89. Non-standard item fees
may apply. See oversize fee
