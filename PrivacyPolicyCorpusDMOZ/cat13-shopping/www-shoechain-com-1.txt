We will make efforts so that your information will not be provided to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) we obtain your consent, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out to the sharing of information; (iii) a service provided on our site requires the interaction with or is provided by a third party, by way of example processing of credit card; (iv) pursuant to legal process or law enforcement; (v) we find that your use of this site violates this Policy, Terms of Use, other usage guidelines or as deemed reasonably necessary by us to protect our legal rights and/or property; (vi) or this site is purchased by a third party whereby that third party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as we can as set forth in this Policy. In the event you choose to use links that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites.How do I edit or delete my account information?We provide you with the ability to edit the information in your user account information that you provided to us in registration by using your personal account page area. You may request deletion of your user account by contacting our webmaster. Content or other data that you may have provided to us and that is not contained within your user account, such as posts that may appear within our forums or guest book, may continue to remain on our site at our discretion even though your user account is deleted.

There may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of Data.How safe is it to register (purchase) online?Some would say it is safer to use your credit card on our site than it is to use it in more traditional ways, such as in retail stores or restaurants. We use third party services to process our credit card transactions and they use the most sophisticated security processes available today.What is SSL and how does it protect my privacy?The company that processes our transactions uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity- all to ensure secure transactions for our registrants. SSL is the industry standard security protocol to encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number. SSL creates a shared digital key which only lets the sender and the receiver of the transmission scramble or unscramble information. To everyone else, even the servers relaying the message, the SSL transmission is indecipherable. SSL encryption can only be broken by intercepting the encrypted message, recording it, and using a computer to try every possible combination until the key is cracked. Most keys range from 40 to 1,014 digits long...as you can imagine, the number of possible combinations can be into the billions and beyond! You can also click on our SSL logo for more information.Ok, so how about encryption?Encryption is based on the mathematical scrambling and unscrambling of messages. The type of encryption used assigns two keys - one is a public key and one is a private key. When you send us a message, you use our public key to encrypt your message. Once we receive your encrypted message, we use the private key to decode it. The same key cannot both encrypt and decrypt information. So, information encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key, and vice versa- ensuring the security of your information.I've heard a lot about Secure Sites. What does that mean?Before completing any transaction on a website, you should make sure it is a Secure Site. Being on a Secure Site means you are connected under the cloak of SSL security. You can tell if you are on a Secure Site if you see a padlock or key somewhere along the bottom of your browser's window. If the lock is closed or if the key is unbroken, you are dealing with a Secure Site. You will enter our Secure Site once you choose to "Check Out" and enter credit card information.What are cookies and how do they affect my privacy?Simply put, a "cookie" is a small file that serves as an identifier stored on your machine. Although they are not required, we use cookies to make registration and logging in easier for you. For instance, if you begin the registration process and then need to stop and come back to it later, you won't have to re-enter information you've already typed in.If you have any additional questions about our privacy practices, feel free to send us an email.
