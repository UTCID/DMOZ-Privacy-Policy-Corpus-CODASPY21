Terms of Use
Welcome to our Terms of Use!
We think this policy stuff is a bit boring, too, but we had to write it like this to avoid any confusion. So, truck on through – we know you’ll make it to the end!
Last Updated:  May 21, 2018
This website, located at www.ModCloth.com or any of our affiliated sites including mobile and/or Internet applications or “apps” (collectively, the “Site”), is provided by Jet.com, Inc. dba ModCloth (ModCloth, “we,” “our,” or “us”) to the person accessing this Site (“you,” “your”).

User-Submitted Content
The Site may, from time to time, offer interactive features that allow users to submit content to the Site. ModCloth does not and cannot review all such content, and is not responsible for such content.
You acknowledge that by providing the ability to view and distribute user-generated content on the Site, ModCloth is merely acting as a passive conduit for such distribution and is not undertaking any obligation or liability related thereto. By submitting any user-generated content, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are the sole creator and/or author of any such content including any intellectual property rights therein, or before posting, you obtained from the copyright owner the right to use and authorize ModCloth to use; (b) you hereby waive any moral rights you may have in such user-generated content; (c) and all such content is true and accurate; and (d) you are the person appearing in any photograph or content uploaded. In any event, ModCloth reserves the right to block or remove communications or materials that it determines to be unacceptable to ModCloth in its sole discretion.
By submitting any user-generated content, you hereby grant ModCloth (1) a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable right and license to use, copy, modify, delete in its entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, and/or sell and/or distribute such content and/or incorporate such content into any form, medium, or technology throughout the world without compensation to you; and (2) the rights to publicity to use your name and/or likeness.

Privacy
ModCloth’s Privacy Policy is incorporated and made part of these Terms of Use. You hereby agree to such Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Links
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, ModCloth may link to sites operated by third parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with ModCloth, ModCloth has no control over these linked sites, all of which may have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of ModCloth. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Without limiting the foregoing, ModCloth specifically disclaims any responsibility if such sites: infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights; are inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; are not merchantable or fit for a particular purpose; do not provide adequate security; contain viruses or other items of a destructive nature; or are libelous or defamatory.
ModCloth does not endorse the content, or any products or services available, on such sites. Nonetheless, ModCloth seeks to protect the integrity of its website and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own Site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work). Any feedback you provide shall be non-confidential and non-proprietary.

Referral Program
ModCloth may offer you the opportunity to earn referral rewards by referring friends to join.

They are not gift certificates, they cannot be used to purchase gift certificates, and they cannot be obtained by purchasing gift certificates. Referral rewards expire six (6) months after they are granted.  ModCloth reserves the right to revoke referral rewards if we determine that you have engaged in fraudulent referral activity (e.g., inviting yourself to join with a fake email address, using spam to obtain referrals, or acquiring referrals through unsolicited email to persons unknown to you), if you have otherwise violated our referral program terms, or if you have violated the Site’s Terms of Use.
Referral rewards are granted at ModCloth’s sole discretion. We reserve the right to amend these guidelines and the methods through which referral rewards are earned at any time without notice to you. For more information about the referral program, please review the full Terms and Conditions at http://www.modcloth.com/help/terms-of-use/modcloth-referral-program-terms.
