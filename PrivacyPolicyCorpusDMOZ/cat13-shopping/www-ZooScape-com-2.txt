Each product has a weight, and a size determined by length, width and height.In determining the Shipping Weight of a package, the maximum of either the Total Weight or the Minimum Density Weight (MDW) must be used.The MDW is determined to ensure that the shipping fee for lightweight and bulky parcels adequately covers the cost of transportation for the space they occupy. It is calculated by using the following formula: (length X width X height) / 6000.Delivery Time EstimateSuggested delivery times are estimates only and do not constitute a guarantee.Restricted CountriesWe regret that we only accept bank drafts and money orders for the following countries:Bulgaria, Georgia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Moldova, Pakistan, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.Go To Top  |   Your CartReturns, Exchanges and RefundsYour Satisfaction is Guaranteed!If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you may return the unopened and unused product to us for a refund, replacement or credit!Please note the following:Shipping fees are not refundable.For health reasons, we cannot accept the return of hygiene items or intimate personal items.We reserve the right to substitute items of equal or greater value.We cannot guarantee the delivery of parcels outside United States or Canada.We cannot accept the return of damaged goods.We cannot accept returns if there are Customs, Duty or shipping fees owing.

Orders cannot be canceled via email. Orders that have already been shipped cannot be cancelled. While we regret having to charge for a cancelled order, some people place orders impulsively and then, shortly after, decide they would like to cancel their order. Because of this, we have had to implement this policy. Please understand that even though your item may not have been shipped, ZooScape.com will incur administration costs, phone calls, paper usage and credit card processing fees. So, in an attempt to offer you the lowest prices possible, we are charging a very reasonable cancellation fee of 10% of the value of the total order (including taxes and shipping costs) placed via credit card.Go To Top  |   Your CartWhere is my Order?Has my order been shipped?We cannot guarantee that all products in your order will ship immediately, since our inventory can change dramatically from one moment to the next. Indeed, a product may be in stock when you place your order, and sold out by the time your order is processed for shipping. If one of your ordered items is out of stock, we will try to wait until all ordered products are in stock before shipping your order.
When your out-of-stock item arrives at our warehouse, we will ship you your entire order.
We cannot guarantee when a temporarily out-of-stock item will arrive at our warehouse, but it is usually within 2-3 business days.When will my order arrive?Typically, all orders are shipped by the next business day.
