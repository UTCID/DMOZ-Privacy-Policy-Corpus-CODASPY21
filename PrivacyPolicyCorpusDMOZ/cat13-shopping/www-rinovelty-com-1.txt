In accordance with various state and local laws, Rhode Island Novelty is required to charge sales tax in certain states. Rhode Island Novelty does not benefit from the collection of sales taxes and all taxes collected are remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.
Rhode Island Novelty collects sales tax in:

Purchases shipped to states that Rhode Island Novelty does not collect sales tax in may be subject to sales and use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return annually and report taxable purchases that were not taxed. Contact your state’s Department of Revenue for more information regarding remittance of sales/use tax.
This policy is subject to change as state laws regarding sales tax continue to change. Rhode Island Novelty is committed to complying with state and local tax laws and will continue to monitor and update this policy as those laws change.

Please send your tax-exempt certificate or resale certificate along with your customer number to:
Email: salestax@rinovelty.com
Fax:  919-576-1706
Mailing Address:

Orders will be shipped and charged tax if we do not have a tax-exempt certificate on file.

Once the certificate has been approved, we will issue a credit for taxes collected on that invoice.
