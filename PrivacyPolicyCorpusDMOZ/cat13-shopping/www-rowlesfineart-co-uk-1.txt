Privacy Policy
Why we value your privacy
We take your privacy seriously.
We will never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we'll never give anyone access to it unless we're forced to by law.
What Information We Collect
On this website, we ask for your information for two specific purposes:
1] To answer your specific enquiries. We will ask for your name, email (and on our contact page, your phone number) in order to respond to your enquiry.
2] If you sign up to our newsletter, we will collect your name and email address, in order to deliver our newsletter.
Offline, we only store further information about you if you have purchased something from us; in which case, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and physical address, and keep this informamtion for invoicing and for our business accounts.
Where we store your information
Information is held on our business computer, located at our gallery, which is password protected. We also use a third party (MailChimp) to send out our email newsletters - if you have signed up for our newsletter, your information will be saved on the MailChimp web servers, which can only be accessed securely with a password. Enquiries made on our website are delivered to us over email, and all of our our Rowles Fine Art email accounts are accessed with mobile devices of our staff, and our main computer in the Gallery. All email accounts are accessed securely and are password protected.
What we use your information for
As mentioned above, we only store your information in order to answer specific enquiries, to send you our newsletters (if you have subscribed to them), or for invoicing purposes/accounts. If you receive our email newsletter, you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe link in the newsletter. We might also email or phone you about an artwork if it is relevant, but if you tell us not to, we won't get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.
