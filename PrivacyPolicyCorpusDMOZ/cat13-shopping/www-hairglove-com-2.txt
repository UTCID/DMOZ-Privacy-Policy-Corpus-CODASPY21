Hair Glove collects information from our users at several different points on our website, but generally, users can browse our site without providing personal information. We automatically collect non-personal information such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, and site usage information, in order to evaluate and improve the performance of our site. We may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, address, and e-mail address, for example when you contact us for a purchase or sign up for our newsletter.
We collect and use information for the specific purposes for which you provide it, such as when you request information from us. We also collect and use information:
to enhance your experience at our site;
to perform site administration and technical support;
to notify you about our new and existing content, events, properties or services;
to enable you to enter promotional campaigns;
to create aggregate information about demographics and usage patterns.
We may also use third-party providers to help us contact you or to support our site and services, and for these limited purposes, we may share your personally identifiable information with our providers. By registering for and/or using our site, you consent to our sharing of your personal information with our third-party providers for these limited purposes.
We may disclose personal information when required by law to do so, or at the request of a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to avoid violation of, or interference with, the terms of use of our site or services, or with our proprietary rights, or the rights of third parties.
We will not sell, share, or rent this personal information to other third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit permission, except as disclosed in this policy.
We may use aggregate information to measure general site usage patterns and characteristics of our user base, and we may include such aggregate information about our audience in reports to our partners or vendors. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 28% of our members live in Indiana) without your permission in order to describe our audience to existing and prospective sponsors, wholesalers, affiliates or other third parties. However, this aggregate information does not reference names, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it is not traceable to a specific recipient or e-mail address.
Submitted Content
We invite and welcome feedback and comment on the products you use or might like to purchase. Any inquiries, feedback, suggestions, ideas, images, videos, experiences, emails or other information you provide us (collectively, "Submissions") will be treated as non-proprietary and non-confidential. By transmitting via email or posting any Submission on our website or affiliated social media platforms, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, sell, assign, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display any Submission in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, alone or as part of other works. This includes promotion and use of Hot Looks photos submitted for participation in our monthly contest. These photos can be used in marketing and social media promotion indefinitely. You also acknowledge that your Submission may not be returned and we may use your Submission, and any ideas, concepts or know how contained therein, for any purpose including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing products.
If you make a Submission, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control the rights to your Submission. You further represent and warrant that such Submission does not constitute or contain software viruses, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead us as to the origin of any Submission. You agree to indemnify us for all claims arising from your claims to any rights in any Submission.
Security
The security of your information is very important to us. We use 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Hair Glove. Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:
The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
Depending on the browser, you may see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser section
Personal information collected by Hair Glove is stored in secure operating environments, and we are dedicated to maintaining the security of such information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. We will notify you if any breach of our security system affects you by sending an e-mail notice to you within 5-7 days of our discovery of any such breach.
