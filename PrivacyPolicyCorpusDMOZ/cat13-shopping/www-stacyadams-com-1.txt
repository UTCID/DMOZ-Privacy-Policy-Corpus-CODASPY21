Governing Law; Venue.
These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of Wisconsin, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
Except with regard to disputes which are subject to arbitration under this Agreement, venue for any other dispute arising under this Agreement is exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin with respect to any dispute arising under these Terms and you expressly agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.
Any cause of action or other claim with respect to the Site must be commenced within one year after the cause of action or claim arises. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS WAIVER; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH STACY ADAMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity hereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of these Terms to arbitrate (hereinafter, collectively, the “Dispute”), which cannot be resolved informally, shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms set forth below (the “Arbitration Agreement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary however, you and Stacy Adams each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights.
The institution of any action for injunctive relief shall not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to arbitration.
Arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before one arbitrator selected pursuant to the AAA rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding and will not have precedential effect. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to award damages outside of those set forth in these Terms.
Any final award or judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration, and each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims were improper or frivolous, in which case the arbitrator may require you to reimburse us for certain fees and expenses in accordance with AAA rules. Any arbitration proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other proceeding and will not proceed as a class action. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING INVOLVING MULTIPLE CLAIMANTS, BUT THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE AND AGREE TO HAVE ALL DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN DECIDED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
Place. The place of arbitration shall be in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. The parties acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1–16, shall govern the interpretation, enforcement and proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. The parties expressly agree that any and all actions taken under the Arbitration Agreement and related provisions, including but not limited to all filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration proceeding, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party,
Survival. This Arbitration Agreement provision will survive the termination of these Terms.
Time Limitation on Claims. Subject to applicable law, any claim by you arising in connection with the Site or your purchase of products must be commenced by you within one (1) year of the Dispute giving rise to the claim.
Changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If Stacy Adams modifies this arbitration provision, you may reject that change by sending Stacy Adams written notice within thirty (30) days of our posting of the change, in which case we will terminate your Account(s) and you must stop using the Site.
