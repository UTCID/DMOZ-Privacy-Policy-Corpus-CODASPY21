Privacy Policy 21st May 2018Who I amHello, I'm Michael (Nobbs). Go Gently is my website and this is my privacy policy.I hope that is policy is clear and easy to understand and will help you see that I take your privacy and the care of any information that you trust me with very seriously.My aim is to only ask for and make use of information that is essential for the running of my business. I never sell, rent or trade your information with others for marketing purposes.This Privacy Policy details when and why I collect your personal information, how I use it, the limited conditions under which I may disclose it to others and how I keep it secure.Mailing ListsThe main use that I make use of your personal information is if you sign up for one or more of my mailing lists.I currently have three permanent mailing lists all delivered by a third party provider, MailChimp.THESE LISTS ARE:The Go Gently Letter list.The One Thing Today podcast list.Creative Circle members' list.From time to time I may also create other temporary email lists that you may join if you take one of my courses. These lists will only be used to deliver course information and will be deleted once the course is finished.I gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help me monitor and improve my offerings. For more information, please see MailChimp’s privacy notice.You can unsubscribe from my mailing lists at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of my emails or by contacting me at michael@michaelnobbs.com.OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS.I will store and make use of your name and email address if you are one of my mentoring clients. I use Google G Suite to handle my work emails and address book (G Suite & Google Cloud Platform Commitments to the GDPR).I am currently deciding how long it is useful and necessary to keep emails from clients. Once I reached a decision I will post that here, but in the meantime, you are of course welcome to contact me to ask what emails I have from you (and ask me to delete them if you would like me to) by contacting me at michael@michaelnobbs.com.ONLINE APPOINTMENT BOOKING SYSTEMIf you book appointments with me via my Calendly account then they will also hold a copy of the information you supply (Calendly's privacy policy). Your appointment will be stored on my Google calendar.Sales initiated on my websiteMost sales of my offerings or books initiated on this site are handled by either Amazon(books) or Teachable (courses) and I don't hold any data relating to the sales.In the case of courses booked via Teachable, your details will be added, with your permission, to the relevant course email list for the duration of the course.ONE-TO-ONE SESSION SALESThe one exception to the holding of personal data related to sales is if you book one-to-one mentoring sessions with me. In this case. I will store your details both on my work email account and within my accounting software, Freeagent. I will need to keep a record of your purchase for as long as is legally required by HMRC in the UK for the purposes of my tax returns.If you book a block of mentoring sessions with me you are able to pay via bank transfer or by credit/debit card via a payment processor. I offer use of Stripe and PayPal for the processing of payments and if you use one of those methods I will receive limited information about your purchase from them.
