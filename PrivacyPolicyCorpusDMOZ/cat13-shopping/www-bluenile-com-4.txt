We may also combine the information you provide to us over time and we may combine such information with information that is publicly available, collected through cookies and other technologies, and information that we receive from our partners, affiliates and other third parties. We may use that combined information to better provide you the Services and to better provide you personalized content, customized content and advertising.
We value your comments, feedback, testimonials, etc., which help us improve our services and products. By making such submissions to us, you assign your rights in the submissions to us as described in the "Submissions" section of our Terms and Conditions page.
Tracking Technology
We may use, or permit our business partners to use, the following tracking technologies for the purposes described below:
Cookies: A cookie is a small file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us or our business partners to recognize your device when you return to our Site and record information about your usage of our Site.
We use cookies for five general purposes as follows:
Essential Operational: Cookies are necessary to allow us to operate our Services. For example, they are required to help you access secure areas (such as your account pages) and to use features like our shopping basket.
Performance and Functionality: Cookies help us enhance the performance and functionality of our Services. For example, cookies help us identify you or your device when you come back to our Service so that you do not have to login to see your shopping basket.
Analytics, Customization and Security: We use analytics and customization cookies, including third party cookies, to gather information on how our Services are being used by our visitors and to measure how popular our marketing campaigns are. We use the data we get to help customize our Services for you and make the content you see as relevant as possible. We also use the data we collect to help identify and prevent fraud, and to track visits from our affiliates or partners.
Targeting/advertising: Cookies help us to customize and regulate (e.g., by capping the frequency of) the advertisements you receive, provide you with tailored offers, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising. For instance, if we target an ad campaign through an online advertising network, we might use cookies on our Site to estimate how many viewers of the ad later visited our Site – and therefore, how effective the ad campaign was. Or, we might “retarget” visitors to our Site by providing them offers (whether through online display media, email or direct mail) similar to those they viewed or expressed interest in during their Site visits. See the section below titled Interest Based Advertising for more information.
Social networking cookies: Cookies allow visitors to share our pages and content through third-party social networking websites.
Website and mobile application log files: We may make use of log files created automatically with access and use of our Services for analytics purposes.
Tracking Images: We may use tracking images (such as GIFs), which are small image files that we embed into our e-mails, to learn whether you opened or forwarded the e-mail or clicked on any of the content. This information tells us about our e-mail’s effectiveness and helps us ensure that we’re delivering information that you find interesting.
Local Storage: We use local storage (such as HTML5 or Flash) to provide you a rich web experience and to provide you with relevant content and advertising.
Other technologies: We may make use of other tracking technologies similar to the ones described above for similar purposes described above.
Interest Based Advertising: Third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, including our Site. Third parties we work with may also use other “device-graphing” information in order to make inferences and connections about our customers and potential customers across various devices – such as mobile phones, tablets and browsers. (These companies may, for instance, make inferences that devices seen at a common IP address are used by common users.) Companies that we share information with may use the information we provide to them, often in combination with their existing information, to provide you with more relevant advertising tailored to your interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Blue Nile advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks.
Information That We May Share With Others
Along with the sharing described above, we may share your information, including personal information, with others as follows:
Blue Nile entities: We may share your personal information with our affiliated entities, e.g., any corporate subsidiaries or affiliates.
Service Providers: We may use third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf, including: shipping, payment processing, billing and collections, data storage/management, webhosting, fulfillment, assembly, marketing and data enhancement, mailing, and emailing as well as various customer, tech and operational support.
Special Events: If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a promotion, contest, or sweepstakes), Blue Nile may share your information with those organizations participating in the applicable event.
Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection: We may disclose your information: (1) when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, such as lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (2) in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding potential illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or situations involving potential violations of our Terms and Conditions or other policies; (3) to other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction; and (4) to enforce any agreement we have with you.
Business Transfer: Your information may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership (or in due diligence leading up to any acquisition), in which case information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the Company.
Aggregate Information: We may, and we may authorize third parties to, create aggregate records from personal information by excluding information that makes the information identifiable. We may use and disclose, and authorize third parties to use and disclose, aggregate non-personal information at our discretion.
Children Under 13
Blue Nile does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Please visit the FTC's website at https://www.ftc.gov for tips on protecting children's privacy online.
Links
Our Site may provide links to third-party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) websites.
Security
We utilize a combination of physical and electronic security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. While we strive to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us.
Accessing And Updating Your Information
If you have created a Blue Nile account you can review and change certain personal information relating to your Blue Nile account at any time by logging on to your account. Otherwise, to learn more, please contact us as set forth below.
Marketing Choice/Opt-Out
Where permitted by applicable law, we want to communicate with you on our marketing initiatives, but only if you want to continue to hear from us.
E-mail promotions: To opt out of receiving e-mail promotions that we send you: (1) select "unsubscribe" on our subscription status page and enter the requested information or follow the unsubscribe instructions in any of our promotional emails; or (2) write to Legal Department at 411 First Avenue, South, Suite 700, Seattle, WA, 98104 (a "postal request"). To opt out of telephone promotions, you can tell us when we call you or you can send us a postal request. To opt out of postal mail promotions, please send us a postal request. Opting out of communication with us does not affect our communications with you via telephone or email related to your orders with us or other transactional emails.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies: You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits; although, by declining the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on, and significant portions of, our Site. Also, because information we obtain may be combined, we may still be able to identify your web browser, computer or mobile device when you access our Services even if you disable cookies. Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. For more information about the use of cookies and how to block them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org, www.youronlinechoices.eu (Europe) or www.aboutads.info/choices (United States).
Interest Based Advertising: You may opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from advertising companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and www.aboutads.info/choices.
Where required by law, we obtain your prior opt-in consent at the time of data collection for the processing of (i) personal information for marketing purposes and (ii) personal information deemed sensitive pursuant to applicable law.
Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act:
Right to Know. You have the right to know and see what data we have collected about you over the past 12 months, including:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Right to Delete. You have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (and direct our service providers to do the same).
Other Rights. You can request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. This request is free and may be made once a year. You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.
To exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, please contact us by either sending us an e-mail, or by phone at 1-877-374-9136. Please provide your full name and e-mail address so that we may respond to your request as quickly as possible. You will be required to verify your identify before we fulfill your request.

You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To do so, you must provide us with written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf.
You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
California law requires certain disclosures about Personal Information we ‘sell,’ which for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), means making personal information available to third parties in exchange for valuable consideration, which some may claim includes allowing advertising companies to collect unique cookie IDs through our sites when you use our Services. Under that interpretation, we ‘sell’ personal information to advertise our products to you. In the preceding 12 months, we have ‘sold’ the following categories of personal information to the following categories of third parties:
Categories:
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
Third Parties:
Interested based advertising partners
For more information about Interest Based Advertisers, please see the Interest Based Advertising section above.
You have the right to opt out of these sales at any time by visiting our Do Not Sell My Personal Information page. We do not knowingly ‘sell’ personal information about consumers under the age of 16.
Data Protection For Individuals Based In The European Economic Area And Switzerland
If you are a customer or website visitor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, the following, additional information is relevant to you.
(Please do not rely on the below if you are not located in an EEA nation or Switzerland.):
Blue Nile, Inc., having its registered address at 411 First Avenue S., Suite 700, Seattle, Washington, 98104, United States, is the data controller of your personal information for purposes of the EU General data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). All customer orders are processed exclusively by Blue Nile, Inc.
The representative of Blue Nile, Inc. in the EEA for data protection purposes is Blue Nile Jewellery Limited, having its registered address at 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, D02 R296, Ireland.
We only process your personal information if you have consented to such processing or, to the extent that it is necessary (i) for the performance of your agreement with us or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into an agreement with us; (ii) to comply with our legal obligations; or (iii) for the purpose of our legitimate interests, including operating, evaluating and improving our global business. As required under the GDPR, we have carefully balanced our legitimate business interests against your data protection rights.
For companies like Blue Nile, Inc. that have global business operations, processing customer’s personal information for internal administrative purposes customer relations or direct marketing is typically also considered a legitimate interest under the GDPR.
Your personal information will be hosted in and managed from the United States, where Blue Nile, Inc. is based. The law in the United States may not offer the same level of privacy and data protection as the law in your home country. We will rely on Blue Nile’s need of your personal information for the performance of our contract with you for this transfer to the United States. When your personal information is transferred to (or accessed from) other countries outside the EEA for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected. This may include data transfer agreements, a copy of which you can obtain by contacting us as indicated in the “How To Contact Us” section below.
In general we will store your personal information as long as the information is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it (as explained in the “Use of Your Personal Information” section). We are committed to being our customers’ jeweler for life. If you become a customer of Blue Nile, Inc., you may be eligible for many lifetime benefits, including, but not limited to: our lifetime diamond upgrade program, our lifetime product warranty, and lifetime repairs, cleaning, and resizing of jewelry. If you decide to take advantage of these benefits, we will keep your information until you (or your next of kin) ask us to remove your personal information from our records. Once your personal information has been removed from our records, it will not be possible to warranty, upgrade, clean, repair, or resize any product that you have purchased with us.
You have the right to request access to the personal information that we process about you, to have your personal information corrected or erased, to restrict the processing of your personal information, as well as the right to data portability (certain of these rights are subject to our obligation to verify your identify). To exercise these rights, you should submit a written request using the contact details set out below. If you are not satisfied with the way we handle your request, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your home country.
Where we have obtained your consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Use these links to withdraw your consent to e-mail marketing
or your consent to the use of cookies. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing that has happened based on your consent prior to the withdrawal.
You also have the right to object, at any time, to the processing of your personal information which is based on Blue Nile, Inc.’s legitimate interests, provided that we may retain your personal information for certain compelling purposes such as legal, auditing, accounting and billing purposes. Where we process your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to such processing, including for profiling purposes to the extent that it is related to direct marketing. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal information for such purposes.
