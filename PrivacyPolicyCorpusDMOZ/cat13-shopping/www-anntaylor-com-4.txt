ARBITRATION IF A DISPUTE ARISES ("Arbitration Agreement")
Scope of the Arbitration Agreement. Any legal dispute between you and Ann Taylor concerning or arising out of your use of the Site, any products or services sold or distributed through the Site, your participation in any program or service provided by Ann Taylor, or any other dispute of any nature, shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration. However, either you or Ann Taylor may bring any individual claim in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim.
How Arbitration Works. Disputes will be resolved solely by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the streamlined Arbitration Rules Procedures of JAMS Inc. ("JAMS") or any successor to JAMS. In the event JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a "Demand for Arbitration", then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by another mutually agreeable arbitration administration service who will hear the case. Unless you and Ann Taylor agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing shall take place in the county of your residence. If you live outside the United States, any arbitration will take place in New York, New York. We encourage you to call Ann Taylor in advance of filing a claim for arbitration to see if the dispute can be settled prior to arbitration.
Waiver of Right to Bring Class Action and Representative Claims. All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other customer. You and Ann Taylor also agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and Ann Taylor hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, to assert or participate in a private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.
Arbitration Costs. Ann Taylor will pay all filing, administrative, arbitrator and hearing costs and waives any rights it may have to recover an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses against you.
Other Terms & Information. This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and other applicable federal law. To the extent state law applies to any aspect of these Terms and Conditions, or to any disputes and claims that are covered by the Arbitration Agreement, the law of the State of New York will govern. Except as set forth above, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement.
Miscellaneous
This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions. The waiver of any provision of the Agreement shall not be considered a waiver of any other provision or of Ann Taylor's right to require strict observance of each of the terms herein. If any provision of the Agreement is deemed to be illegal or unenforceable the remainder of the Agreement shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us relating to your use of the Site.
Termination
Ann Taylor may terminate this Agreement and deny you access to the Site at any time, immediately and without notice, if in Ann Taylor's sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.
