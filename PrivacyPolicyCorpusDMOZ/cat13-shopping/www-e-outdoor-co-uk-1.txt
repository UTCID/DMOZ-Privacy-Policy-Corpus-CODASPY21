We will take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of Products appearing on the Website are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system.

Contract creation and electronic contracting
The technical steps required to create the contract between you and us are as follows:
You place the order for your products on the Website by pressing the confirm order button at the end of the checkout process. You will be guided through the process of placing an order by a series of simple instructions on the Website
You'll need JavaScript enabled on your computer to buy products and check out. Please enable JavaScript in your browser, then refresh your browser to continue.
We will send you an order confirmation email detailing the products you have ordered. This is not an order acceptance.
When your product is shipped from our warehouse we will send you a despatch confirmation email
Order acceptance and the completion of the contract between you and us will take place on the despatch to you of the Products ordered unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order, or you have cancelled it in accordance with the instructions.
For most products you may be charged at any point between confirmation of your order and despatch. The exact timing of this will vary according to the payment service being used and the credit checking process.
Non-acceptance of an order may be a result of one of the following:

Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013
This legislation offers you the following cancellation rights when you buy online or by phone:
You are entitled to cancel your contract if you so wish, provided that you exercise your right no longer than 14 days after the day on which you receive the goods or services.
Your right to return or cancel products does not apply to goods that are made to measure or are made to your specification, that have been clearly personalised or which by reason of their nature cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly. This doesn't affect your statutory rights if goods are faulty or not as described.
If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation, you are obliged to retain possession of the goods and take reasonable care of them.
To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel your contract by a clear statement, including details of your name, geographical address, details of the order you wish to cancel and, where available, your phone number and email address.
You can cancel by email or call 0160 430 0127, or write to: Customer Services, E-Outdoor, Bentley Way, Daventry NN11 8QH.
If you decide to cancel, you should return the goods to us at your cost within 14 days of such cancellation and we will reimburse to you (by the method used to pay for the original transaction) the amount in relation to goods to which cancellation rights apply. This includes the cost of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you choose a type of delivery other than our standard and least expensive method of delivery).
We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you. We will make the reimbursement no later than 14 days after the day we receive back from you any goods supplied.
Our Returns Policy
We offer free return postage to customers in the UK who are returning items to us for an alternative item using our Royal Mail Tracked returns service, this is not not offered on order being returned to us for a refund. In addition to our obligations in law, The Website operates a fair policy of accepting returns provided the goods and their packaging are received back by us within 30 days in accordance with the
following guidelines:
Please advise us
by email to sales@extremegb.com within 30 days of delivery that you wish
to make a return and quote your order number.
We will send you details of your returns number and the correct address to use.
Please ensure the packaging and goods are returned to us in 'as new' condition. Damaged or used goods cannot be refunded.
We recommend returning to us using a tracked or signed postal service. You will be credited for the goods once they the have been received by us.
Should you choose to exchange your item, you will not be reimbursed for the original shipping costs.
If you have asked for an exchange of size or colour, or an alternative item, your replacement item will be charged at the current website rate.
Goods described as available 'by special order only' may not be returnable or may be subject to a restocking fee.
The goods you can’t return
There are some goods you can't return if you simply change your mind, including: climbing safety equipment, safety headwear, including climbing, cycling and ski helmets, swimwear and underwear, where hygiene protection has been removed, consumables, such as food, other perishables and batteries, personalised goods, CDs, DVDs or software if you've broken the seal on the wrapping and earrings.
Goods damaged in transit
If your package arrives damaged, please ensure the carrier is notified at the time of delivery and do not sign for the package as undamaged. For a valid claim to be made, please contact us within 24 hours of receipt and keep all the external packaging with the damaged product.
GIFTS: Provided we are notified by email at the time the order is placed that the order is a gift for a specified
date, we will accept returned orders
up to 30 days after the specified date.
Undeliverable Items
All of our items are sent via a recorded method of delivery. If an item cannot be signed for upon delivery it will be held at your local sorting office. Items are not held indefinitely and will eventually be returned to us. You will be charged further shipping should you wish for the items to be re-dispatched. We attempt to contact all customers whose items are returned to us.
If you choose not to have the item re-sent the original amount charged for shipping will not be refunded.
Deliveries to the US
How long does it take for my parcel to arrive in the US?
We use an International Postal service which normally delivers in 3-5 working days. You should allow a little longer.
Goods imported into the US for personal use
It is very rare for US recipients of our goods to have to pay US or state import taxes. See the US customs statement below but if you
are concerned about this please mail us.
"INTERNATIONAL MAIL IMPORTS Customs Inspections of Mailed
Parcels" (Except from US Treasury)
"... when a package
first enters the United States, it arrives at a post office near the addressee. That Postal Service will route it to one of 13 Customs international mail facilities, where Customs inspectors will determine whether duty is owed.
Customs then returns the package to the Postal Service for delivery (unless the value of the package is over $2000, in which case the package will be held by
Customs until formal entry can be made)."
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (or WEEE) Regulations are now UK law. All European member States including the UK have agreed to reduce the amount of WEEE that is being disposed of in landfill sites.
It is important that the amount of WEEE sent to landfill sites is reduced because:
Some WEEE can be re-used or recycled.
The amount of landfill space available in the UK is decreasing. If we can keep WEEE out of landfill sites it means there is more landfill space available for non-recyclable waste.
WEEE can contain hazardous substances. When left in landfill sites the hazardous substances in WEEE can pollute soil and contaminate water supplies. This contamination can damage human health and the environment.
Distributors of new Electric and Electronic Equipment (or EEE) have a part to play in reducing the amount of WEEE going into landfill sites.
ExtremeGB are 'doing our bit' under these regulations by offering our customers free take-back of their WEEE on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new Electrical or Electronic product.
For example, if a customer buys a new 12V hairdryer from us, we will take back their old 12V hairdryer (provided it is of equivalent type and function) and prevent it going into a landfill site by disposing of it safely. Customers must return their old WEEE within 28 days of purchasing their new item. Customers do not have to pay to return their old item to us.
If you wish to return your WEEE item, please contact us at the telephone number at the bottom of the page:
Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol shown below:
Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13 August 2005 and should be disposed of separately from normal household waste.
