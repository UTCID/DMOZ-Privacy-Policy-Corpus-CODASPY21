Copyright Policy and Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Notice
Boutique Jacques respects the copyright interests of others and, as such, requires our users to comply with these Terms of Use and all applicable laws regarding copyrights.

In the case of a copyright violation please provide the following information:
a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site (including the exact URL);
an address, a telephone number, and an email address where we can contact you and, if different, an email address where the alleged infringing party, if not Boutique Jacques, can contact you;
a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property rights owner, by its agent, or by law; and
a statement by you under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on the owner's behalf.

It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated. We may request additional information before we remove allegedly infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove the content of both parties.
Miscellaneous
We may be required by provincial or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on the Site or delivering them to you through the email address we have for you. We cannot be held liable if we fail to notify you via mail or email. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within six (6) months after such claim or cause of action arose or it will be forever barred. These Terms of Use, and all terms, conditions, and policies that are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Boutique Jacques and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements that you may have with us. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.
