Last updated: Thursday 10 December 2020
Welcome to our international incident bulletin; a round up of any issues which may be affecting mail services to and from countries around the world.
We keep this information as up-to-date as possible, with information supplied to Royal Mail by the various foreign national postal authorities.
Coronavirus International delivery
We are working with our airline and postal/courier partners across the globe to maintain services, however delays should be expected. Many countries have implemented special measure to combat the spread of Coronavirus COVID-19, especially for signature service to maintain social distancing.
The number of countries that we can access is changing daily. Most major export routes remain open, and we continue to accept and process mail, although customers may experience varying levels of delay. We recommend that you try and post early when sending gifts and care packages for Christmas.
There are significant delays to a number of countries right now due to a lack of available transport links and suspension of certain country’s postal operations. We strongly advise not to send items to destinations listed as ‘On suspension’ below.

Start date: 30 September 2020
Latest Update:
End date: Ongoing
Incident: Additional Prohibited Products
Australia Post has advised of significant delays at the Australian border, due to exceptionally high volumes and 100% checks on all inbound mail by the border agency. There are no delays to letters and parcels being despatched to Australia from the UK.
Please check the official Australian Government website for more details and a full list of prohibited products.
We recommend posting to Australia as early as possible this year, the Latest Recommended Posting Date has been brought forward to 4 December 2020 as a precaution to allow for delays.
Start date: 12 March 2020
Latest Update: 19 June 2020
End date: Ongoing
Incident: Coronavirus
Update: 19 June 2020
There are no delays to letters and parcels being despatched to Australia from the UK. During April and early May, we had less regular access to Australia, but this has now stabilised and we have regular freight flights via en-route transit points. This means mail takes a little longer than usual, but is a reliable shipment route.
Mail to Australia is currently only entering via Sydney, as opposed to multiple gateways normally used to get items closer to their final destination.
A huge reduction in airline capacity means this is not possible at the moment. Also, mail volumes into Australia, like many countries, is significantly higher than usual.As a result, there are considerable delays in items passing through the Sydney gateway and into Australia Post's domestic network, as well as extended delivery times once in country. For more information, please visit the Australia Post website.
Update: 2 June 2020
Australia Post are currently experiencing higher than Christmas peak volumes of mail. There is currently no air backlogs, however we are currently only shipping into Sydney which means onward transport is required for mail to reach destination causing delays. There are also Coronavirus 'hot-spots' around Australia which may cause further delays.
Update: 22 April 2020
The measures implemented in Australia to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 are also affecting delivery standards. As a result, delays to letter and parcel deliveries may be apparent.
Original Incident: 12 March 2020
Australian Post has informed us that it has suspended signature on delivery for inbound items effective immediately. Delivery will be conducted via limited face-to-face methods to reduce the risk of the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by avoiding human contact.

Canada
Start date: 16 March 2020
Latest Update: 22 September 2020
End date: Ongoing
Incident: Coronavirus
Update: 22 September 2020Canada Post has updated that the special measures and changes to delivery process previously outlined remain in place. Items requiring a signature or customs payments are to be delivered to nearby Post offices with a card delivered to addresse's mail box for them to collect within 15 days before being returned to sender.
Canada Post continues to experience significant disruption to its activities due to the exceptional precautionary measures, hence Force Majeure remains in place for all mail types.
Update: 1 August 2020CANADA DELAYS: All mail being sent from the UK to Canada is facing severe delays because of the on-going impact of COVID-19 and record volumes of traffic being received in Canada. We are processing the mail as normal in the UK, but delays are taking place once the mail reaches the Canadian border. As a result, we are unable to advise on likely delivery times.
Update: 1 July 2020
Canada Post has received unprecedented volumes of mail in the past months, particularly at their Toronto gateway. They are recruiting additional staff and working overtime to reduce the incoming volumes and accumulated backlog, and significant delays will be experienced. Some items may also be delivered out of date order.
Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), responsible for customs clearance, has also experienced significant Coronavirus related staff absenteeism which added to this issue, but they are also now bringing in additional resource.
Update: 19 June 2020
There are no delays to letters and parcels leaving the UK destined for Canada. The overwhelming majority of items enter Canada via the Toronto gateway, where record levels of mail are creating significant delays at the entry point. Canada Post has been affected, as all logistics operations, with reduced staffing and social distancing requirements impacting on efficiency and processing times.
Until May, the majority of Tracked services were being delivered in under 15 days. Since w/c 11 May, already congested gateway operations have been further compounded by searches for Fentanyl (an opioid drug), required by customs authorities. This is causing additional delays.
Customers may also experience items being delivered out of sequence. This affects all mail, not just that from Royal Mail.
For further updates, please visit the
Canada Post website.
Update: 2 June 2020
Canada Post are experiencing extremely high volumes of mail, customers can expect significant delays as Canada Post recover. There are large backlogs in Toronto, new mail postings into Toronto can expect delays of 7-10 days above normal delivery aims.
Original Incident: 16 March 2020
Canada has put special measures in place from Monday 16 March, to limit the spread of Coronavirus. Canada Post need to comply and is also likely to have a reduced workforce
available, and not be able to deliver all mail to specifications. Signature on delivery is suspended and delays to mail services can be expected.
Other service affecting issues:
Start date: 9 October 2017
Incident: High mail volumes entering Canada
What's the issue?
As previously advised, Canada Post have notified us that they are experiencing delays to delivery services due to high volumes of incoming mail. Delivery aims for Royal Mail services for Canada are normally 5-7 working day, however, International Standard and International Tracked & Signed are severely delayed, taking 3-4 weeks to be delivered.
What alternative is there?
If you have been posting using our Royal Mail 'Tracked and Signed service', we highly recommend you use our 'Tracked service' option which is providing much speedier processing and delivery times. Simply select the correct service and label. If you are not set up on our Tracked service, please talk to your usual Royal Mail contact who will help you with the next steps. Finally for our Customers using the Post Office to send your items, simply ask for a "Tracked service" at the counter.
A note about Customs in Canada
Whilst Customs clearing processing times are totally outside our control, it is worth remembering that Canada is one the countries with the lowest de-minimis of 20 Canadian Dollars (circa £11). This means that any goods equal or above that value will systematically go through a clearance process thus creating additional delays. Most of what our customers send is under DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid) meaning that the recipient is responsible to pay any duty or taxes. Read more on our country guide page royalmail.com/canada, thank you.

Incident: Coronavirus
Update: 13 February 2020
Items leaving the UK for China
We are maintaining our services to China. However, the emergency associated with the Coronavirus has reduced the air capacity available in the market and impacted our (and other carriers’) ability to convey all items to China for delivery in the usual manner and timescales.
Royal Mail is working hard with our partners to secure alternative air capacity so we can continue running our services to China, despite many other international postal operators having suspended their China service altogether.
We continue to collect and process items bound for China. In the event traffic received is greater than the daily available air capacity we will hold items on site in our Heathrow Hub and forward them for transit to China on the next available flight.
Delays to deliveries in China
As a result of reduced air capacity and emergency delivery procedures being taken to contain the virus on the ground in China, it is inevitable that customers sending items to China are likely to experience delays to delivery.
For international mail (letters, parcels and Express Mail Service items) China Post are contacting the recipient by phone, before delivery, to agree a delivery preference. The recipient has the option for mail to be stored temporarily at the postal outlet, made available for pick-up from the outlet, or delivered to a smart parcel locker or via other non-face-to-face methods. As result of this process, delays are to be expected for inbound international mail to these areas of China.
Impact to items leaving China for delivery in the UK
We are processing items from China for delivery in the UK as usual, though the transit of mail across and through China is affected. A number of international airlines have suspended flights to mainland China, and some border ports in neighbouring countries are also temporarily closed. China Post will temporarily store affected transit mail (air and surface) and will transport it to the destination countries when these transport options are once again available. Delays should be expected in transport and delivery during this period.
As previously advised by the World Health Organization, coronaviruses do not survive for long on objects. It is therefore safe to receive postal items from China, without risk of contracting the new coronavirus. Measures have nevertheless been implemented to ensure the safety of mail processing and postal staff across China.
Other service affecting issues:
Start date: 23 January 2020
End date: 3 February 2020
Incident: Reduced customs operations during Chinese New Year
Due to reduced customs operation over the Chinese New Year period, some gateways into China will not be conducting any customs clearance work for international letters and parcels on 25, 26, 28 & 30 January 2020.
As a result, deliveries into China may experience extended delays during and immediately after this period, due to the possible build-up of letters and parcels waiting to clear customs.

Latest Update: 13 October 2020
End date: Ongoing
Incident: Coronavirus
Update: 13 October 2020The Government of New Zealand has moved the Auckland region down to Alert Level 1 of the national pandemic plan, meaning that all restrictions have been lifted.
However, the alternate route available to New Zealand is still in place - see below - and there may be delays to mail deliveries.
Update: 19 June 2020
There are no delays to letters and parcels leaving the UK for New Zealand. Throughout April and early May we experienced difficulties in accessing consistent air capacity to New Zealand. We now have regular flights via Los Angeles. However, this takes longer than usual, but is a reliable route.
We understand a backlog of traffic was held at Auckland Airport in recent weeks and also in Auckland’s processing centre. Therefore, some customers may experience considerable delays because of the increase in ecommerce volumes coming from the USA, UK and Australia.
This, along with the impact of social distancing being experienced by all logistics companies, may mean customers experience items being delivered out of sequence, so not all traffic is being processed and delivered in date order. This affects all mail, not just that from Royal Mail (UK).
Accordingly, delivery times in April and early May were lengthy, but in May as a whole we saw 50% of Tracked items being delivered in 15 days and a steady reduction in items awaiting clearance into the NZ Post domestic operation. This is a continuously improving situation and NZ Post are stating that once handed to their domestic network, they will deliver items in 5 days. For further updates, please visit the NZ Post website.
Update: 2 June 2020
New Zealand Post has accumulated significant backlogs of mail, particularly for North Island. Customers can expect significant delays while the backlogs are being cleared.

Our air transit routes into the USA are now working well, and we’re flying items daily from the UK. We’re using multiple points of entry on the East and West coast, as well as Miami and Chicago to access the United States Postal Service (USPS) domestic operation.
The USA, like many places around the world is receiving huge mail volumes and has been affected in the same was as all logistics operations with reduced staffing and social distancing requirements which reduce efficiency.
We’re monitoring the movement of mail though all US entry points, and have opted to move some traffic from those where delays are more evident. For further updates, please visit the USPS website.
Update: 11 June 2020 - Chicago Gateway (see below)
Update: 2 June 2020
Mail and parcels are being moved around the USA and managed through many international mail centres across the country. This is outside of the normal operating procedures, and is so the United States Postal Service (USPS) can manage the very high volumes.
Los Angeles - is processing 50% more than they do in Christmas peak period, and are experiencing significant delays.
JFK (New York) & Miami - is up to date and processing normally.
San Fransisco - is handling heavy volumes and have moved international work to domestic mail centres outside of the normal International Mail Centres to cope with high volumes. Customers should expect delays.
Chicago - Significant delays are still being seen through the Chicago gateway. We're diverting traffic away from this gateway in consultation with United States Postal Service.
Customers should expect delays across the USA, some are significant as USPS continues to deal with heavy increases in volumes.
