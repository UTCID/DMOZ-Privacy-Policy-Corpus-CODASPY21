Bruce, Indianapolis, IN“I wanted to thank you for your GREAT products.  I have been buying your products for the first time since this spring from Meijer's Grocery Store, in Indianapolis, IN. My family and I (62 yrs. old), have really gotten into the hobby of Bird Watching from our backyard from our patio.  I have 8 hanging feeders, with a big water fountain, with your variety of products such as your Peanut Delight No melt Suet Dough and so on.  In this summer heat here in Indianapolis, IN, your product does not melt like others.  It is simply amazing in this heat.  We have birds from Woodpeckers, to Finches, to Cardinals, Blue Jays and on and on and on, that we have never ...Bruce, Indianapolis, IN“I wanted to thank you for your GREAT products.  I have been buying your products for the first time since this spring from Meijer's Grocery Store, in Indianapolis, IN.

It is not unusual for one to be totally devoured during a day and whatever falls to the ground, flocks of assorted sparrows, etc., gobble that up as well. Good stuff and lots of fun watching them.”Andrea , Steven and James, too!“We have been using your Hot Pepper Delight in our suet feeders for years now, and I feel remiss in not writing sooner to compliment your wonderful product.  Before we switched to Hot Pepper Delight, the squirrels were eating us out of house and home.  Nothing we did kept them out of our feeders.  Since we started using Hot Pepper Delight, squirrels have not been an issue. Not only has your product saved us money, but it has attracted many new species to our feeders, increasing the enjoyment that we get from watching "our" birds.  Our son, James, takes particular pride in recognizing the different species of birds and letting my husband and me know when our favorites show up for ...George, Pittsburgh, PA“I just wanted to send a "Thank You" to your employees for the quality of the products I have purchased to date. I firmly believe that while most folks readily complain if a product is short of expectations, but I also believe that the folks who make a quality product should be told so when it happens repeatedly. I want to tell you that I have an entire backyard of satisfied customers. The products bring satisfaction to both them and myself. Thanks—Happy New Year and keep up the good work!”Susan, Bedford, KY“We have tried many brands, until my friend sent me one of yours. I got to say the birds loved it. You now have another family of bird watchers and breeders that are very happy with your products. Thanks for making food that wild birds actually like.”Ann, Williamsport, PA“Just want to tell you how great the No Melt Suet Dough is. In the past, only in colder weather would the birds come to the suet cake. Usually it was only the Downey woodpecker, sometimes the white breasted nuthatch. Now, I am happy to say that even in the very hot weather we have been experiencing, I have a vast assortment of birds enjoying your No Melt Suet Dough... and very happy with your products.”Laura & Rita“Just a quick note to let you know that the backyard birds just love your C&S brand Peanut Dough! As a matter of fact, the Starlings and Redwings raised a six hour long fit, including banging on the windows and sitting on the fence (10 in a row), until we bought some more. All the local stores we go to were sold out, so we had to call around town until we found peanut at a local hardware store. The birds are a little demanding… they won’t eat any brand but yours!!!Linda, Fort Worth, TX“I live in Fort Worth, TX where we have had 100+ temps for 30 and more days. Your No Melt Suet lives up to its name. There has been no melting and the sun shines on our feeder from about 8 am to 6 pm. It is the greatest and thank you for making it so.Peggy, Atlanta, GA“I must tell you how GREAT your product is, the Hot Pepper Suet!!!!!! For years I have bought your other suet cakes and the birds have never been able to enjoy the suet, the squirrels have always depleted the suet before the birds could get to it. I have even had my suet cages disappear, I swear that squirrels are engineers, they find a way to get to everything. Ever since I started buying the Hot Pepper Suet, the squirrels are gone from my yard. I have never had so many birds and so many different kinds of birds. It is now a pleasure for me to feed the birds. Just wanted you to know that the birds and I LOVE ...Olivia, Age 10“My name is Olivia P. and I am a 5th grader. For my science project I compared 3 brands of suet cakes at 3 different houses at least 10 miles apart using the exact same holders at each house. Your Seed and Suet brand was the first to be fully eaten at each house. My conclusion is that birds prefer your brand.”Bruce & Mary, Indianapolis, IN“I cannot tell you HOW much my wife Mary and I and our children and grandchildren have enjoyed just not our Local Birds of Indiana, buy we now have attracted birds of Prey never seen before and I mean NEVER ! We are witnessing Birds from far North of Indiana and East Coast Birds never seen before. I have captured them on our phone. Here in Indianapolis, we have a sanctuary for our American Bald Eagles at Eagle Creek. We have now seen a bunch of them at our Feeders with YOUR Products. How Proud we are to see OUR American Birds and now the Bald Eagles eating YOUR AMERICAN made products and the containers they come in. We have ...Karen, Evansville, IN“Peanut delight log-Great product. After years of feeding meal worms with some success, several minutes after putting out the peanut delight log, I had several bluebirds at one time on it the rest of the day! ! They did not even leave when I was out in the yard nearby, unusual for a normally somewhat shy visitor. I am ecstatic. Thank you for this wonderful product. So happy I purchased.”Lexi, Gretna, VA“For many years I tried to feed suet with no success. The suet would turn rancid and I would have a yucky mess to clean up and throw away. I tried all different brands and flavors... no luck. Then years later a local garden center gave me a recipe for homemade suet. Of course, the birds loved it and I couldn't keep up with their demand!!!! One day I was in a store and saw your Peanut Delight No Melt Suet Dough. I thought it looked very similar to my homemade so I decided to give it a try. The birds loved it!!!! I bulk buy and keep it on hand ALL the time!! It is wonderful and I can feed ...SharonRecently found your peanut suet pellets and peanut suet log in WalMart, I just love the product,(as do the birds) its great,we started feeding the birds to entertain our indoor cats, well, now we spend more time watching than the cats do! So happy that is made in the USA, will continue to use your products.TJ, Normal, ILHello, Just a compliment on one of your products, the Woodpecker No Melt Suet Dough. I put this out 2 days ago, and the woodpeckers & bluejays our loving it. Just to experiment I put a lower priced & quality suet cake & your cake next to it. All the birds our attracted & eating your suet cake and loving it. Its great for me as I get to see the red bellied woodpeckers & downing woodpeckers in my trees come down to enjoy. I just wanted to shoot you an email to let you know how happy I am with your product. Thanks, TJMelissa, Customer for Life!I just had to write to tell you how much our birds LOVE your Peanut Delight Suet Dough.  We can't keep it in the baskets!!! We just started putting up bird feeders and suet baskets this year and the number of birds that gravitate to the suet basket with the Peanut Delight Suet Dough is amazing. We get everything from sparrows to red bellied woodpeckers clamoring to get to the suet baskets. Your product is amazing! Sincerely, Melissa,Customer for life!
Wilson, Lampe, MOPlease consider packaging and selling the " Peanut Suet Nuggets " in a container larger than the current 27 oz. plastic bag. How about 5 or even 10 lbs. ? We cannot keep up with the bird demand for this product in our feeder and would bet other folks who feed this product have the same experience. As fast as we fill the feeder, the birds empty it and they will go thru the entire 27 oz. bag in just two days. No squirrels or other critters can access the feeder so we know it's only visited by birds...Chickadees, Tufted Tit Mouse, three varieties of Woodpecker, White Breasted Nuthatches...you name it, they love it. Thank you for your consideration.Audrey, Boiling Spring Lakes, NCHigh Energy Suet is a great product.  My birds are very happy with it.  Thanks so much.....AudreyJohn, North Haven, CTI just wanted to say that I have been raising chickens and in the last two months have started using your BabyCakes and Ultrakibble for Chicks for both chicks and pullets.  I have noticed all the claims on the package and then some! I work at my local feed store and have tried all of our poultry products personally and find your products to be some of the best, I recommend all you products to my customers and have heard positive feedback from them. Thank you for a good product and making me look good every time I recommend your product.John, Pfafftown, NCI have kept multiple wildlife feeders for years. It provides great pleasure for my family and me as we watch the birds and other wildlife with their antics.
My favorite suet block is the Peanut Delight Suet Dough. No other suet even comes close in popularity by the birds. It is common for them to devour an entire block in one day. Other birders in my area prefer your products too, as often they are sold out. Therefore, when I find a good supply I immediately stock up. Wal-Mart always carries C & S products, but the Peanut Delight sells out quickly. Sadly, very few of the farm and garden stores carry C & S products choosing to stock inferior varieties ...HC, Burnsville, NCLove your quality product -- get at Freds --Keep that USA quality spirit!
