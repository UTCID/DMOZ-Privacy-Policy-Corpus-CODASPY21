Welcome to Rosy Dawn Gardens!
Rosy Dawn Gardens is now accepting orders for shipment in Spring 2021! Order now and reserve your Coleus and choose your desired ship date from April 5 through May 31.
We are a mail-order retail nursery that specializes in colorful Coleus plants suitable for container growing and garden beds in shade or sun. Coleus are grown for their beautiful foliage and are usually treated as an annual in the U.S., but they are actually a tender perennial. Since they don't depend on flowers for color, Coleus will brighten your garden or patio all summer long!
Our unique growing method allows us to provide a sturdy starter plant with a well-formed root system using a minimum amount of growing medium. This allows us to keep shipping costs down and pass the savings along to our customers. Whether you are into shade gardening, container and patio gardening, or growing beautiful garden beds - you have come to the right place!
