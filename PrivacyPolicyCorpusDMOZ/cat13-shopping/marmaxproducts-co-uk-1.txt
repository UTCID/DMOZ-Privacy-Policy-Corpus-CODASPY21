5.5 Goods may be delivered by instalments. Each instalment shall be deemed to be a separate contract, but payments shall be made in accordance with clause 3.4 as a condition precedent to future deliveries. Any delay in delivery shall not entitle the Customer to cancel any other instalment.

6.5 In the event that the Company has to exercise its rights under clause 6.4, the Customer shall fully indemnity the Company for all costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with the exercise of such rights.
7. TERMINATION
