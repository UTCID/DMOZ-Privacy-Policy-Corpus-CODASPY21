Terms and Conditions
VAT---------------------------------T&J Tools do not charge VAT on any transactions.
Security and Privacy---------------------------------
We keep your name, address and telephone number on a computer database together with the last invoice number and date. We will delete these on request at no charge. Please note that for your security we do not keep card details on a computer database and they are not retained on the server. We destroy card details after use. If you ask specially we will keep your card details safely for a while so you can send follow up orders by email. We do not pass your personal details to others without your express permission. We never reveal information to mailing list agencies or advertising agencies.
Online Card Payments----------------------------------
Like most online businesses we comply with very strict regulations designed to prevent your card details falling into the wrong hands. When you pay with a card you are redirected to another website owned by the payment service provider Sagepay. You type card details into their system not ours. They take the money and pass it on to us later. They have very elaborate security in place to protect your card details. Our website never sees your card information so it cannot be stolen from us.
Privacy Policy---------------------
T&J Tools do not disclose buyers' information to third parties other than when order details are processed as part of the order fulfilment. In this case, the third party will not disclose any of the details to any other third party.
Cookies are used on this shopping site to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket. They are also used after you have logged on as part of that process. You can turn off cookies within your browser by going to 'Tools | Internet Options | Privacy' and selecting to block cookies. If you turn off cookies, you will be unable to place orders or benefit from the other features that use cookies.
