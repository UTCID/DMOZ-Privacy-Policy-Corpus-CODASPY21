We have implemented security policies, rules, and technical measures to protect the personal and credit card information under our control from loss, misuse, and alteration.

You also may request a readable copy of the personal information we keep about you, which we will provide to you within a reasonable time period of receiving your request. Although we may require proof of your identity before processing a request, we will provide the information without any charge. We reserve the right to refuse to provide our visitors with a copy of their personal information, but we will give reasons for our refusal.
What Choices Do I Have?
We allow you to challenge the data that we hold about you and, where appropriate, you may have the information erased, corrected, amended, or completed. We allow you to challenge our decision to refuse to provide you with a copy of your personal information.

Children's Privacy
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000. It imposes certain requirements on websites directed at children under 13 that collect information from those children, and on websites that knowingly collect information on children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If a child submits information to us through any part of our website, and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. No one under the age of 15 should submit any personal information to this or any other website without the consent of a parent or guardian.
