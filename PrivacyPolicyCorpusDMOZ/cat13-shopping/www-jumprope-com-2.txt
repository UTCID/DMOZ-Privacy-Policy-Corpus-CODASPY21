Both you and Jumprope acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Jumprope’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.Arbitration Rules. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.Costs of Arbitration.The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Jumprope will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. Jumprope will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.Small Claims Court.Furthermore, either you or Jumprope may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York or any United States county where you live or work.Waiver of Jury Trial.YOU AND JUMPROPE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Jumprope are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Jumprope over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND JUMPROPE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Jumprope is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section (h) below.Opt-out.You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 32 Laight Street, New York, NY 10013 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address; (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.Exclusive Venue.If you send the opt-out notice in Section (g) above, and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Jumprope to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Jumprope agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in New York.Severability.If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Jumprope.MiscellaneousYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Jumprope may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Jumprope agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Jumprope, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Jumprope, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Jumprope in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the Apple Application, you and Jumprope agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.© Jumprope 2020Privacy PolicyTerms of UseAboutCreatorsCareersBlog
