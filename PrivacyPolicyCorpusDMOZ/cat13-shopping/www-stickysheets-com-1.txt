Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have
access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other
direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to fill your order or satisfy a customer service
quest. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our
organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your order or satisfy your request.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell
you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy
policy.
Your Access to and Control Over Information
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the
following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number at
the bottom of this policy:
See what data we have about you,
if any.
Change/correct any data we have
about you.
Have us delete any data we have
about you.
Express any concern you have
about our use of your data.
Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
information via the website, your information is protected both online and
offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data),
that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can
verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web
browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of
the web page. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information
transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees
who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or
customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are
kept in a secure environment.
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you
should contact us immediately via telephone at 88-88-STICKY or via email to
web@stickysheets.com.
