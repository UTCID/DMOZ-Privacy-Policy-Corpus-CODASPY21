Secure ordering
Your online credit card transactions are secure with our commerce system. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe Internet transmission of your personal information. When the letters “http” in the URL change to “https,” the “s” indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you’re about to enter a secure area.
Making a credit card purchase is just as safe on our Web site as it is by telephone, but if you prefer the latter, you may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1-877-472-2672. One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.
Our system does not store credit card data.
Links to other sites
While visiting our site, you may link to Web sites operated by our business partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse these Web sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any Web site you may access through this Web site. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information or activities. You need to make your own independent decisions regarding your interactions or communications with any other Web site.
If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not our privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information.
Online account registration To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with our website. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.
If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.
E-mails
You will receive promotional e-mails from us only if you have asked to receive them. Each time you receive an e-mail from us, you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” or stop receiving them.
If you choose to “opt-out,” we will stop sending you e-mails. Please note, however, that some e-mail promotions are prepared well in advance, so you may continue to receive offers after you have chosen to “opt-out.” We appreciate your patience in giving us time to carry out your request. Call toll-free 1-877-472-2672 or write: Keylan Customer Relations 1951 Wellesley Tr. Atlanta,GA, 30338
Online account registration
When you register with us online checkout is even faster and easier because we secure all your shipping and billing information for your future use — you only have to enter it once. You also can access your order status and history online for both Web and catalog orders.

Canceling an order
If your order has not entered the logistics system, you may cancel it for any reason. Once an order is in process it becomes very difficult to stop or cancel. We will make every effort to work with customers to stop shipments that have not left the building, but this cannot be guaranteed. If you cancel an order that is in process, and we cannot despite every effort, locate it to stop it, we will have no choice but to treat it as an order returned without cause.
