Welcome To Our Website, the home of Barbara-Ann Bears, Andy's Greeting Cards And Our Bear Making Supplies, please make yourself comfortable and have a look around
Barbara Ann Bears, Andy Near The Sea, Wild but Gorgeous... who are we?
We are Barbara and Andy Cunningham and this is the new home for Barbara Ann Bears. Barbara-Ann Bears started in 1990, we've won awards and they've been on TV (Marigold's teddy bear in Downton Abbey was made by us). You will also find our hand dyed mohair, kits, patterns, greeting cards & photos here (eventually!)
Covid 19 update
At the moment we are both healthy,  although Barbara is not allowed out owing to some health conditions that make her vulnerable. We are continuing to make teddy bears. We are able to go to the Post Office which is continuing to operate. The postal service is understandably a little slower and there are no guaranteed delivery times. Please continue to look at and buy things from our website, we couldn't survive long without you and we are eternally grateful for that.Please stay safe and healthy, love and hugsBarbara and Andy
