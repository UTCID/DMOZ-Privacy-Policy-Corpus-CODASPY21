Privacy & Screening Grow a beautiful, living fence line
We all like our privacy, but not everybody likes the look or expense of fencing. There is a beautiful alternative -- trees and shrubs can create a natural barrier of wonderfully attractive foliage and eye-catching blooms. From climbing Hydrangeas, which can cover existing walls or fences to quick-growing Thuja perfect for a perimeter planting, we have something that's just right for your situation and ready to bring beauty that increases each year while providing the privacy you crave!
