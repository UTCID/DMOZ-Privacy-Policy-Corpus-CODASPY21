Home / Privacy Policy
In brief, we don’t share the data that you provide for us...ever! But in case you’re interested, here are the details.
The personal data that we collect and save
We collect personal data (like name, email address, address, and phone number) and save it in our database in these cases:
When you place an order
When you create an account
When you download chapters or applications
When you join our email list
When you post a review for one of our books
We also keep a record of:
The items that you’ve bought
The items that you’ve returned
The items that you’ve downloaded
When you place an order, we also collect but do not save:
Credit card information
As soon as the order has been processed, the credit-card data is destroyed.
How we use the data that we collect
We only use the data that we collect in ways that we think will improve your experiences with us. That includes:
Processing and tracking your orders
Sending you information about special orders and promotions
Sending you updates about products you have purchased
With every email, you will have the chance to “unsubscribe” to future emails.
What data we share with others
We have never shared the information in our database with third-parties...ever...and see no reason to do so in the future.
The only exceptions, which have never happened, would be if we were required to do so by law or believed that an action was ethically necessary. For example, we might have to provide personal data:
To comply with a legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order.
Or to protect against the misuse or unauthorized use of our website.
How we secure your data
Our goal is to protect the data that we collect from you against loss, misuse, or alteration. To do that, we use a variety of technologies and practices. For instance:
When you make a purchase, create an account, or join our email list, your information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format.
We maintain the data you provide, along with a record of your purchases, in a secure database.
We don’t save the credit card information that you provide for an order.
Occasionally, our website provides links to other websites that we think you might find useful.
Note, however, that these sites operate independently and have their own privacy and security policies, over which we have no control.
About our links to other sites

What about policy changes
If our privacy policy changes, which is unlikely, we will post the changes on our web site. That’s why you may want to periodically review our privacy policy.
