For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” shall mean
individually
identifiable
information

Please see our Privacy Provisions for California Residents below for
details regarding our use and sharing of personal information.
Nuts.com will never share, sell, rent, exchange or barter your personal information to or with any third-party
for financial gain or marketing purposes. By making your personal information available to Nuts.com, you grant
Nuts.com the right, subject to applicable law, to use that personal information (other than Sensitive
Information) to contact you by telephone and email regarding your use of the Site Offerings (including in
connection with any purchase of Nuts.com Products). If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us,
please follow the instructions at the end of each such marketing message or see the
"Opt-Out/Unsubscribe"

Nuts.com products and/or services, as well as third-party products and/or services that we think may be of
interest to you. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please follow the instructions at
the end of each such marketing message or use any of the other options available in the
“Opt-Out/Unsubscribe”
section below.
Where you submit personal information, we use the personal information that you make available to facilitate
the delivery of the applicable Site Offerings to you, including to respond to any inquiries made by you. You
also agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem
appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of the Site Offerings, and to keep you
informed of our other products and services.
We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include
processing credit card and other payment transactions, sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate
information from User lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these
limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our Users' personal information (including Sensitive
Information, where applicable) as needed to perform these functions for us, but we do not permit them to use
User personal information for other purposes.
We will also use your personal information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may
request, to customize your experience with the Site Offerings and/or to contact you for market research
purposes. We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and
managing our service offerings including, without limitation, the Site Offerings. We may also combine the
information we have gathered about you with information from other sources.
By submitting your personal information by and through the Site Offerings, you agree that such act constitutes
an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as
amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call
regulations. As such,
notwithstanding
that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on
applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the
Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.
Where you provide “prior express consent” within the meaning of the Telephone
Consumer
Protection Act (47 USC §
227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as
amended from time-to-time (“TCPA”), you consent to receive, from Nuts.com,
telephone calls,
including artificial
voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls (including text alerts via SMS text messages delivered via
automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to
provide this consent in order to obtain access to the Site Offerings, and your consent simply allows Nuts.com to
contact you via these means. Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are
obligated to
immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes.
Without
limiting the foregoing, if you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another person or entity; (b)
give
up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (c) port your telephone number to a landline or
vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively “Phone
Number
Change”), you agree that you shall promptly notify Nuts.com of the Phone Number Change via e-mail
at:
care@nuts.com, or by using one of the methods set forth in the
“Contact Us” section
below.
We reserve the right to release current or past personal information (including Sensitive Information): (i) in
the event that we believe that the Site Offerings are being or have been used in violation of the Terms and
Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (ii) if the information is subpoenaed; provided, however, that, where
permitted by applicable law, we shall provide you with e-mail notice, and opportunity to challenge the subpoena,
prior to disclosure of any personal information pursuant to a subpoena; or (iii) if we are sold, merge with a
third-party, are acquired or are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that if Nuts.com is
involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
notified via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
information, as well as any choices that you may have regarding your personal information.
You hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole
discretion, determine the disclosure to be required by applicable law, including sharing your e-mail address
with third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to
time, and other e-mail marketing laws. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy
Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or
transferred to third-parties without permission.
Credit and/or Debit Card Transactions

If you choose to purchase Nuts.com Products, the credit or debit card information provided will be shared with
our contracted third-party payment processing service provider(s). Nuts.com requires that its third-party
payment processing service provider(s) has/have in place privacy policies and practices consistent with this
Privacy Policy; provided, however, that we cannot guarantee the privacy practices of our third-party payment
processing service provider(s).
Non-Personal Information Collection and Use
Please see our Privacy Provisions for California Residents below for
more details regarding the categories and types of non-personal information collected.
Computer IP Addresses/Browser Type
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you and your desktop computer when you
visit many of the pages of the Site. This non-personally identifiable information includes, without limitation,
the type of browser that you use (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer), your IP address, the type of
operating system that you use (e.g., Windows or iOS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider

Cookies
When a User visits the Site, we send one (1) or more cookies and/or gif files (collectively,
"Cookies") to
assign

Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all
Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. To disable and reject certain Cookies, follow the
instructions associated with your Internet browser. Even in the case where a User rejects a Cookie, he or she
may still use the Site Offerings; provided, however, that certain functions of the Site Offerings may be
impaired or rendered inoperable if the use of Cookies is disabled. We reserve the right to retain Cookie data
indefinitely.
Behavioral Tracking
Nuts.com and its third-party partners use Cookies, pixels and other tracking technology (collectively,
"Tracking
Technology") to analyze trends, administer the Site, track Users' movements around the Site and to gather
demographic information about our User base as a whole. In addition, we partner with third-parties such as
Facebook to use Tracking Technology in connection with the serving of our advertising to you on other websites
when you exit the Site. Our third-party partners may use Tracking Technology to gather information about your
activities on the Site and other websites in order to provide you with certain Nuts.com advertising based upon
your browsing activities and interests.
Users may be able to disable some, but not all, of this tracking activity by utilizing the "Do Not
Track"

form of tracking utilizing the options made available by the Network Advertising Initiative,
Facebook or Digital

tracking activity does not opt you out of being served advertising. Even where you opt out of this tracking
activity, you will continue to receive generic ads.
Cross Device Tracking
Nuts.com tracks Users' use of the Site Offerings across various devices, including your personal computer and
mobile device, in order to optimize and personalize your Site Offerings experience. Nuts.com may collect certain
of your personal information across various devices. Please be advised that where you opt-out of having your use
of the Site Offerings tracked across devices, you may need to upload certain information multiple times and/or
input your log-in information multiple times.
Aggregate Data
Nuts.com reserves the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data about Users of the Site Offerings
for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage and other
characteristics of Users as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information.
Social Media Websites
If you engage in any interaction with Nuts.com, other Users or any third-party on any Social Media Pages, you
should be aware that: (a) the personal information that you submit by and through such Social Media Pages can be
read, collected and/or used by other Users of these websites/services (depending on your privacy settings
associated with your accounts with the applicable Social Media Websites), and could be used to send you
unsolicited messages or otherwise to contact you without your consent or desire; and (b) where Nuts.com responds
to any interaction on such Social Media Pages, your account name/handle may be viewable by any and all
members/Users of Nuts.com's social media accounts. We are not responsible for the personal information that you
choose to submit on any Social Media Websites.
Your interactions with the Social Media Pages are governed by the privacy policies of the applicable Social
Media Websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings of the Social Media Pages with
which you interact to help you understand those Social Media Websites' respective privacy practices. If you have
questions about the security and privacy settings of any Social Media Pages that you use, please refer to the
applicable Social Media Website's privacy notices or policies.
Third-Party Websites
This Site may contain links to third-party owned and/or operated websites including, without limitation, Social
Media Websites, as well as the websites of other third parties. Nuts.com is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of such websites. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of
these third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a
credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have
separate privacy and data collection practices and Nuts.com has no responsibility or liability relating to them.
Security of Your Personal Information
We endeavor to safeguard and protect our Users' personal information. When Users make personal information
available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain
any personal information offline). Where our registration/application process prompts Users to enter Sensitive
Information (such as medical information, driver's license/ID card number, health insurance information, data
collected from an automated license plate recognition system, Social Security Number and credit card
information), and when we store and transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is encrypted with
advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable security measures to ensure that
your personal information is not accessible to the public. All of our Users' personal information is restricted
in our offices, as well as the offices of our third-party service providers. Only employees or third-party
agents who need User personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to User personal
information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User personal information.
Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. The servers that we store User
personal information on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to
protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.
Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no
storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet or via
wireless networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures
may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches
may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach
the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime
punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be
absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site, other Site Offerings or otherwise via the
Internet or wireless networks, is done at your own risk.
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory
agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information.
You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in
order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial
measures.
Children's Privacy
Please see our Privacy Provisions for California Residents below for
more details regarding the personal information of minors.
Visitors under eighteen (18) years of age are not permitted to use and/or submit their personal information at
the Site. Nuts.com does not knowingly solicit or collect information from visitors under eighteen (18) years of
age.

instructions on how California Residents can access and/or delete personal information that we have collected.
At your request, we will: (a) inform you of what personal information we have on file for you; (b) amend the
personal information that we have on file for you; and/or (c) remove personal information that you have provided
to us, or that we have otherwise collected. You may do so by e-mailing us at: care@nuts.com. We ask individual
Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests
that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the
privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on
backup tapes).
Please be advised that deleting your personal information may terminate your access to certain of the Site
Offerings. If you wish to continue using the full complement of Site Offerings, you may not be able to delete
all of the personal information that we have on file for you.
Please be further advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a period of
time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
Transfer of Personal Information Internationally
If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your
communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting
the Site and/or otherwise communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers. Even if your
jurisdiction does not have the same privacy laws as the jurisdiction where our servers are located, we will
treat your information as subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Nuts.com reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a notice on the Site
that we are changing our Privacy Policy. If the manner in which we use personal information changes, Nuts.com
will notify Users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our Users via e-mail; and/or (b) by any other

Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and
retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable CA User request, we will
delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our (their) records, unless
an exception applies; provided, however, that in some cases, strictly for regulatory compliance purposes and to
better evidence/honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests (and for no other purposes), we may retain certain items of
your personal information on a de-identified and aggregated basis in such a manner that the data no longer
identifies you.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you
requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with
you, or otherwise perform our obligations in connection with our contract/relationship with you.

those responsible for such activities.

exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that
adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render
impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, but only if you previously provided informed
consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with CA User expectations based on your relationship
with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you
provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights
To exercise your access, data portability and/or deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable CA
User request to us by either:
Clicking here: https://nuts.com/ccpa-privacy-rights-request;
Calling us at: 1-800-558-6887;
Emailing us at: care@nuts.com; or
Sending us U.S. mail to: Nuts.com, 125 Moen St., Cranford, NJ 07016.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf,
may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.
You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable CA User request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the person about whom we
collected personal information; or (2) an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to
it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable CA
User request does not require that you create an account with us.  We will only use personal information
provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof.
If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in
writing.  We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures that
we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request.  The
response that we provide will also explain the reasons that we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For
data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable
and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive,
repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we
made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we
will not:
Deny you goods or services;
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other
benefits, or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; and/or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality
of goods or services.
