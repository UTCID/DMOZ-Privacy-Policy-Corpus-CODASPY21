Cookies, Web Beacons and other Information We Collect by Automated Means
1.13 We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors and understand what products and services you might prefer. We collect this information through various means, such as “cookies” and “web beacons.”
Cookies Like many companies, we use “cookies” on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping bag between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular.
Web Beacons Certain pages on this website contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are often used in combination with cookies. We use them for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed. Unlike cookies, you cannot decline web beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies or to prompt you for a response will keep web beacons from tracking your activity.
Performance Tools We may use performance tools such as Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website. Google Analytics tools, including cookies and web beacons, allow us to collect information such as the state/country of residence and zip code/postcode from which our visitors come and the IP addresses of our visitors' computers. You can opt out of aggregation and analysis of data collected by companies like Google Analytics.
1.14 To find out more about the way we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and how to manage your settings and preferences, please visit our Cookie Policy.
Customer Assistance
1.15 You may call our customer service line for information about our products or personal shopping advice. If you do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and, if you choose to make a purchase, your payment card information. We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction.
Third Party Sources
1.16 In addition to the ways we collect information about you described above, we also may obtain information about you from third parties (for example, our sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services via PayPal. We will share information with such service providers only to the extent necessary for them to provide their relevant service (in this instance, processing payments made via our website, refunding such payments and dealing with complaints and queries relating to such payments and refunds).
1.17 We may also use your personal information to provide you with products or services you request (such as tailoring services or processing returns), enhance your shopping experience and communicate with you about our products, services and promotions.
1.18 In addition, we may use your personal information for internal purposes, such as fraud and theft prevention, accident reporting, development and administration of our sites and stores, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.
2. HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
3. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
3.1 All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted.
3.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
