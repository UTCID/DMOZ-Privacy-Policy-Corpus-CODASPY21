Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy ("Privacy
Policy") explains how Office Designs, LLC ("Office Designs,"
"we" or "us" ) collects and processes the information that
you share when you use this website (the "Site") through a computer
or mobile device (collectively, the "Service").
Before providing your information to the
Service, please read this Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Service,
you accept the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do
not want us to collect and process information about you, please do not submit it
and do not access or use the Service.
We do not intentionally collect any Personally
Identifiable Information from children under thirteen (13) years of age. Where
any such information is inadvertently collected, we will delete the information
as soon as possible. If you believe a child under thirteen (13) years of age has
provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us.
Information We Collect
We collect certain information that you
share with us, including:
Personally Identifiable Information:
"Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" is
information that can personally identify you, such as your name, email
address and telephone number. We may retain your Personally Identifiable
Information as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Service. What
specific Personally Identifiable Information we collect depends on how you
use the Service. Providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us
is your choice. Be aware, however, that if you choose not to provide us
with certain Personally Identifiable Information, you may not be able to
take advantage of certain features of the Service.
General Information: When you
visit the Service, we may collect various categories of general non-Personally
Identifiable Information ("General Information"). General
Information includes browser information, operating system information,
device information, TCP-IP address and the date, time, length of stay and
specific pages accessed during your visits to the Service.
Registering for the Service or Creating an
Account
If you register to use the Service or
create an account we may collect Personally Identifiable Information including
your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number and other
information that you provide to us.
You may review, update, or modify your
account information, including profile and contact information, at any time by
logging into your Office Designs account.
Online Identification Tools
We may use your IP address to help identify
and solve issues with our server and provide you with a better web browsing experience.
We may use your IP address to identify you, your shopping cart and wish list
and to collect General Information.
We use cookies to keep track of your items
in your cart and wish list and for other purposes such as personalizing the
Service. A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your
computer. By default, your web browser is set up to accept cookies. If you change
the settings to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your
account, cart, wish list or to personalize the content that you see.
Do Not Track Signals
Some web browsers incorporate a "Do
Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to a website that
a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website
that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser
can block that website from collecting certain information. Not all browsers offer
a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. Thus, the Site may not
recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Third Party Features
The Service also may include social media
buttons and widgets, such as the Facebook or Twitter "Like" button. Clicking
on these buttons will take you to third party website. These third party
websites may collect and display your Personally Identifiable Information, your
IP address and the page you are visiting on the Service and may set a cookie to
enable the feature to function properly. These features may be hosted by a
third party and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy
of the third party that provides the feature.
Third-Party Links
We may provide links to third-party websites
that we do not own or control, for example, to social media websites and websites
operated by manufacturers of products we sell. We are not responsible for the information
collection practices of any website that we do not own or control. The privacy
practices of third-party websites are solely their responsibility.
How Your Personally Identifiable
Information is Used, Processed and Disclosed
Except as specified in this Privacy
Policy, Office Designs does not rent, sell, trade or disclose your Personally
Identifiable Information to third parties without your prior consent. Office
Designs may, however, use, process and disclose Personally Identifiable
Information to:
send information to customers about
orders;
fulfill your orders;
process and collect your payments;
send you promotional marketing
material about Office Designs' company and partners;
customize, analyze, adjust and
improve the Service to better meet your needs;
enforce Office Designs' agreements
with you;
provide you with important
administrative information regarding the Service, such as changes to this
Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and other policies;
prevent fraud and other prohibited or
illegal activities; and
comply with potential requests of law
enforcement or data protection agencies.
We may combine and/or link General
Information with Personally Identifiable Information.
Information about customers is considered
an asset of Office Designs and, as such, may be transferred to another company
as part of a merger or acquisition.
We may use your General Information and Personally
Identifiable Information that has been stripped of personally identifiable
information to prepare anonymized, aggregated data about our users
("Anonymized Data"). We may provide third parties with Anonymized
Data in describing the Service to prospective partners, advertisers and other
third parties, and for any other lawful purposes. As communicated to third
parties, the Anonymized Data will not include any information permitting the
recipient to identify, locate or contact you.
Third Party Service Providers
Office Designs employs other companies and
individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders,
delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, providing search results
and links, processing credit card payments, and other services. These
third-party service providers have access to Personally Identifiable
Information needed to perform their functions but are contractually obligated not
to use it for any other purpose.
User-Generated Content
The Site permits the submission of
user-generated content, such as chat sessions and product reviews, generated by
you and others users ("User Content").
You are solely responsible for your own
User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. Any User Content
or other material, information or ideas that you submit to or post or publish
on the Site is non-confidential and non-proprietary. Office Designs may retain
copies of User Content indefinitely.
By submitting User Content, you represent
and warrant to Office Designs that: (i) your User Content does not violate any
copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent or other intellectual property
right, any right of privacy or publicity of any third party or any applicable
law, rule or regulation, (ii) you own or have the legal right to use and
authorize Office Designs to use your User Content, including written consent to
use of any product or the name, voice, likeness or any other applicable
personal rights of each identifiable person featured or referenced in your User
Content and (iii) your User Content does not violate Office Designs' Acceptable
Use Policy.
As between you and Office Designs, you
will retain all of your ownership rights in and to your User Content. By
submitting User Content to Office Designs, however, you hereby grant to Office
Designs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free,
sublicensable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, distribute,
edit, modify, translate, reformat, prepare derivative works based upon, display
publicly, perform publicly and otherwise exploit (including but not limited to
over the Internet or any other uses or media) your User Content, in whole or in
part, including future rights that Office Designs (or its successor) may
otherwise become entitled to that do not yet exist, as well as new uses, media,
means and forms of exploitation throughout the universe exploiting current or
future technology yet to be developed to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. You also hereby grant each user of the Site a non-exclusive
license to access your User Content through the Site and to use, access, watch,
reproduce, distribute, transmit, forward, display and perform such User Content
in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by the Site under these Terms of
Use.
Office Designs does not endorse any User
Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein. Office
Designs reserves the right but is not obligated to monitor User Content or
other content sent to or through the Site. Office Designs has the right to
refuse, remove or delete any User Content and/or to terminate any user's access
to the Site if Office Designs determines, in its sole and absolute discretion,
that such User Content or user violates or has violated these Terms of Use.
Office Designs takes no responsibility for and expressly disclaims any and all
liability in connection with User Content.
Reviews
The Service may from time to time offer
publicly-accessible customer reviews. Any information you provide in these
areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request
removal of your Personally Identifiable Information from blogs, customer
reviews or forums, please contact us. Please note that
in some cases we may be unable to remove your Personally Identifiable
Information.
Retention of Personally Identifiable
Information
Office Designs retains Personally
Identifiable Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use, unless a longer
retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.
Accessing and Updating Your Personally
Identifiable Information and Preferences
Modifying or Deleting Your Personally
Identifiable Information
If you would like to modify or delete your
Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us with clear
instructions about what you would like to be modified or deleted. We will
respond to your request promptly.
Changing Your Subscription Preferences
If you tell us that you do not want us to
use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you, Office Designs
will respect your wishes. If you are a registered user, you may change your
preferences to receive or not to receive email or other communications from us
by logging in to your account and indicating those preferences on the "My
Account" section of our Service.
You may also instruct Office Designs to
stop sending you emails, newsletters or other information by following the
‘unsubscribe’ instructions provided in the email. Office Designs may, however,
continue to use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you to
service your account or as otherwise authorized by law. Please note that if you
use more than one name or e-mail address when communicating with Office Designs
or using the Service, you may continue to receive communications from Office
Designs to any name and/or email address not specified in your opt-out request.
Information for Visitors From California
and Outside of the United States
California Residents
California law permits individuals who
provide Office Designs with Personally Identifiable Information and who are
California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of
Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their direct marketing
purposes. To request this information, please contact us.
Visitors from Outside of the United States
The Service is hosted in the United
States. The Site is intended for users who reside in the United States of
America. Office Designs only sells product to addresses in the United States. If
you are visiting the Service from outside the United States, your information
may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States in accordance
with this Privacy Policy and applicable US laws. Please note that data protection
and other applicable laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as
those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data
protection or consumer protection laws in your country. By using the Service,
you consent to transfer of your information to our facilities as described in
this Privacy Policy.
Information Security
We have instituted reasonable safeguards
to help ensure that information collected on the Site is secure. We also take
reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who work with us to make the Site
available to you agree to protect Personally Identifiable Information that they
must access in order to serve you and to honor your preferences about contacts
you receive.
When you send or otherwise transmit your
sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to or though the Site,
your sensitive information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current
industry-standard encryption protocol. We do not store your credit card
information. When you are on an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock
appears at the bottom or top of some web browsers. Alternatively, check the URL
or address of the page. Secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with
"https://" instead of "http://".
Nonetheless, it is possible for third
parties to access information despite our efforts. Without limiting the terms
of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that your use
of the Site and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we
are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you
may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing
security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Site.
You also understand that any information provided by you or collected by us or
our agents in connection with your use of the Site will be used in the manner
described in our Terms of Use. Please do not use the Site if you do not agree
to the terms and conditions described in this Information Security section.
If you have any questions about security
of the Site, please contact us.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy
Policy to reflect changes in our practices. The modified Privacy Policy will be
effective immediately upon posting on the Service. Your continued use of the
Service after the posting of the modified Privacy Policy constitutes your
agreement to abide and be bound by it. If we make any material change, we will
notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or
by means of a notice on this Service prior to the change becoming effective. We
encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on
our privacy practices. If you object to any modification, your sole recourse is
to stop using the Service.

Designs' Copyright Policy
This Copyright Policy describes Office Designs'
policy of prohibiting any information or materials that violate another party's
intellectual property rights from appearing on the Site.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for a copyright owner who
believes that material appearing on the Internet infringes his, her or its
rights under U.S. copyright law. Office Designs complies with the DMCA by
responding to notices and counter-notices that meet the then-current DMCA
requirements. Current DMCA requirements may be found at
http://www.copyright.gov/.
Notification of Alleged Copyright
Infringement
If you have a good faith belief that
material appearing on the Site infringes your copyright, you (or your agent)
may send Office Designs a written notification pursuant to the DMCA (a "DMCA
Notice"). Your DMCA Notice should be sent to our Copyright Agent
(identified below), contain all of the information listed below (and as further
set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and request that the material be removed or
that access to it be blocked. Your DMCA Notice must contain:
1. Identification in sufficient detail of
the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted
works on the Site are covered by a single notification, you may provide a
representative list of such works on the Site; however, the representative list
must contain sufficient detail for each of the copyrighted works so that we can
identify them;
2. Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Site that
contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must
provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the
alleged infringing material and comply with your request to remove or deny
access to the material;
3. Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);
4. The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a
person authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf;
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material on
the Site as you have described in the DMCA Notice is not authorized by the
copyright owner or its agent or the law; and
6. A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information
contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner
or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
that is allegedly infringed.
You must submit any notification of an
alleged copyright infringement to Office Designs' Copyright Agent by mail or
email as set forth below:
Office Designs Copyright Agent
Attn: Legal
722 Landwehr Road
Northbrook, IL 60062
Email: customercare@officedesigns.com (Re: "Office
Designs DMCA Notice")
If you fail to comply with all of the
above requirements, your DMCA Notice will not be valid. Please note that you
may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys' fees, if you
materially misrepresent that materials on the Site are infringing a copyright.
Counter Notification
If you believe in good faith that your own
copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of mistake or
misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification letter to Office
Designs' Copyright Agent pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To
be an effective counter notification under the DMCA, your written
correspondence must include substantially the following:
1. Identification of the material that has
been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before
it was removed or disabled;
2. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district
court in which your address is located or the federal district court for Northbrook,
Illinois if your address is outside the United States;
3. A statement that you will accept service of process from the party that
filed the notification of alleged copyright infringement or the party's agent;
4. Your name, address and telephone number;
5. A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that you have a good
faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result
of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled, or
that the material identified by the complaining party has been removed or
disabled at the URL or web location and will no longer be shown or accessible;
and
6. Your physical or electronic signature.
You may submit your counter notification
to Office Designs' Copyright Agent by mail or email as set forth below:
Office Designs Copyright Agent
Attn: Legal Department
722 Landwehr Road
Northbrook, IL 60062
Email: customercare@officedesigns.com (please reference
"Office Designs DMCA Notice")
Upon receipt of a counter notice, Office Designs'
Copyright Agent may send a copy of it to the original complaining party
informing that party that Office Designs may replace the removed content or
cease disabling it. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against Office Designs, the removed content may be replaced or access to
it restored by Office Designs.
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply
with all of the above requirements, your DMCA counter notification will not be
valid. Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or
removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable
for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.
