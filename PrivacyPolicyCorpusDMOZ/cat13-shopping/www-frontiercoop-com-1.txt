For example, we collect information when you become an associate member; create an online account or profile; use the interactive areas and features of our Stores; make a purchase; sign up for or participate in contests, promotions, surveys, mailing lists, classes, events; and when you email, call, or otherwise communicate with us.

In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a gift card for someone and request that we deliver it electronically or decide to purchase and ship products to someone.  We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send marketing communications to your contacts unless they separately consent to receive these types of communications from us.
Information We Collect Automatically. We may also automatically collect information about you when you access or use the Stores or transact business with us, including:

Information We Collect from Other Sources. We may also receive information about you from other sources and combine or link that with information we have about you.

We may share personal information about you outside of Frontier and its affiliates, including as follows:
with third parties who complete transactions or perform Stores on our behalf;

in connection with, or during negotiations of, a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, joint venture, corporate reorganization, insolvency or bankruptcy, financing or sale of company assets;
in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
to enforce our agreements, policies, and Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Frontier, our members and associate members, our customers, or any other persons; and with your consent.
We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
Social Sharing Features

Third Party Advertising, Analytics and Stores
We allow third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics Stores. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Stores and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Frontier and these third parties to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Stores and other websites, and better understand your online activity.

We also collect, use and post product reviews on our Stores.  When you submit a product review, you become subject to the terms of use and privacy policy. The reviews you submit may be posted on our Stores and even on third-party sites.
Your California Privacy Rights
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Frontier qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please call Customer Service.

Frontier may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the Effective Date above and, in some cases we may but are not required to provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Policy to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
