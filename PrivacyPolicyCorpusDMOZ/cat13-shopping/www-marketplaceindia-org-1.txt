If you purchase a gift card for another person, we may also collect personal information concerning the recipient in order to fulfill your request.
We will assume that you have the recipient's permission to use his or her information for this limited purpose.
If you participate in a promotion or survey or make inquiries concerning our merchandise or service, we may also register personal data.
If you are referred to us through a third-party marketing promotion, we receive personal information.
When you save your information with us online or visit our site, we collect information (Cookies).
In addition, for each visitor to the website, our web server automatically collects the following non-personally identifiable information: your Internet service provider's address, the referring URL, and information on the pages you access on our site.
How we may use the personal information we collect
We use your personal information in a variety of ways related to a purchase.
We process, track and fulfill your order using this information, and we can use it to contact you about the status of your order.

if you consent to join our mailing list, we use your information to send you emails, catalogs or other marketing materials about our merchandise or services.

We may also use your personal information in other ways for which we will provide notice and obtain your consent at the time of collection, to the extent required by law or this privacy policy.
Sharing information with third parties
We may share relevant personal information with companies who provide certain services to us such as shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, and promotions management.

Our site uses "cookies" which are small data files stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you visit a site. Cookies may be used in a variety of ways to enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience.

We will only request such information during secure transactions on our site.
