CCPA Policy
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
Your California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 Rights
Lamps Plus takes your privacy very seriously. As part of our privacy policy, we follow the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), a new law that gives rights to California state residents, known as 'consumers'. For more information read the CCPA law, or visit the State of California Department of Justice website.
Under the CCPA, a 'sale' means providing a third-party personal information for valuable consideration without accounting for the data's safe harbor.
'Safe Harbor', means that the third-party guarantees safe practices of using personal information and will not store, collect, or use your personal data for any purpose beyond fulfilling the obligations of the contract with Lamps Plus. 'Sale' does not mean money was exchanged for the data, instead it includes the sharing and disclosure of personal information. We have taken extensive steps to identify whether any of our personal information sharing arrangements would constitute a 'sale' under the CCPA. Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we will continue to evaluate some of our third-party relationships as we wait for final implementing regulations and guidance. For example, it is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under the CCPA.
Requesting Information
The CCPA gives consumers the right to request the disclosure of any or all of their personal information collected and shared in the previous twelve months before the time of request. The CCPA also grants consumers the right to delete information and opt-out of the sharing of information with third-party marketers. Taking such action will not have any discriminatory impact on any past, present, or future interaction or business transaction with Lamps Plus, such as pricing, or denial of services or requests.
Please note that if you request information be deleted for the previous twelve months from the time of request, as specified in the law, your order-transactional information about you will still be retained so that we can provide services such as shipping your order, fulfilling warranties, maintaining an order history for your reference, or retaining information in cases of fraud, defense and prosecution.
We will acknowledge a CCPA request within 10 days, and respond to your request within 45 days. If that is not possible due to the complexity or number of requests, we will inform you of any delays.
Note that CCPA requests require sufficient identity verification. In order to identify your records and correspond with you, we require that you provide your Email Address and Phone Number.
If, after a request for information or deletion of information, our records do not contain sufficient information to verify your identity, we may not be able to process your request and will let you know accordingly. Depending on the type of request, we might require that you confirm the request by verifying the associated email address.
To submit your CCPA request, click here and fill out the form. You may also call us, toll-free, at 844-503-1057.
