Shipping Policy
You can trust that your order will be quickly processed and safely delivered.
We can ship products anywhere in the United States using the shipping method of your choice. When you place an order we will estimate delivery dates based upon the availability of your item(s), shipping method selected and your shipment’s destination.
Items in stock, for orders placed prior to 12:00pm, will typically ship the same business day. Any delay will be communicated via email or phone.
Our shipping charges are determined by the weight and size of your order and shipping method selected, excluding applicable sales tax.
Returns Policy
If you need to send back a new and unused part within 30 days, we will refund 100% of the purchase price if accompanied by the original invoice. Refunds will be made back to the credit card used for the purchase only. Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer. Products must be in new condition and unopened in the original packaging. Items that need repackaging are subject to a 15% repackaging fee.
In addition, all returns are subject to inspection. Any part, that in our opinion, shows evidence of being used or installed contrary to manufacturer’s instructions and/or subjected to improper handling, packaging, or shipping by the customer will not be eligible for exchange, refund, or warranty consideration. We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee at our sole discretion.
QRC Inc. cannot accept returns of custom ordered parts.
