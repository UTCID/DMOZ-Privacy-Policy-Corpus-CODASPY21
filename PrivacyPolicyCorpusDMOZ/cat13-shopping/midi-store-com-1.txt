My Rewards - 5% towards your next purchase!
Here's how it works:
Create an account here. (You need to have an account to keep track of your purchases and points.) 	You get 5% of the value of your purchase (merchandise only, shipping and/or tax are not included) in points to use on a future order.
Once you've placed your order and it has shipped, your MyRewards Points will be available for you to redeem in 7 days.
To view your available or pending points, simply login and go to MyRewards in your account.
To redeem your points, enter the total amount (in points) and click the Redeem Now button.
Upon placing your order, your available MyRewards will automatically be deducted from the total purchase amount.
If you do not have enough points for the entire purchase amount you can use your available points and complete your purchase with a credit card or PayPal. Your points never expire, you can save them up for one big purchase, or use them on your next order, you decide!
Price Match Policy
The Midi Store LLC will make every effort
to price match with another US dealer based on the following criteria;
the price must be advertised online by an authorized dealer,
the item
must be in stock
at that dealer, the item must be new, not a store demo,
B stock, or used. All our items ship free, so shipping costs charged by
another dealer will be considered part of the price.
We will also try to match prices from
authorized dealers that are using coupons, one day deals (i.e. "stupid
deal of the day" or similar) or from eBay, Amazon or other similar web
sites.
We reserve the right not to match a price from any published source if it is below our current dealer cost. We will NOT match any prices displayed for pick up in a retail store only (they must be shown and available for purchase online), from any dealers outside the US, or if the legitimacy of the website cannot be verified.
