General Terms and Conditions of Use Your use of Web sites and other mobile applications, content and services (collectively, the "Service") made available by David's Bridal, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, David's Bridal Canada Inc, a Canadian national corporation, and their respective divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "David's Bridal", "we", "us", or "our") is subject to the terms of a legal contract between you and David's Bridal. These General Terms and Conditions of Use ("General Terms") explain how the legal contract between you and David's Bridal is made and sets out the terms of that contract. 1. Agreement to Terms. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, your contract with us always includes the General Terms. To the extent any area within the Service contains specific terms and conditions concerning its use ("Specific Terms"), your contract with David's Bridal will also include those Specific Terms. To the extent there is a direct conflict between the General Terms and the Specific Terms, the Specific Terms shall prevail. Together, the General Terms and Specific Terms, if any (collectively, the "Terms"), form the legal and binding contract between you and David's Bridal. Because the Terms are a legally binding contract, you should carefully read them before accessing or using the Service. You may not use the Service if you do not accept the Terms. By clicking to accept or agree to the Terms or by using the Service, you agree to comply with the Terms and all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service and your purchases on the Service. If you do not want to be bound by these Terms, please do not use the Service. These Terms and the information provided in the Service do not modify or supersede the terms and conditions of your purchase of any product or service from David's Bridal except as specifically provided in these Terms. 2. Privacy.
You understand that it may be necessary for us to collect personal information about you. In doing so, David’s Bridal promises to respect and safeguard the privacy of your personal information as set forth in David’s Bridal Privacy Policy, available at www.davidsbridal.com/Content_Legal_privacy, as modified by us from time to time. In most cases, we will rely on your consent to process your personal information. You may indicate your consent in a number of ways, including, as permitted by law, ticking a box (or equivalent action) to indicate your consent when (i) providing us with your personal information through our Services or a form (including enrolling in Promotions); or (ii) registering or creating an account with us. You consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with our privacy policy, available at http://www.davidsbridal.com/Content_Legal_privacy, as modified by us from time to time. In some cases, we will directly ask for your consent to process your personal information. You understand and agree that when you volunteer personal information about yourself you are providing David’s Bridal with affirmative consent to collect the personal information about you. You may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app preferences. Depending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work. For more information about the information we collect and about how to manage your preferences and/or withdraw consent, please see our Privacy Policy. 3. Modification of Terms.
David's Bridal shall have right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise these Terms or to impose new terms and conditions with respect to access to or use of the Service. Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any means, including, but not limited to, posting the revised or additional terms and conditions at www.davidsbridal.com or providing notice through the Service. You should check this Web page periodically for any modification to these Terms. By using the Service after we post changes to these Terms, you agree to accept those changes, whether or not you actually reviewed them. No modification to these Terms by any party other than David's Bridal shall be enforceable against David's Bridal unless expressly agreed to by David's Bridal in writing. 4. Discontinued Operation of Service; Termination of Access. We grant you a limited, non-transferable license to make personal use of the Service on one computer or mobile device in accordance with these Terms, and all applicable laws. This license does not include the right to resell or make any commercial use of the Service or any content available through the Service. David's Bridal retains the right, without notice and at any time, to modify, suspend or discontinue the availability of all or any part of the Service, to charge a fee for parts of the Service that may have been previously provided at no charge, to discontinue any products or services offered through the Service. David's Bridal is not liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. David's Bridal may disable your ability to access your account or may terminate your right to access or use the Service or any portion thereof, without notice, at any time, and for any reason, including reasons such as conduct that we, in our sole discretion, believe is in violation of any applicable law or is harmful to the interests of another user, David's Bridal or its suppliers, vendors, and content providers (collectively, "Providers"). Your right to use the Service terminates automatically if you fail to comply with these Terms. No notice is required from us to effect such termination. Additionally, we may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason and may give you notice of such termination by any means, such as e-mail, alert messages posted through the Service, posting notice on www.davidsbridal.com or otherwise generally publishing such termination. Upon termination, you must stop using the Service and remove all copies from your computer or mobile device. Rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive and remain in effect after any termination or expiration of the Terms. 5. Children. You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service, and, if you are under 18, you may use the Service only with the permission and involvement of a parent or guardian. 6. Content. The Web sites, mobile applications, and services comprising the Service, each of their respective components, all content provided by or through the Service, together with the user interface, the compilation and arrangement of the Web sites and mobile applications, and the text, photographs, audio and video, graphics, logos, illustrations, descriptions, data, and other material available on or through the Web sites and mobile applications provided as a part of the Service are referred to collectively as the "Content".

You may not post on or transmit through the Service any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable Content of any kind, including, but not limited to, any Content that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable law. If we are notified that you have submitted or posted such Content, then we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Content from the Service. We may disclose any Content or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the Service or our business; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of David's Bridal, its Providers, you or other users of the Service.

You will be liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights or proprietary rights, or from any other harm arising from an unauthorized submission or submission of any material prohibited by these Terms. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, any Content you transmit to the Service by e-mail or otherwise, including any photos, videos, stories, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like, is and will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and may be used by David's Bridal and its Providers, for any purpose, including, but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast, and posting. Furthermore, David's Bridal and its Providers are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you submit through the Service for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products or services using information contained in such communication. 8. Linked Third Party Sites.
Links to Web sites operated by third parties available through the Service, including links to Web sites operated by Providers, do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by David's Bridal of the content, policies, or practices of such Web sites.
