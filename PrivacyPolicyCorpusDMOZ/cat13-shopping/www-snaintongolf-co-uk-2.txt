Terms & Conditions
Terms & Conditions
Snainton Golf Centre Ltd is a company based in North Yorkshire, England. We thus operate within and are governed by UK law. As the user, you fully acknowledge that any transactions you make within our site are subject to our terms and conditions as outlined below.
1. General
1.1 Snainton Golf reserves the right to amend any conditions stated within this document at any time in order to improve our the experience of our customers. By shopping with us you understand and comply with all/any relevant sections that apply to you.
1.2 We as a company strive to deliver the best possible customer service, value for money and selection of goods we can.
1.3 If you are purchasing an item from our store on behalf of another person/persons, you declare that you have said person/persons full permission to do so.
2. Ordering & Payment
2.1 Orders can be placed with us either online or direct via our sales hotline - 01723850014.
2.2 Upon confirming your order, you will be taken to our secure checkout to complete your purchase. All our online orders are processed securely using 128bit SSL encryption, vital for ensuring safe transactions. If you do not wish to order online then please refer to our sales hotline 01723850014 to complete your purchase via telephone. Once your order has been submitted, you will receive an order confirmation email. It is then processed by our picking and despatch team. Once your item(s) is(are) posted, you will receive a despatched email to let you know your order is in transit. If your item is posted via a DPD service, you should receive a confirmation email and SMS notification if applicable from themselves also, updating you on any progress and delivery schedules for your parcel(s).
2.3 Due to ever-increasing attempts at fraud with online orders, especially from outside the UK, Snainton Golf Centre Ltd reserves the right to decline any order that we deem not to be genuine. If this is the case an alternative method of payment can be discussed. We also do not send out credit card receipts with your invoice, as this holds your payment method information. If you would like this copy, we can arrange for it to be posted to you, but this is at your own risk.
2.4 We offer a selection of secure payment methods to purchase items both online or via telephone. We accept Credit/Debit cards, AMEX, Paypal, Paypal credit, Amazon Pay, Lending Works 0% finance, Cheques or Gift Vouchers. Full details for these methods are available to view in our 'Ordering & Payment' section of Support.
2.5 We offer a 0% finance option for any eligible orders over the value of £300 operated by Lending Works. Finance is subject to status. More details are available in our '0% Finance' section. Finance is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Consumer Credit Act.
2.6 Consumers have a legal right to withdraw from the finance within 14 days of the agreement commencing. This withdrawal notice should be made directly to the lender in writing. If the item is returned as per our money-back guarantee within this period, any such items need to be returned in the same manner they were originally received. Any refunds given will, therefore, be subject to our inspection upon return. If you should wish to cancel the credit agreement after 14 days, please be aware that this right to withdraw is a right to withdraw from the finance agreement only, and therefore customers must find an alternative method of funding any outstanding balance.
3. Delivery
3.1 Snainton Golf will always strive to achieve the quickest delivery times possible when despatching parcels. For most UK and International orders, we use DPD. For smaller packages (ie certain clothing, gloves, small accessories and caps) we use Royal Mail. Delivery timescales and our shipping prices are detailed in our 'Delivery' section, along with our list of eligible countries. If your country, region or location is not listed in this section, please email john@snaintongolf.co.uk for more information, as certain locations may be eligible despite not being listed.
3.2 The threshold for free delivery on our online store is £20.00.
3.3 For all next working day delivery orders, the threshold time is 3pm. All orders placed after 3pm with next working day delivery will be processed the following day.
3.4 Please note that although our delivery schedules listed in the 'Delivery' section are accurate, they are not necessarily guaranteed. We cannot be held responsible for any extenuating circumstances that may cause minor delays with our courier services. In the event a parcel is delayed to our knowledge, we will always be in touch via email or telephone to inform you of any such events.
3.5 It is the consumer's responsibility to provide us with an address where delivery can be signed for in reasonable time. If delivery is refused or returned after THREE attempts it incurs a £6 resend charge AND £6 if returned back to us. To avoid this situation, please ensure that you always provide an appropriate address where you or a designated person are most likely to be present, provide us with a safe place(s) where your parcel can be safely left in the event that you are out*, and provide us with a valid contact email address and mobile phone number. This is essential for our courier services as well as ourselves if we need to contact you. Please be aware if these conditions are ignored, you are liable to our charges outlined above. We feel that 3 attempts at delivery is a more than sufficient time period to be able to receive your order successfully. *Please note that any safe places given are done so at your own risk. Nor Snainton Golf or our courier services accept any responsibility for any potential outcomes associated with this.
4.Returns
4.1 Should you wish to return an item for any reason please see our 'Returns' section for full detailed information. If you have any questions regarding this, our team can be contacted between 8.30am-9pm weekdays and 8.30am-5pm weekends via our sales hotline - 01723850014.
4.2 All items have a 14-day contact money-back guarantee. However, if you are dissatisfied with your item, returns will be dealt with upon receipt unused in the manner it was delivered to you. This excludes custom-fitted clubs and all personalised items as they are bespoke to the purchaser's requirements.
4.3 The statutory rights of the consumer are not affected by the terms of our service.
4.4 If for any reason you need to cancel your order, please contact us on 01723 850014 as soon as possible. However, as we endeavour to ship your order very quickly, it may not always be possible to cancel an order. If an item is cancelled whilst in transit, a £10 re-direction charge will be made for the return of the goods back to us without a receipt.
4.5 Our returns policy is split into three sections. They are as follows:
4.6 Faulty Goods - If you receive an item that is damaged, please inform us within a reasonable timescale. We will offer either a replacement item to be sent or a full refund for the item(s) only. If you request a refund, we would ask that the faulty item(s) is/are returned within 30 days. If you require an exchange we will replace goods deemed faulty to ensure this deadline is met.
*Please note - We reserve the right to acquire a manufacturers inspection before we refund or exchange any items to verify an official decision of some complaints. On products within their warranty period, we will always replace or repair the item. If the item is faulty after 30 days and up to 6 months we will repair or replace the product and refund any carriage charges you may incur. After this six month period expires all returns of faulty goods within warranty periods are to be returned at the customer's cost.
4.7 Incorrect Sizing - If you have ordered the wrong sized item or your goods do not fit, we will gladly exchange them within 14 days of receipt. You must notify us of this as soon as possible upon receiving your goods, and return any item(s) to us with the returns form completed and a covering letter if necessary. Alternatively, we offer a collection and delivery service also known as a 'swap job'. This hassle-free option is available direct to your home or workplace £15. Please call us if you would like to discuss this on our sales hotline 01723 850014.
4.8 Unwanted Goods - You have the right to cancel your order within 7 working days commencing the day after you receive your goods. The unwanted item(s) must be returned in their original condition with the appropriate packaging to receive a full refund. We will refund the cost of the item(s), excluding courier costs within 30 days from the e-mail notification of your intention to cancel. This must be within 7 days of receipt of goods. See below for information relevant to custom fit, Myjoy shoes and personalised items.
4.9 Customised/Personalised items - In the unlikely event you order custom fitted clubs and they are unwanted for any reason - you are entitled to cancel the order within a 24 hour period of placing the order. Please note however that because of the bespoke nature of these items a 20% surcharge will apply.
We will not refund unwanted MyJoy shoes orders or custom-fitted clubs under any circumstances after you take delivery and is your responsibility to order correctly at the time of ordering your club selection so please check your order! We think 72 hours is reasonable for you to tell us if we have sent incorrect clubs from your order.
5. Loyalty Scheme
5.1 Our loyalty scheme is available for customers who have placed an order(s) with us. If you register an account with us when you make a purchase through our online store, you will automatically be enrolled in our loyalty scheme. This initiative is the perfect incentive for our return customers to save money on future purchases.
5.2 Loyalty points are awarded at a rate of 1% of your total spend. I.e a £100 order would receive a discount to the value of £1 for future orders.
5.3 Loyalty points promotions are available at certain times of the year. Usually featured around holiday times, bank holidays, major golf tournaments or other special events, these promotions often see multiplied points rewards for purchases of between 5%-10%.
5.4 Please note that any orders placed outside of these promotional periods are not eligible to receive bonus loyalty points.
5.5 Loyalty points cannot be used against any previous orders.
5.6 Loyalty points are not applicable to orders placed via telephone.
6. Delays, Stocking Issues & Back Orders
6.1 If for any reason your order cannot be shipped within a reasonable timescale, we will always be in contact with you via email or telephone to inform you of this.
6.2 In the rare event that an item purchased is out of stock, we will endeavour to either reorder such a product, offer you a suitable or selection of suitable alternatives, or of course offer a full and complete refund. Please be understanding that we like all businesses across all sectors of retail can occasionally fall foe to a stocking error, malfunction or mishap. We do however pride ourselves on offering the best customer care possible so if this is the case, we will do everything we reasonably can to ensure as little inconvenience is incurred, often offering replacement items or similar products at a discounted price or offering discounts on future orders.
6.3 If an order placed contains multiple items in a case where one or some of such item(s) has to be reordered, our policy is to hold the existing items in reserve so as to ship the order once complete. We can, however, subject to the delivery location and based on product size/value, ship any items holding prior to this, before forwarding on any remaining items once in stock. For more details on this please email john@snaintongolf.co.uk
6.4 Custom fit clubs are bespoke items and thus have to be carefully made to measure by the manufacturers. Due to the nature of such procedures, delivery times are extended. The usual timeframe for a custom fit order is between 7-10 working days although in certain cases this can differ if any relevant components are backlogged for any reason. If this is the case, we will inform you of this by telephone or email.
6.5 Personalised items and Myjoys shoes, like custom-fit clubs, are bespoke items made to the customers' specific requirements. With the manufacturing process being lengthened for such orders, delivery can take anything from 3-4 working weeks to arrive.
