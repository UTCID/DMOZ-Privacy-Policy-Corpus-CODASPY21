Plastic Oceans UK
Greenfingers is committed to supporting children and families through the creation of magical gardens at children's hospices throughout the UK.
All the Greenfingers’ gardens are unique and are created to help make life a little better for children and families in hospices.
Plastic Oceans UK have been experts on plastic pollution for nearly a decade. This began with our award-winning documentary A Plastic Ocean, now available for streaming on Netflix. Now, we’re solving the plastic crisis through our science, sustainability and education programmes.
Through changing attitudes, behaviours and practices on the use and value of plastics, we can stop plastic pollution reaching the ocean within a generation.
