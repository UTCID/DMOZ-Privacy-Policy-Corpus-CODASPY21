Terms Of Sale
Converse Terms
Of Sale
Please read these TERMS of Sale carefully
before ordering Products online from THe CONVERSE PLATFORM. Please note that
these terms of sale APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE CONVERSE PLATFORM IN THE UNITED
STATES ONLY AND include the ADDITIONAL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.
APPLICABILITY
You are reading these Terms of Sale (“Terms of Sale”) because you
are using a Converse website, digital experience, social media platform, mobile
app, or one of our other products or services, all of which are part of Converse’s
Platform (“Platform”). These Terms of Sale create a legally binding agreement between you
and Converse and its affiliates (which we may refer to as “Converse,” “we,”
“us,” or “our”) regarding orders placed for products available on the Platform. Converse may
revise these Terms of Sale without notice by posting revised Terms of Sale on
its Platform. The Terms of Sale posted on the Platform at the time you place your
order on the Platform will govern that purchase. Please read these terms
carefully and check that the details of your order are complete and accurate
before submitting your order. If you think that there is a mistake, please
contact us. Converse’s
Terms of Use and Privacy
Policy are incorporated
herein by this reference.
PLACING ORDERS ON THE PLATFORM
ELIGIBILITY TO ORDER
To place an order on the Platform, you must be of legal age in
your jurisdiction of residence and a consumer - not a reseller.
NO PURCHASE FOR RESALE
The Platform is intended solely for Converse to sell Converse products
directly to end consumers, and therefore purchase of products for resale is strictly
prohibited. Purchase for resale means the purchase of a Converse product by
someone who resells, or intends to resell, the Converse product to others
(consumers, businesses or any third party). If Converse believes you are
involved in purchase for resale, Converse reserves the right to take any action
against you, including, without limitation, to restrict sales to you, cancel
your orders, and/or suspend or close your account.
HOW TO ORDER
You need an email address to place an order, and you may need to
set your browser to accept both (functional) cookies and pop-ups in order to be
able to use all the functionalities of the Platform, which includes designing
customized items, adding items to your shopping cart, and submitting your
order.
When you submit an order, we will send you an email acknowledging
receipt of your order. Our acceptance of the order takes place when the products
are shipped to you - we will send you an email confirming that the products
have been shipped (“Order Confirmation”). At this point a contract, containing
these Terms of Sale, comes into existence and is binding on you and us (the
“Contract”). We recommend that you print or download a copy of these Terms of
Sale and the relevant Order Confirmation for future reference. If we are unable
to supply you with a product, we will inform you of this in writing and will
not process the order.
Once your order is placed, you can check on its status at any time
using the Order Status link on Converse.com. Use your order number (which can
be found in your confirmation email), email address and billing zip code to
sign into Converse.com for up-to-date info on where your order is in the
process. When your order ships, we’ll send you a shipping confirmation email
with tracking information – so you can follow your shipment every step of the
way. If you have a Converse Account and were logged in when you placed your
order, the order information will appear within your order history in Your
Account.
OUR RIGHT TO REJECT YOUR ORDER OR CANCEL
A CONTRACT
Fulfillment of all orders on the Platform is subject to
availability. We explicitly reserve the right not to accept your order for any
reason. We also reserve the right to cancel a Contract by written notice to you
in the following situations, without being liable for any damage or costs other
than repayment of any amount received from you in relation to the Contract we
cancelled:
•  the product is not available
or in stock;
•  your billing information is
not correct or not verifiable;
•  your order is flagged by our
security systems as an unusual order or an order susceptible to fraud;
•  we believe you are under the
legal age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence;
•  we believe that you are a
reseller;
•  there was an error in the
price displayed on the Platform;
•  we could not deliver to the
address provided by you;
•  due to an Event Outside Our
Control (see below); or
•  in the event of misspelling,
pricing or other errors or mistakes in the Platform information.
DATA CHECK
When you submit your order, we may run some checks on it before it
is fulfilled. These checks may include verifying your address and checking for
fraud. We run partly automated checks on all purchases to filter out unusual or
suspect transactions, or transactions which can be identified as susceptible to
fraud. Suspected fraud on the Platform will be investigated and if necessary
prosecuted.
TITLE TRANSFER
The risk of loss and title for products purchased from Converse
pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
PRICE/PAYMENT
PAYMENT METHODS
You can find the available payment methods in the Payment Options section of the
Platform. We do not accept any method of payment other than those listed in this
section.
PAYMENT PROCESSING
Except with respect to pre-ordered or custom products, if you pay
by credit/debit card, we will deduct the amount due from your account as soon
as your order leaves our warehouse. Payments can only be processed if the
billing information can be verified.
PRICES AND CURRENCY
The product prices displayed on the Platform are in United States
dollars and the order total will include sales tax, as applicable. Shipping
rates are applied per order. Because sales tax rates and rules vary by state
and local jurisdiction, we apply sales taxes based on the shipping destination
of your order. You’ll see the estimated taxes in your cart during checkout, and
exact taxes will be calculated and charged at the time of shipping.
YOUR TOTAL PRICE
The total price specified in the final check-out screen includes
tax and shipping costs. This price will be recorded in the Order Confirmation,
which we recommend you print or download for future reference. If paying by
credit card, the total amount for your entire order will be reflected on your
statement.
PRICE CHANGES
The prices of the products will be as displayed on the Platform.
Prices may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order
which we have confirmed in an Order Confirmation.
PROMOTIONS
Promotional codes are limited in nature, void where prohibited,
and may expire or discontinue with or without notice. Promotional codes may not
be copied, sold, or applied to prior or future purchases. They are not
redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for
any reason. Items eligible for promotional discounts may be limited to stock on
hand.
SHIPPING & DELIVERY
DELIVERY – WHERE AND WHEN
Please refer to the Shipping & Delivery section of
the Platform for dates and the available delivery times and methods.
SPLIT DELIVERY
When possible, we try to deliver all items which you have ordered
at the same time. However, please note that an order for customized products
may result in split shipments.
We reserve the right to split the delivery of
your order, for instance if part of your order is delayed. In the event that we
split your order, we will notify you of our intention to do so by sending you
an e-mail to the e-mail address provided by you at the time your order was
placed. You will not be charged for any additional delivery costs.
INSPECTION UPON DELIVERY
Upon delivery, please inspect the packaging for damage. If it
appears that the products are damaged, please do not accept the shipment and
contact Customer Service immediately.
SHIPPING RATES
Free standard shipping is available for all orders over $50.00, or
for all orders placed by Converse.com members. See the Shipping & Delivery section of
the Platform for additional delivery rates for standard and expedited shipping.
RETURNS &
CANCELLATIONS
CANCELLING ORDER BEFORE DELIVERY
We do try to process all orders as quickly as possible, but we
might be able to help if the order has not been shipped. Please check the
status of your order first by visiting the "Order status" link at the
top right of the Platform. If the status of your order is "Pending"
or "On Hold" you may cancel your order by contacting our customer
service. Our customer service agents will request a cancellation of your order
at our warehouse. If successful, they will send you an email and the
cancellation will be free of charge. If we’re unable to cancel your order, it
will ship as scheduled. But don’t worry – you can return it for any reason within
30 days, free of charge.
See details below.
RETURNING ORDERS AFTER DELIVERY
Whether you buy online or in-store, you may return your
Converse.com purchase for any reason for a refund or exchange within 30 days of
the date of delivery.
After 30 days, Converse product must be unused, unworn,
unwashed, and untreated to receive a refund or exchange.
For in-store
purchases, bring back your Converse products with your receipt for a full
refund to the original form of payment.
Converse product purchased from
another authorized retailer or vendor cannot be returned to Converse.com or a
Converse retail store.
For online purchases, Converse.com offers free returns within the
continental U.S.
Just use the return label included in your shipment.
If your
order did not include a return label or if you’ve misplaced or discarded the
label, you can get a new one in a couple of ways:
Simply enter your order number in
the Order Status window.
Contact our Customer Service Team.
Or, you can always return your
items to your nearest Converse store.
We stand behind our products.
If your Converse products contain a
defect not caused by normal wear and tear, we want to know about it and more
importantly, get you back in the game.
If it's been longer than 30 days since
your purchase was delivered, contact the Customer Service Team to discuss your
options.
You may also have other rights that vary from state to state.
REFUND INFORMATION
After we receive and process your return, we’ll send you a
confirmation email and process your refund to your original form of payment
within two business days. Please note that it may take up to 10 additional
business days for your payment method to reflect the refund. Gift cards purchased on
Converse.com are not refundable. See additional Refund information here.
EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
An Event Outside Our Control means any act or event beyond our
reasonable control, including, without limitation, strike, lock-out or other
industrial action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist
attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat
or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence,
epidemic or other natural disaster, or failure of public or private
telecommunications networks.
If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the
performance of our obligations under these Terms of Sale:
a)
We will
contact you as soon as reasonably possible to notify you; and
b)
Our
obligations under these general conditions will be suspended and the time for
performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event
Outside Our Control.
If the Event Outside Our Control affects our delivery of a product
to you, we will arrange a new delivery date with you after the Event Outside
Our Control is over. In many circumstances, you may cancel the Contract if an
Event Outside Our Control takes place and you no longer wish us to provide the
products. Please see your cancellation rights under the Cancellations section
above.
OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to
another organization, but this transfer will not affect your rights or our
obligations under these Terms of Sale.
You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms
of Sale to another person if we agree in writing.
Each of the paragraphs of this Terms of Sale operates separately.
If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or
unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations
under these Terms of Sale, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or
if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights
against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
obligations.
If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing,
and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by
you. We will not file a copy of the Contract between us.
