Making A Purchase
Making a purchase could not be easier. Just browse our store, and add any items that you wish to buy into the shopping cart. After you have finished your selection, click on ‘Checkout’ and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to complete the order.
We accept Visa and Mastercard. Backordered items are not charged until they are shipped. You may send your credit card information via phone, snail mail or over the Internet.
When confirmation of order is received, this is to indicate that we have received your order. It does not indicate that a contract exists between us. We will indicate acceptance of your order, and hence a contract between us, when we send you an invoice. We have included this term to protect us in the case that a mistake has been made in pricing, we have inadvertently under-priced goods, or we are no longer able to supply a particular product for some reason. In the case of a change of price, we will always contact you first to ensure that the price is acceptable.
Shipping And Handling
A shipping charge of either £2.95 or £3.95 or £4.95 (depending on size of parcel) will be added to all orders under £100 to cover postage and packaging. This covers postage to the UK only.
All goods are sent by Royal Mail as a minimum standard and we receive a proof of postage for every item sent this way. If you are unable to take delivery to your house, you may ask for your items to be left in an alternative place – such as “in the garden shed” or “behind the wheelie bins”. We are happy to follow these instructions, but can take no responsibility or further action if items subsequently go missing. In the unusual circumstance that this happens we will arrange for you to receive a copy of proof of postage and you will have to claim from the Royal Mail. If you do not want to do this, please do not leave instructions for deliveries to be left anywhere other than with a neighbour or yourself.
Delivery Schedule
We deliver your order as fast as we can! Most orders are despatched within 2 working days, but many are often sent the same or next day . If you are overseas and want items posted internationally, this is usually not a problem at all, however you must contact us before placing the order..
Back Orders
If your item is not in stock, we will back order for you. You will always be emailed with the option to cancel your order if you would rather not wait.
Credit Card Security
You will be automatically transferred to the World Pay secure server to process your credit/debit
card details with complete confidence. World Pay are an accredited payment service provider. They handle your credit card transaction in a highly secure environment using 128 bit SSL Verisign
encryption.
Guarantee
All of our products come with a 30 day no-quibble guarantee. See the returns policy below.
