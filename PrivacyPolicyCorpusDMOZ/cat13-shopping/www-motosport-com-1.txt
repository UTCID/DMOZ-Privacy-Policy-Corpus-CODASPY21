Certain of the products sold via our Services are manufactured by or for Backcountry (Backcountry Products) and may be subject to a limited warranty provided by Backcountry. If your Backcountry Product is subject to a limited warranty, the limited warranty for your Backcountry Product outlines your exclusive remedies and the procedures to make a warranty claim. If your Backcountry Product is sold without a limited warranty, then it is sold as is and with all faults.
