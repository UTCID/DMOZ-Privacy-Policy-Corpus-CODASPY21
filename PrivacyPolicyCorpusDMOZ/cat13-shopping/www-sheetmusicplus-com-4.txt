SMP Level Guidelines
Our new Sheet Music Plus levels are designed to help you select music in the correct difficulty level. Each piece that includes a Sheet Music Plus level has been carefully evaluated to ensure that it follows the level guidelines below. Since each individual piece is reviewed by hand, only a small subset of titles currently includes level information. However, we are constantly reviewing additional titles to expand our selection of graded music.
