Art Impressions is proud to be an Angel Company. We are pleased that you would choose our stamps for your enterprising projects!
We ask that all such projects using our images are hand-stamped. No mechanical reproduction or manipulation of any kind is permitted. All card sales must be sold in a local business manner, whether small business sales or online sites. To use Art Impressions stamps in this way, please contact us requesting permission with an explanation as to how they will be used. A letter of consent will be issued to you via email or postal service.
We have a “Hand Stamped with Love” stamp with our logo that is free with a $30 purchase with coupon code APSTAMP – you can find the stamp on our website here. It is not required to use this stamp, but since we had requests for a stamp like this, we are happy to make it available. This promotion cannot be combined with other offers.
