Shipping & Delivery
How are the shipping costs calculated?
Lamps Plus shipping charges are based on the size, weight and destination zone of the product ordered. For any order under $50, a $5 shipping charge will be added. Express delivery or second day delivery is extra. For more information, contact our Customer Service department at 877-704-2425. If you are a member of our Professionals program, call 800-304-8120. To learn more about our shipping policy, click here.
How does your free shipping work?
We offer "free shipping" or "free shipping and free returns" on many of our products. "Free shipping" refers to standard shipping; express delivery and second day charges are extra. Our "free shipping and free returns" offer is available to the lower 48, continental U.S. states only, not available on orders to Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, Mexico or other international destinations. Products that ship by freight are not eligible for free shipping or free returns. "Free returns" does not apply to items with giclee art shades, Color Plus and Tiffany Color Plus brand items, or certain products with designer shades. To read more about our shipping policy, click here.
How Does the Delivery Service for Howard Miller Furniture and Clocks Work?
Howard Miller brand furniture and clocks use a special delivery service for orders shipped in the US. This service includes delivery by two delivery people who will take the furniture piece or clock up a maximum of two flights of stairs, position the furniture or clock as desired and remove all packing materials. Read a full description here.
What is White Glove Delivery?
Our White Glove Delivery service is a special service for the home delivery of our oversized furniture, special order furniture, and other related products shipped in the continental US. Not all furniture items on our website ship via White Glove Delivery; items that do will be indicated in your shopping cart, or you can call us for more information. We offer two types of White Glove Delivery service: Silver White Glove Delivery and Gold White Glove Delivery. We're sorry, but this service is not available for Alaska, Hawaii, New York, Canada, or for other international orders.
Learn more about these services on our Shipping and Delivery page.
What is Blanket Wrap Delivery?
White Glove Blanket Wrap Delivery is a special service required for the home delivery of certain made-to-order, fully assembled furniture that is unboxed and shipped in the continental US. Items shipped via White Glove Blanket Wrap Delivery are carefully wrapped in packing blankets and hand-delivered by white glove professionals. Service also includes placement of the item/s inside your home or office, and the unwrapping and removal of any packing material. There may be additional charges if the delivery has to go up or down more than one level in the home, requires the use of an elevator, or if the driver is unable to access your neighborhood with a standard delivery vehicle. Delivery time is 2 to 4 weeks from the shipment date, but may be more in the holiday season. We're sorry, but this service is not available for Alaska, Hawaii, New York, Canada, or for other international orders.
Learn more about these services on our Shipping and Delivery page.
What is Threshold Delivery?
Some furniture and oversized items will ship by Threshold Delivery, in which delivered items shipped in the contiguous US will be brought into the entry or foyer of your home. Some items, because of size or weight, may only be able to be delivered to the garage, porch, or the first dry area of your home. We're sorry, but this service is not available for Alaska, Hawaii, New York, Canada, or for other international orders.
Learn more about these services on our Shipping and Delivery page.
What is FedEx SmartPost?
FedEx SmartPost is a service from FedEx that uses the United States Postal Service® (USPS) for final delivery of low-weight packages. It is a cost-effective shipping method that allows us to offer free shipping on a wide range of product designs. We use FedEx SmartPost in certain instances to ship to the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii. For more information, please see the FedEx SmartPost website.
How does your Store Pick Up policy work?
We offer a "buy online, pick up in store" option for many of our products that allows you pick up your order at the store location of your choice. To do this, simply click on the "Store Pick Up" option that appears on either the Product Page or the cart checkout page and fill in the necessary information. When your order has arrived at the store, you will receive an email confirmation that it is ready for pickup. Please wait for the pickup confirmation email before going to the store location.
What kind of packing materials does Lamps Plus use?
We are committed to using eco-friendly packing solutions whenever possible. We use air-filled pillow bags that efficiently pack into boxed shipments and reduce the amount of packing material needed for each order. We also use 100 percent biodegradable starch pellets as packing materials. These static-free pellets have the look of the old-fashioned plastic packing peanuts, but are made to degrade quickly in landfills and are completely petroleum, CFC and HCFC free.

Returns & Replacements
What is your returns policy?
If for any reason you are unsatisfied with a purchase, it can be returned within 60 days of the date you receive it. Absolutely no returns or exchanges will be made after 60 days.
To ensure that your return is processed accurately and promptly, please first call us. Customers can reach us at 877-704-2425. If you are a member of our Professionals program, call 800-304-8120.
A Customer Service Specialist will provide you a Return Merchandise Authorization for you to write on the pre-printed address label at the bottom of the Returns form included with your boxed order.
Please note the following:
All returns must be made with a Return Merchandise Authorization number.
Furniture and rug purchases cannot be returned to a Lamps Plus store location; they must be shipped back to our warehouse.
All returned items must be sent back to us using the original shipping boxes and packing materials.
Installed products with cut wires or loose crystal will be subject to a $50 fee.
Sales of clearance items, giclée items personalized with uploaded photos, and custom made-to-order items are final.
Some product categories may include free return shipping; this offer applies only to the 48 continental US states and may exclude certain items with designer and giclée shades and items that ship by freight. White Glove and Threshold orders must be returned within 10 days.
To read more about our returns policy, click here.
Do you carry lamp parts?
We offer lamp shades and accessories for sale, but, generally speaking, we do not carry lamp parts. In some instances, however, there may be some replacement parts available for items we normally stock. Contact us and talk with a Lighting & Home Décor Consultants to learn more. If we do not have a part in stock we will gladly refer you to a vendor that carries it.
How does your "no restocking fee" policy work?
Lamps Plus will not charge a restocking fee on items that are in-stock and purchased from a Lamps Plus store, in-store kiosk or online at LampsPlus.com. This includes items depicted in a Lamps Plus print catalog and other printed advertising materials.
Lamps Plus will apply a restocking fee to items that are selected from vendor catalogs and special ordered. Special ordered items that are returned or cancelled are subject to a restocking fee of 20% of the item price.
White Glove Delivery items are also subject to a restocking fee of 10% of the item price.
Please note that all returned merchandise must be in the original packaging. Merchandise returned with cut wires or loose crystal will be subject to a $50 fee. For more information, view our complete returns policy.

Payment
Why is there sales tax when I purchase online?
Lamps Plus is required by certain states to charge sales tax on online orders. Sales tax will be automatically added to the shopping cart. Please note that we do not add sales tax unless we are required by law to do so.
Alabama customers please note: Seller has collected the simplified sellers use tax on transaction(s) delivered into Alabama and the tax will be remitted on the customer's behalf to the Alabama Department of Revenue. Seller's program account number is SSU- R010068698.
What kind of credit card payments do you accept?
Lamps Plus accepts American Express, Visa, Master Card, and Discover credit cards for online purchases on LampsPlus.com.
What other payment options are available?
PayPal is available as a payment option at checkout. Personal checks, purchase orders and money orders are also accepted, but you must first call in your order to 800-782-1967. For personal checks, purchase orders and money orders, please note that we cannot ship your purchases until these funds clear our bank, a process which may add additional time to your order. Purchase orders must be faxed to us at 818-341-1618 with the original signature attached, then the form must be mailed to us to complete final processing. Mail to: Lamps Plus, Internet Department, Purchase Orders, 20250 Plummer Street, Chatsworth, CA 91311.
Do you have a minimum order policy?
We require a minimum online order of $10 at LampsPlus.com. The vast majority of our items are more than $10 so this usually isn't a problem, but for smaller items, we need a minimum dollar amount in order to meet minimum shipping and handling charges.
When and how do you charge my card? What is an "authorization hold"?
If you are paying by credit card or debit card, an authorization will be placed on your card to hold funds for the amount of your order.
This authorization hold means you cannot use the amount of funds needed for your order total, but the funds have been reserved for us, but not yet been transferred to us. This hold ensures that the funds will be available on your account when your order is processed. Depending on how long it takes for your order to ship it may be necessary to process a new authorization hold.
Most authorization holds last from 3 to 7 days, but may vary depending on the bank or financial institution you are using. For specific information please contact your card-issuing bank or institution for its policy.
As your merchandise leaves our warehouse, we'll charge the form of payment that you used when placing your order and will send you a shipping confirmation email. Your card will only be charged when your order ships and you will only be charged once for what you have ordered.

What are the terms and conditions for the 120% Price Protection Policy?

What is your quality assurance guarantee?
The Lamps Plus, Inc. Quality Assurance Program is a vital part of our corporate policy and store operations and is fully supported by senior management. Our organization is committed to an effective product safety program that ensures that our stores and products meet established standards for safety, quality and value. Lamps Plus, Inc. offers quality products that meet or exceed product requirements established by applicable government agencies and our Quality Assurance department. Suppliers and products are evaluated for compliance with company standards and regulatory requirements through vendor audits and product inspections on an ongoing basis. The Quality Assurance department investigates customer concerns and initiates the appropriate follow-up and response action. If you have any questions, or to send us a comment, email us.
What is your warranty policy?
Lamps Plus, Inc. proudly stands behind the products we sell. The Lamps Plus One-Year Warranty states that we will repair or, at our option, replace at no charge, your purchase within one year of the purchase date should you discover any defect in materials or workmanship.
This warranty does not cover defects, including breakage or malfunctions, caused by your mishandling or use of the product in ways other than specified by the manufacturer. Light bulbs included with product are not covered by this warranty. Ceiling fans and furniture products are covered by the manufacturer's warranty included in their packaging. The furniture we sell is for residential use only, and is not designed, manufactured, or recommended for use in a commercial or non-residential setting.
This warranty extends the manufacturer's warranty by one year, excluding any electronic components, remote controls, or any in-home warranties. To obtain service for an item under warranty, please bring the product, your original receipt and this warranty to your closest Lamps Plus store, or contact our Customer Service department at 877-704-2425. If you are a member of our Professionals program, call 800-304-8120. All items must be brought into a Lamps Plus Store or returned to Lamps Plus for service.
In no event shall Lamps Plus, Inc. be liable for incidental damages. Some states do not allow limitations for how long an implied warranty lasts or the exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, which may vary from state to state. Please keep your original receipt with this warranty. If you have any questions, or to send us a comment related to our One-Year Warranty program, please use our contact us page.
Unless specifically noted, the lighting, furniture and other products we sell is for residential use only, and is not designed, manufactured, or recommended for use in a commercial or non-residential setting. For information about commercial grade designs, please contact our Lamps Plus Hospitality division.
What is Comparable Value?
Some product identifies a "Comparable Value" with a reference price. Please note that these references are for items that are exclusive to Lamps Plus, and which are manufactured and produced directly for Lamps Plus. By taking a link out of the retail chain, Lamps Plus can offer you a significant savings compared to similar brand name items. Lamps Plus believes that similar products are offered by other retailers at or about the "Comparable Value" price listed on the signs. However, we invite customers to shop our competitors and compare the value listed for the particular item and decide for themselves. Please note that the Comparable Value reference price is not an original price amount and does not refer to a price at which Lamps Plus has sold the item in question.
