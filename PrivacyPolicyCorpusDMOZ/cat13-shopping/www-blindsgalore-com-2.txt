Versatile Privacy
Shades with a top down/bottom up lift system provide the perfect combination of privacy and light control. These versatile shades can lift from the bottom, lower from the top, or do both, allowing you to adjust your ideal balance of natural light and visibility. This popular feature is used to allow natural light into the room while maintaining your privacy from the street. Don't let your view leave you vulnerable!
Top Down/Bottom Up Shades Are The Most Flexible
Have privacy and light when you want it, how you want it, with top down/bottom up shades. This lift system is simple, effective and the best versatile privacy option available. The best part? Many of our most popular shades can be configured with a top down/bottom up lift. These shades are available in both corded and cordless options.

Solar Shades Block Light But Preserve View
These light blocking shades act like sunglasses for your window. Solar shades are the best choice if you're looking to maintain your view and block the right amount of light at the same time. While they won't provide you with privacy at night, they will block the sun and let you enjoy your view during the day. Be sure to select the right level of openness – higher percentages will let in more light and leave you with a less obstructed view.
