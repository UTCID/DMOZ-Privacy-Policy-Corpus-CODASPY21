Volvette Policies Volunteer Vette COVID-19 Schedule Volunteer Vette's online store volvette.com will remain open and ship out daily as we have done since it was established. (We have noticed that normal UPS shipping times have been longer than normal)
Our Showroom is open, but we do offer curbside low contact order pick-up. If you want to have curbside pick-up you must be pre-paid by debit or credit card prior to pick-up. If you want to place a curbside order please call ahead @ 865-521-9100 and your order should be ready for pick-up within the hour. Once you arrive just give us a call to let us know that you are here to pick-up and we will bring your order to your car.
If you have questions we will be answering phones as always from 8:30-5:30 Monday-Friday.
Thanks for being a Volunteer Vette customer. We appreciate your business and please stay safe.
Free Shipping Policy In order to offer the absolute lowest prices to our customers, Volunteer Vette offers free shipping for Internet orders over $199.00. Free shipping applies to regular ground shipments within the contiguous 48 United States. *Some large items such as exhaust systems will ship with a discounted flat rate shipping cost (Parts that ship flat rate will be noted in their description). Parts the ship by truck freight are excluded from Free Shipping. If you wish to expedite you parts order, there are several UPS methods to choose from at an additional cost. Free shipping is not available to dealers, phone orders, truck freight, expedited shipping methods and/or parts specifically marked flat rate. If your order meets the qualifications for Free Shipping, you will be able to select Free Shipping in the shipping options section during check-out. (If you have any questions about Free Shipping on our website, please call 865-521-9100) If an item is returned that shipped with Free Shipping for any reason other than defective, the cost for us to ship the item to you will be deducted from your return credit. Shipping Policy We ship most of our products via UPS, using their standard rates. However, a few of our larger items exceed UPS's weight limits; therefore these items are shipped by a freight company. Please understand that the shipping amount calculated on our site is as accurate an estimate as we can provide. However, the actual shipping costs may differ slightly. If the difference is greater than 15%, we will call you for an approval before processing your order. Orders received after 2:30 pm Monday-Friday will ship the next business day. Orders placed after-hours and on Saturday and Sunday will ship the following business day. The following map shows approximate transit times for UPS Ground delivery.

Store Coupons Volunteer Vette promotional coupons are occasionally available by email only. To use a coupon...a current coupon code must be entered at the time of check-out. Each coupon has an expiration date and once expired can not be used. Multiple Discounts can not be added together to achieve higher amounts. If you have a problem with a discount code, please call 865-521-9100. Loyalty Discount Programs Volunteer Vette appreciates new as well as return customers and we have introduced three discount programs to help you save money. The discounts are as follows; The 5% discount for orders over $500. (This discount is a non-reoccuring one time discount.) Our 10% Discount is given for orders over $1000 and the max discount available is our 15% discount which is given on orders over $2000. The exception to any of the discounts are parts that are listed as (ND) Non-Discount. ND parts are not discountable, but the amount of the part can help you reach discount levels that will apply to your other parts. Also, the 10% and 15% discount are valid as long as you keep buying parts. Example: your order today is $1000 so you get the discount on this order. Tomorrow you order a $3 screw set. It will also get the discount as well as everything you buy as long as it is not labled (ND). Security Policy We have the best security available to protect your online orders. Our server is located in a secure data center with access control and 128-bit encryption of your personal and credit card information to protect you. Your credit card information is not stored on our web server longer than the time required to transmit and retrieve the order by our customer service team. Privacy Policy We respect your privacy. Have you ever provided your information on a web site and then received junk email or mail from third parties? We respect your privacy and will not send unsolicited mail, sell or provide your information to third parties or disseminate information about you other than as required by law. Availability Policy If your item is in stock, it will generally be shipped on the same day that you order. Orders placed after 1pm in most cases will be shipped on the next business day.
The amount of time for your order to reach its destination depends on the shipping method selected by you during the checkout process. Thank you for shopping at Volunteer Vette. If you would like to contact us regarding our policies or a particular order, please call 865-521-9100.
