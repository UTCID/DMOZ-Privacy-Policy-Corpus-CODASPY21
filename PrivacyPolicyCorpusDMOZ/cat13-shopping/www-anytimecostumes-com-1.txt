Privacy & Security
PRIVACY & SECURITY
At AnytimeCostumes.com we are committed to protecting your
privacy online. Below is a brief overview of the highlights
of our Privacy &
Security Policy. This will give you a summary of how
information is collected from you and how it is used.
Your Personal and
Payment Information is Safe
Whenever you provide any personal or payment information
(e.g., when making a purchase), we use SSL technology to
make sure that it is "encrypted" (all scrambled up) so that
no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over
the Internet, and all information is safely stored behind
our firewall.
Information Collected
When you shop on our site, we collect personal information
from you such as your name, e-mail address, billing
address, shipping address, telephone number and product
selections so that you can order products from us. All
Credit Card information is stored in our database in an
encrypted format, behind a secured, hacker-proof firewall.
For your security, the complete credit card number will
never be made available to view. Encrypted Credit Card
information is stored for the sole purpose of expediting
the checkout process for future purchases. We may also
collect IP address, domain types (e.g. .com or .org, etc.),
your browser type, the country, state and the pages of our
site and the length of time of your visit during your
visit.
How Information is Used
We do not sell or rent your personal information to others.
We use customer information we collect only for the
purposes of filling orders, contacting purchasers to inform
them of their order status, sending promotional
information, enhancing the operation of our site,
statistical purposes and to administer our systems.
Please note, we do send out periodic notifications regarding promotional offers via email.
Cookies
We use cookies only to help identify you when you visit our
store and to customize your experience. The cookies make
your use of the site easier, allow you to retrieve an
earlier shopping cart, make the site run more smoothly and
help us to maintain a secure site. You will be unable to
shop on our site without your browser set to accept
cookies.
Opt Out of Email Savings Promotions
You have the opportunity to subscribe to our email when you make your first purchase.
If you do subscribe at checkout, you can easily unsubscribe from all marketing promotion emails using the link contained at the bottom of all of our email newsletters with just one click.
