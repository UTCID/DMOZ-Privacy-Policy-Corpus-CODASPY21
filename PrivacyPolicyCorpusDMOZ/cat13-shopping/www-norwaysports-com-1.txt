Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy at NorwaySports.com
NorwaySports.com has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for NorwaySports.com website.
Personal Information
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at
NorwaySports.com. Here are the types of information we gather:
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give
us in any other way. As an added level of security, we do not store your credit card information. You can choose
not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We
use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping
for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information
when your Web browser accesses NorwaySports.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit
Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at
NorwaySports.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.
E-mail Communications: We use email communication to address customer support issues, to
communicate order confirmations, as well as shipping and tracking information. From time to time we may also send
you informational emails with regards to special product offerings and discounts. Promotional emails are only sent
out if you explicitly request to be on our email list. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may
receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from NorwaySports.com. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other
mail from us, please adjust your preferences or e-mail us your changes.
Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser and to and store items in your Shopping Bag between visits. The Help
portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies
allow you to take full advantage of some of the NorwaySports.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave
them turned on.
Does NorwaySports.com Share the Information it Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it
to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries NorwaySports.com controls
that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this
Privacy Notice.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In
some cases, these affiliated business may market or sell our products directly on their sites. In other cases, we
operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third
party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that
third party.
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information
from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including
paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to
personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of NorwaySports.com customers
on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not
want to receive such offers, please adjust your preferences or e-mail us your changes.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores,
subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that NorwaySports.com, or substantially all of its assets are
acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.
Interest-based Marketing: Third party vendors, including Google, show NorwaySports.com's ads on
sites on the internet and they use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website. You may opt out
of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out
page.
Protection of NorwaySports.com and Others: We release account and other personal information
when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NorwaySports.com, our users, or others. This includes
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally
identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this
Privacy Notice.
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about
you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
How Secure is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
software, which encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the first and last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing in encrypted
form.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to
sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Which Information Can I Access?
NorwaySports.com gives you access to information about your account and your interactions with NorwaySports.com
for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
What Choices Do I Have?
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a
purchase or to take advantage of such NorwaySports.com features.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your preferences. (If you do not want to
receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still
govern your use of NorwaySports.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site,
Site Seeing on the Internet.
Children
NorwaySports.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by
adults. If you are under 18, you may use NorwaySports.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail
periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web
site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all
information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never
materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the
past without the consent of affected customers.
Information You Give Us
You provide most such information when you search, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or
communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an
order through NorwaySports.com or one of our affiliates, provide information in Your Account, communicate with us by
phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; compile Wish Lists or other gift
registries; provide and rate Reviews. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as
your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped,
including addresses and phone number; e-mail addresses of NorwaySports.com Friends and other people; content of
reviews and e-mails to us; personal description.
Automatic Information
Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your
computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type
and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information
from other customers to create features such as Purchase Circles; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or
searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. During some visits we may use software tools
such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors,
length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and
methods used to browse away from the page.
Information from Other Sources
Examples of information we receive from other sources include; account information, purchase or redemption
information, and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which
we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search results and links, including paid listings
(such as Sponsored Links from Google); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help
prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.
Additional Practices and General Information
Our Support pages will give you all the information you need with regards to placing an order on our site,
pricing, taxes, shipping information, return policies and other relevant information.
