An important message from Express Chemist
In these unprecedented times due to COVID-19 we are listening to the latest advice from the government and their health specialists. We are continuing to work in these challenging times so that we can serve the needs of our customers.
Please note that we are receiving a particularly high volume of orders, enquiries, telephone calls and emails. We are working exceptionally hard to process orders and respond to customer enquiries as quickly as possible. Unfortunately it is currently taking a little longer to process and dispatch orders than usual, so please allow 2-3 working days for shipment.
Please also note that postal services and couriers are experiencing similar challenges so please allow longer delivery times than usual. We would be grateful if you can be patient and not contact us regarding your order before these times are up so we can reduce the pressure on our customer service team.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus stay at home and self-isolate for 10 days.
For information about coronavirus please click here.
Keep well and stay safe.

Main Express Chemist Help
Express Chemist Help At Express Chemist, we do not have a call centre because we believe that even with the best intentions, call centres have a tendency to be impersonal, and this is not right for a pharmacy. Instead, if you telephone us, you will get through to a core member of the team who will be able to help you. However, before you contact us, we advise you to check the following options to see if your query can be answered more efficiently. Please tell us the nature of your query:
Placing an order I have a query about an order I have recently placed I have a query about a product I am looking to supply products or services to Express Chemist Which countries do Express Chemist ship to? Tracking an order
Other queries
If you have a general query that is not covered by the above options, you can contact us using the form below:

Thank you for your enquiry! Your details have been sent to Express Chemist and we will respond as quickly as possible.
We're very fast and efficient at answering emails, and prefer communicating by email because we feel that we can give a very thorough reply. We answer emails properly and never give "stock" replies! You can email us using the form above, or of course by replying to your order receipt or update. However, if you have a query of an urgent nature, you can telephone us on 0800 542 1203 from within the UK, or +44 (0) 1622 763 434 from abroad. Phones are manned between 9am and 5.00pm, Monday to Friday. All our phones are manned here in our UK office - no call centres! We won't leave you in a queue. If we cannot take your call just leave a contact number and your order number (if you have one) with our messaging service and we will get back to you as soon as possible. All calls and emails are dealt with by helpful people, not somebody reading from a script! If you wish to write to us, you can send correspondence to:
