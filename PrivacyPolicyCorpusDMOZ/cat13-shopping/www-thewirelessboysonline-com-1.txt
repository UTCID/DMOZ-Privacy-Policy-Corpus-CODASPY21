to Protecting your Privacy
We take your privacy very seriously. Your information is protected using Secured Socket Layer or what is better known as SSL.
All information that you transmit to us using our secure server is fully
encrypted while being transmitted. Once your information is coded using the latest technology, 128 bit secure socket layer technology (SSL), and sent to us, your personal information is protected against unauthorized access and complies with all credit card and government regulations.
When placing an order for replacement parts, accessories and
equipment,  Your information is treated with respect and will not release your information to any other company or firm. We believe you are our customer and will not sell your name or information to other companies.
Purchasing a Cell Phone Contract
When purchasing a cell phone contract with one of the wireless carriers you will
be required to provide information so that the wireless provider you choose,
whether it be AT&T, Nextel, Sprint, T-Mobile or Verizon wireless can run a
standard industry credit check. This credit check is required to approve you for the service plan you select since credit
is essentially being extended to you by the carrier.  The information
provided by you  is shared and used by an agency for performing a credit history check and is
handled with the utmost respect and confidentiality and conforms with
government and industry guidelines. Email Marketing and
Promotions
We may from time to time may send out a newsletter of
changes in the industry or promotional material. The broadcast material and
promotions that are sent out always do have an opt-out option located at the
bottom of the letter which will automatically remove you from any and all future
mailings from us. If you do choose to opt out this will only prevent future
promotional materials from being sent and all order related information such as
future order confirmations and order tracking information will still be sent in
order to keep up with our high customer service standards and letting you know
where your order is at all times. © 2001-2020 copyright. All rights reserved
