You are not permitted to use the Marks without the prior written consent of Company, its licensors or such third party that may own the Marks.
Registration on the Site
You may be required or permitted to register for the Site in order to access certain Services or Materials, to purchase Products, to receive promotional communications or other advertising information, or to access certain content offered on the Site. If you are required to establish an account in connection with a particular Service or Material, you must complete the designated registration process for such Service or Material. All required registration information that you provide must be current, complete and accurate and kept up to date on a prompt, timely basis. It is your sole responsibility to keep your username, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Company immediately.
This Site is intended solely for users who are 13 years of age or older and it is a violation of these Terms of Use for anyone under the age of 13 to register for the Site. You represent and warrant that you are 13 years old or older. Your account may be deleted without warning if you misrepresent your age, whether older or younger. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you must obtain your parent/guardian’s permission to register for the Site and post content thereto.
In order to be eligible to register, you must meet the following requirements:
You must be a human to register. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.
You must provide all of the information requested by Company in order to complete the registration process. Handling of such information will be conducted in accordance with the Company Privacy Policy, which can be found at http://accucut.com/pages/privacy-policy. You will also be required to create a username and password.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accessed the Site through your account).
One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one account.
Product Orders and Purchases
If you wish to purchase any Product via the Site (each such purchase, a "Transaction"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Transaction including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant to Company the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf, and to otherwise handle such information in accordance with the Company Privacy Policy. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.
Certain weights, measures, and other descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from this Site. By placing an order, you represent that the Products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

In addition, you remain responsible for any taxes that may be applicable to your Transactions.
Company’s acknowledgement of an order means that your order request has been received; it does not mean that your order has been accepted or shipped or that the price or availability of a Product has been confirmed. Company makes a conscientious effort to describe and display its Products accurately on the Site. Despite these efforts, a small number of items on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information on the Site and in our advertising on other sites. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, Product images, specifications, availability, and services. Company reserves the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the risk of loss for and title to Products purchased on the Site passes to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase you may return it in accordance with Company’s Return Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms & Conditions in its entirety.
