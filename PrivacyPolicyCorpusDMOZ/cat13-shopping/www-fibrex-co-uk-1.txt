Begonia corms are dispatched from mid February until late March. These are started into growth (not dormant). Corms should therefore be potted as soon as you receive them according to the cultural information you will receive with your corms.
Keep at a temperature of around 16°C. Keep compost moist, pot on as necessary, preferably with a soil based compost, e.g. John Innes No. 2. Removal of the first flower buds when the plant is small will mean larger flowers later on.

Tropical Hibiscus are native to China but are widely grown throughout the tropics & sub-tropics where they can reach up to 2m. They are tender in Britain and grown as
house/conservatory plants where they can be kept in check with pruning and if grown in good, natural daylight have large, showy flowers through summer & autumn.

Our range of Conservatory plants give a cross section of colour and scents for year round interest. Most tender shrubs and climbers can be grown in containers of varying sizes and types outside for the summer months and then transferred back into the conservatory for the winter.
In some cases however, tender plants are kept in the conservatory and wall trained or grown to provide a canopy to shade other plants and to create an environment that is comfortable to live with.

These easy to grow perennials come in an assortment of colours and are suitable for both dry shade or full sun. Exceptionally hardy, they are ideal cottage garden plants
for mixed borders and can make great companions for ferns in shady spots, giving colour where it is much needed.
