Your privacy is important to us. Whenever you place an order online, your information is protected using SSL encryption. Please read below to learn more about what we do with the information we collect from you when you sign up for an account or place an order.
What Information Does Micro Fence Collect?
When you place an order with Micro Fence, we need to know your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing address, phone number, credit card number, expiration date, and Card Verification Code (CVC). This allows us to process and fulfill your order, and notify you of your order status. Your phone number will also be used to contact you if there is a question regarding your order.
What Does Micro Fence do with it?
When you provide your mailing address, you will automatically be added to our newsletter mailing list. If you prefer not to receive it, select that option when you sign up. You may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events.
When you provide us with your email address, you may also receive periodic mailings from us with special sales, discounts, new products, and upcoming trade shows in your area.
Micro Fence understands how annoying it is to see your inbox fill up with unwanted advertisements, so rest assured we will do our best to make sure we only contact you when it is important (for instance, a great coupon, sale, or trade show in your area). Email addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. If you wish to be removed from any mailing list, contact us at microfence@microfence.com.
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Micro Fence. Changes to this policy will be reflected on this page. If you ever have any concerns about how we use your information, please feel free to contact us at microfence@microfence.com or call us at 800.480.6427.
