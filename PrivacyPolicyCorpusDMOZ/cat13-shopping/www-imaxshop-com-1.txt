We may from time to time use other third parties for similar type tracking services. Any information we track in this manner is anonymous, limited to usage and volume statistics, and is used to provide insight into the effectiveness of our online marketing initiatives and strategies.
Also, like many Web sites, we use “cookies”, which are files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your browser. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.
