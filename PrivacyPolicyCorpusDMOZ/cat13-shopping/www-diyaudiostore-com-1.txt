Terms Of Service
Terms Of Service
Definition of Terms
Throughout this document you refers to you, the purchaser of products and services and customer of DIYAUDIO LLC. We and Our refers to ourselves, the seller of products and services, operating as a business under the name DIYAUDIO LLC and the website www.diyaudiostore.com.
Returning Purchased Items
Please see our Shipping and Returns information page.
Payment
Our store is powered by Shopify, and all payments are processed by them. We only accept credit cards (see note about PayPal below). Depending on which country you live in you will see different payment options available and they may change from time to time. Whatever you see available as an option is what is available.
Shopify has some pretty strict anti-fraud prevention stuff going on, and it's not uncommon for customers in tricky countries, or even in the EU proper, to experience rejection of their credit cards. If that happens, please understand it's nothing personal, just a sad fact of modern day eCommerce that there's a lot of fraud going on. Shopify trains its algorithms on the transaction and fraud history of millions of purchases across hundreds of thousands of the stores they process transactions for. Things that can impact the anti-fraud checks are things like billing versus delivery address, using a proxy, whose name the card is in, where you are placing your order, and which phase the moon is in.
We don't accept PayPal anymore as PayPal's fees are much higher than credit cards, especially for international orders. For some international orders, the fee on goods + postage was up to 7%. The sneaky thing PayPal does is ban merchants from charging a surcharge for the extra costs of accepting PayPal. We don't want to make all our customers pay increased product prices, but if you would like to pay with PayPal we do have a solution for you that requires some manual work to cover these extra fees, just contact the helpdesk and we'll explain how you can pay with PayPal.
Wire transfers and western union are possibilities but will incur hefty admin/receiving fees so we recommend you try to find a friend with a credit card instead of considering those options.
Technical Support & Contact Information
The diyAudio community contains people of all levels of experience and knowledge. Here at the helpdesk our experience and knowledge is very specifically in creating a great online shopping experience and delivering you what you paid for. For this reason we provide two paths for you to obtain support:
Non-technical (orders/shipping) assistance: For all store and order related inquiries please email our helpdesk
Technical (electronics theory) assistance: Please head over to where the really smart electronics gurus are in the diyAudio Store forum on diyAudio and ask your question in a thread there. For most products there is a very specific thread on diyAudio (normally linked to from the product page), and that's the best place to post any electronics theory related questions.
Safety
Technology and the laws and limitations imposed by manufacturers and content owners are constantly changing. Thus, some of the projects described may not work, may be inconsistent with current laws or user agreements, or may damage or adversely affect some equipment. Your safety is your own responsibility, including proper use of equipment and safety gear, and determining whether you have adequate skill and experience. Power tools, electricity, and other resources used for these projects are dangerous, unless used properly and with adequate precautions, including safety gear. Tube related projects typically involve deadly high voltages and must be treated with commensurate respect.
Some illustrative photos do not depict safety precautions or equipment, in order to show the project steps more clearly. These projects are not intended for use by children. Use of the instructions, kits, projects and suggestions on diyAudio, the diyAudio Store, guides.diyaudio.com or any related website is at your own risk. DIYAUDIO LLC disclaims all responsibility for any resulting damage, injury, or expense. It is your responsibility to make sure that your activities comply with applicable laws, including copyright. Always check the webpage associated with each project before you get started. There may be important updates or corrections!
The United States Fire Administration (USFA) has a guide and many simple steps you can take to prevent the loss of life and property resulting from electrical fires. Click here to read them! If you feel uncomfortable with assembling any project or kit, simply contact us to return it for a full refund.
Third-Party Links
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may link to sites operated by third parties. However, we have no control over these linked sites. If you use these links, you will leave the diyAudio Store, and we are not responsible for any content, materials or other information located on the linked website. If you decide to check out any of the linked websites, you do so entirely at your own risk.
Privacy
We store your phone number, order history, email, shipping and billing addresses in your user account. All payment information is handled by our payments processor, Shopify. DIYAUDIO LLC does not keep your credit card on file. User information is only used to ship goods and contact you in case of an order or shipping issue. We do not, and will never, sell or give any of your information to any third-party or send you any unsolicited advertisements. Please view our complete privacy & legal policy.
Accuracy of Information
We attempt to ensure that information on the diyAudio Store is complete, accurate and current. Due to the large number of products we have, it is very hard to maintain documentation for every one. We cannot, therefore, guarantee that all information on this site is complete or current.
Export Compliance
You hereby acknowledges that the products and services delivered under this Agreement are subject to applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including without limit those of the United States (e.g., the sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR Part 500 et seq.), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, laws and regulations targeting proliferation activities, and the restricted parties lists maintained by the U.S. government (e.g., the Denied Persons List, Unverified List, Entity List, Specially Designated Nationals List, Debarred List and Non-proliferation Sanctions)). Customer agrees to comply with these laws and regulations and certifies that it will not use, sell, resell, export, re-export, import, dispose of, disclose or otherwise deal with the products or services delivered under this Agreement, directly or indirectly, to any country, destination or party without first obtaining any required export license or other governmental approval, and completing such formalities as may be required. Customer further agrees to not do anything which would cause DIYAUDIO LLC to be in breach of the export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations.
Indemnification
You shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless DIYAUDIO LLC, its owners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents from any fines, damages, costs, losses, liabilities, fees, penalties, claims and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by DIYAUDIO LLC as a result of the failure of the Customer or its agents, officers, directors or employees to comply with this Section.
Shipments sent via DHL eCommerce International Parcel Direct Delivered Duty Paid
The goods will be imported on behalf of the consignee/ebuyer. The consignee authorizes DIYAUDIO LLC to import the goods on his behalf. Further, the consignee/buyer agrees that DIYAUDIO LLC may delegate the obligation to import the goods on his behalf to a subcontractor (e.g. customs broker). The consignee will pay the taxes & duties in addition with the purchase price of the goods.
Domestic Shipments
In the event you request delivery to a U.S. destination, you acknowledge that you alone are responsible for determining the applicable export licensing requirements and obtaining any required authorizations for subsequent transfers. If you are not a U.S. Principal Party in Interest and request delivery to a U.S. consignee for purposes of facilitating an export, you also hereby (1) confirm your responsibility for export clearance and filing Electronic Export Information with U.S. Census Bureau, (2) authorize the specified consignee to prepare and file Electronic Export Information on its behalf so as to create a “routed export transaction”, as defined in the Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR Part 30) and EAR, and (3) agrees to provide DIYAUDIO LLC a copy of the signed written assurance designating the authorized forwarding agent.
