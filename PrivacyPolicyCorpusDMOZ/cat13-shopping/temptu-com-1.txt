TEMPTU.com Refer-A-Friend Program
As a Refer-A-Friend member, you are subject to these Terms and TEMPTU’s Privacy Policy (which can be accessed at http://temptu.com/privacy-policy), as well as the following additional terms and conditions for TEMPTU’s Refer-A-Friend program:
Qualified Referral.  A “Qualified Referral” is the purchase of a TEMPTU AIRbrush System Kit made at www.temptu.com by a person (a "Referred Customer") who arrives at the Site via another person’s (the “Referrer”) Refer-A-Friend program link.  The Referred Customer and the Referrer cannot be the same person (for example, by using a different email address).
Referral Rewards and Payments.  The Referrer earns a referral reward of $25 (a “Referral Reward”) for each Qualified Referral.  Referral Rewards will be payable only in the form of a TEMPTU.com E-giftcard and will be emailed to the Referrer within fifteen (15) days of an order that meets the criteria for a Qualified Referral.  Referral rewards cannot be redeemed or exchanged for cash.  No more than fifty (50) Qualified Referrals may be earned by a Referrer per calendar year.  The Referrer is responsible for any and all tax liability resulting from a redeemed Referral Reward.  In the event of a return or cancellation of an order that resulted in a Referral Reward, the amount of such Referral Reward will be cancelled if has not yet been redeemed, or will be deducted from the Referrer’s account, if such Referral Reward was already redeemed.
No Spam.  Referrers must comply with all up-to-date “SPAM” laws.  For example, emails from a Referrer to potential Referred Customers must be created and distributed in a personal manner and bulk email distribution is strongly discouraged.  Any distribution of a Refer-A-Friend program link by a Referrer that could constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam” under any applicable law or regulation is expressly prohibited and will be grounds for immediate termination of the Referrer’s account and deactivation of the Referrer’s Refer-a-Friend program link.
Right to Cancel Program.  TEMPTU reserves the right to close the account(s) of any Referrer and/or Referred Customer and to request proper payment if the Referrer and/or Referred Customer attempts to use the TEMPTU Refer-a-Friend program in a questionable manner or breaches any of these Terms or is in violation of any law, statute or governmental regulation.
Right to Cancel Program or Change Terms.  TEMPTU reserves the right to cancel the Refer-a-Friend Program or to change these Terms at any time in its sole discretion.  Any unclaimed Referral Rewards will be forfeited at that time.
