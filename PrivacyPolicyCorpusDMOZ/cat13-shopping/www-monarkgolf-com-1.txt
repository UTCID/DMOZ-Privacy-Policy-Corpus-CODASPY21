Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online. All Monark e-mails are intended to comply with federal regulations.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your user ID and password. To make any address changes or other modifications to your Monark account information, please send email to info@monarkgolf.com or call 1-877-551-4653.
E-mail Policy:
We collect the email addresses of those who voluntarily provide it those us, either via telephone, e-mail or when ordering online. We cannot obtain your email address unless you voluntarily provide it to us, or we obtain it from a service company that has confirmed your willingness to distribute it.

Cookies:
Like most e-retail web sites, we use "cookies," which are pieces of data given to your browser that allow our web site to identify you when you access our site. Cookies cannot extract any information about you that you have not already revealed voluntarily. The vast majority of internet users now appreciate cookies as a convenience feature for shopping online.
Site Traffic Data:
Our computers collect and store certain data from your visits to our web site. The information we collect from this site traffic helps us to make the site easier to navigate and to improve your shopping experience at www.MonarkGolf.com. We do not share or distribute any specific customer site traffic data to any other parties.
Security Policy:
Monark's website is secured by third-party encryption, which allows our customers to submit information online with the assurance that they are really doing business with Monark (not an impostor's "spoof " site) and that the information they send (such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data) is protected from interception or alteration over the Web
Our web site uses industry-standard 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your name, address, and credit card number. Encryption is a process wherein we scramble your order information so it cannot be read by anyone other than Monark Golf, even if it is wrongly intercepted en route to us. Using a security-enabled browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, versions 4.06 or greater) will enable you to take advantage of our site's data encryption feature.
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Customer's credit card details are encrypted by PayPal and not accessible by Seller, i.e. Seller has no chance to see or review Buyer's card details. For internet orders Seller does not keep, nor save, nor store any Buyer's card details, payments are processed by PayPal, not by Seller.
Monark wants all of our customers to feel comfortable when they pay for merchandise or services, whether ordered by telephone, fax, or across the Internet. If you would feel more comfortable placing your order by phone, please call toll free 877 551 4653 (in the U.S.A) or 909 598 5443 (from outside the U.S.) Monday to Friday  from 8:30am to 5:00pm Pacific Standard Time, or send a fax 24/7 to our secured fax line 909 598 5444.
If you have any questions regarding any of the elements of our web Privacy Policy, please email us at info@monarkgolf.com or call our Customer Service line at (877) 551 4653.
