Information Collection and Use
The Flying Mule collects personal information when you purchase or
products, register for one of our services, and when you enter contests or

From time to time, The Flying Mule may use the information you provide us to
send you newsletters, updates about our services, and special offers on
products. You may opt out of these lists at the time you register or make a
purchase, or you may opt out afterwards by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link
at the bottom of any email contacts, or by sending email
to “unsubscribe@flyingmule.com.”
The Flying Mule also automatically receives information from your browser,
and records this information on our server logs. This information may include
your IP address, The Flying Mule cookie information and the page(s) you
requested during your visit. This information is currently used only to supply
you with personalized access to our services, and to make statistical
recordings of generic site access information.

without your permission. We will only share this information about you with
other companies when we have your express consent to do so, or when we need to

company that receives your information from us, unless we have expressly
informed you otherwise, does not have the right to use your information beyond
what is necessary to assist us with your request. We may also provide your
information if it is subpoenaed or required by a court order or legal
process.
