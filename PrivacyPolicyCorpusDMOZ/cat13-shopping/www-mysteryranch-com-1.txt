Effective date: October 5th, 2020At Mystery Ranch, we respect your right to keep your personal information private. We wrote this Privacy Policy to make sure you understand the type of information we collect, when we collect it, how we use it, and finally your rights to access it. This information may be collected through the mail, Mystery Ranch’s retail store and wholesale accounts, MysteryRanch.com and other websites that link to this Privacy Policy, and any mobile services or applications offered by Mystery Ranch.In sum, this Privacy Policy explains: 1) what information Mystery Ranch and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies (collectively, "Mystery Ranch", "we", or "us") collects and why we collect it; 2) how we use this information; and, 3) how you can access this information, update it, or correct it.Please read this policy carefully!What Information We Collect and Why We Collect ItPersonally Identifiable Information ("PII")Depending on how you interact with our website, we may need to collect "personally identifiable information" ("PII"). This PII can include information such as your name, your contact information, your shipping information, and your billing information (such as credit card account data). We may also collect “non-personally identifiable information” (“Non-PII”), which is information that cannot be directly associated with you.We collect PII when you provide it to us through your use of MysteryRanch.com (e.g. when you create an account, purchase a product, sign up for our email newsletter, etc.) or when you call in an order to our customer service team and give any personally identifiable information over the phone to an employee or contractor of Mystery Ranch. Note: This also applies to individual and bulk custom OEM orders placed through MysteryRanch.com or a call-in order.In addition, we may combine the PII and Non-PII we collect from you with additional information provided by third-parties (such as signing up for or linking a Google or Facebook account). While we would never consciously collect or obtain data about our customers in an unethical manner, we will not be held responsible if we inadvertently obtain data from a third-party source that was collected in an unethical manner. However, if we learn that any third-party PII was collected unethically, we will cease using such data and will take steps to prevent our collecting that PII again. Please contact a Mystery Ranch customer service representative if you think your PII was provided to or collected from a third-party in an unethical manner.Finally, we will not collect your PII unless you give us express or implied consent to do so in the first place. For more information on the differences between express vs. implied consent, check out this website provided by Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) enforcement agency: www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/infograph.htm.If you decide you would like us to stop collecting your PII, simply contact a Mystery Ranch customer service representative or click here. We will also seek to comply with customer Do Not Track (DNT) requests submitted through their web browsers pursuant to the California Online Privacy and Protection Act (CalOPPA). You can learn more about submitting such DNT requests within your web browser here: https://termsfeed.com/do-not-track.Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII")As we mentioned above, Non-PII is information that cannot be directly associated with you.

Our advertisers and ad servicers may also collect Non-PII outside Mystery Ranch services to measure the success of our digital advertising campaigns. We use the Non-PII that we collect for a variety of purposes such as to provide and improve Mystery Ranch services, to prevent fraudulent access to and hacking of our website, and to analyze and improve our advertising to provide the most relevant messages to our current and potential customers.The PII we collect is used to provide, analyze, and improve our services (e.g. process, fulfill, and ship orders, respond to customer service requests, make changes to current orders, etc.) and to conduct marketing across print and digital mediums.

While our marketing email provider has access to email addresses and email activity and may share bulk/non-specific activity data (e.g. Non-PII), no email addresses, specific email actions, or other PII are ever shared with other third parties. Should a consumer wish to “opt out” of this sharing, that consumer simply needs to opt out of marketing email from us and will be promptly removed from all email lists.
