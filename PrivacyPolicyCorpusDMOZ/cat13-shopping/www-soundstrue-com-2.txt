Sounds True - Terms and Conditions
Terms of Use
Welcome to SoundsTrue.com (our “Site”), the internet marketing arm of Sounds True, Inc. (“Sounds True,” “we,” “our,” and “us”). If you use or order from our Site, you agree to our Terms of Use. The information contained in this Site, including but not limited to these Terms of Use, is subject to change without notice. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the rules as changed. Sounds True creates and controls this Site from its offices in Louisville, CO, USA, and if your orders are accepted, they will be accepted in Colorado. By using this Site, you agree that Colorado law will govern these Terms of Use and your relations with Sounds True, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. If you do not agree, please do not use this Site. If you choose to access this Site from another location, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
Privacy
Use of information that we collect from you on this Site is governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms of Use.
Age of Users
Our Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Site or on or through any of its features, register on the Site, make any purchases through the Site, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Site, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use.
If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@soundstrue.com.
Content Errors
Prices and availability of products are subject to change without notice. Our goal is to provide only up-to-date and accurate information to our customers. But mistakes happen and occasionally product descriptions on our Site or in our catalog may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions concerning product specifications, prices, or availability, and product photos may sometimes depict a different product version than the one we will ship. We reserve the right to correct and update information on our Site at any time, without notice. We also reserve the right to revoke any offer that contains an error, or for a product that is not available, at any time prior to shipment, including after you have submitted an order and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. In that event, we will reverse any applicable charges that have been made to your credit card, and if the product is or will be available we will attempt to contact you concerning the mistake to receive your instructions as to whether you wish to purchase on the basis of the corrected information. If you believe a product that we ship to you is not as described, you may return it to us under our Return Policy.
Account Registration
If you establish an electronic account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and for restricting access to the computer(s) you have used to place orders.
Subscriptions
If you have purchased a subscription product (such as A Year of Mindfulness, Mindfulness Monthly, or Year of Ceremony), your credit card will be charged approximately every 30 days. Your monthly recurring payment will continue until canceled. You may cancel at any time by contacting our Customer Service department at support@soundstrue.com; phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).
Installment Payment Plans
Sounds True may offer an option to make a purchase utilizing an installment payment plan for certain products. Please be advised that the sum of the installment payments may exceed the product price payable if the entire payment had been made at the time of purchase. The additional cost of the installment payment plan is intended to cover Sounds True’s cost to manage the installment payment plan.
Your credit card will be charged approximately every 30 days until the product is paid for in full. Payment is not complete until the final installment payment is received. Should your credit card be declined, an email will be sent offering you the opportunity to remedy the payment. Failure to correct the payment could result in losing access to the product.
Shopping Security
Orders that you submit are protected by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) as described in our Privacy Policy.
Payment for Orders
We accept Visa®, MasterCard®, AmericanExpress®, and Discover® card numbers in payment of orders, as well as Sounds True gift cards, PayPal, and Shop Pay. Our shipping charges are described at Shipping and Services.
Validating or Rejecting Your Order
After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you provide to verify availability of your method of payment or shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address or other contact information you have given us with the order. Your credit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if a charge has been made against your card.
Order Acceptance and Confirmation
Your orders are only accepted by shipment of the item(s). Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not create a contract to sell you the product. Sounds True reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason prior to shipment.
Canadian Orders
By placing an order destined for delivery to Canada, duties and taxes must be remitted to Canada and are the customer’s responsibility. Sounds True will return the purchase price directly to the customer only. Shipping & Service and Brokerage Fees are nonrefundable.
Electronic Communications
If you give us your email address when you order on our Site, we will send an email confirmation that we have received your order. Other ways in which we may use your email address and ways to opt out of receiving emails not related to your order are described in our Privacy Policy. When you visit our Site, place an order, or send us an email, you are communicating with us electronically. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically, whether by email or posting them on this Site, satisfy any legal requirement that such communication be in writing. These Terms of Use create a binding agreement between us, without need for signature of either side.
Your Feedback and Suggestions
Your opinions matter, and we encourage you to email us at support@soundstrue.com with suggestions for improving our products and services. Unless we have entered into a written contract signed by both sides concerning use of your ideas before you disclose them, you agree that we may use your voluntary submissions at our sole discretion and have no obligation to pay you for them.
Referrals and Affiliates
Sounds True receives referrals of customers through hyperlinks from a large number of affiliates, who may earn commissions on resulting sales. Websites operated by these affiliates are not owned by Sounds True, and we have no control over, and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the content, operation, or business practices of, such affiliates or their websites. If you arrive at our Site through a link from an affiliate, you should review that affiliate's privacy policy to learn if and how the affiliate will collect and use information about you.

Warranty Disclaimers
Our Site and its products and services are provided on an "As Is" and "As Available" basis, with all faults. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Sounds True disclaims all implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Disputes
You agree that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, courts located in Boulder County, Colorado, will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction for any litigation arising out of your use of this Site and products you order on this Site. You submit to personal jurisdiction of any such court and waive any claims that the forum is inconvenient or the court does not have jurisdiction.

To the extent that you attempt to assert any such claim, you hereby expressly agree to present such claim only through binding arbitration conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association to occur in Boulder County, Colorado.

eGift Cards
eGift Cards are the simplest, speediest way to send something special. Our eGift Cards are purchased just like any other item in our store. You choose the amount, add a personalized message, and the card will be delivered right to your inbox where you can treat yourself or you can send it to someone as a gift. eGift Cards include your personalized message and a gift code in a lovely layout.
Please keep in mind:
* We offer electronic gift cards only; we do not mail out physical cards to recipients. * We recommend that you purchase gift cards directly from our Site and retain your receipt. We cannot guarantee the validity of gift cards purchased from third parties, especially from third-party online marketplaces where scams are common. Gift cards that have been stolen or fraudulently acquired are subject to cancellation by Sounds True regardless of whether you purchased the gift card from the third party without knowing it was stolen. Here are some common questions about our eGift Cards and the answers to them:
Are there any fees associated with the purchase of an eGift Card?
No. You will only be charged the face value of the eGift Card, and we will not impose any shipping, taxes, or additional fees.
Can I change the value of an eGift Card after I've paid for it?
Not at this time.
How do I cancel the purchase of an eGift Card?
Your eGift Card is not returnable after purchase (except as required by law) and cannot be canceled.
What are the minimum and maximum dollar amounts I can purchase for eGift Cards?
The minimum is $15; the maximum is $150. However, if you wish to purchase an eGift Card for more than $150, please contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).
When is my credit card charged for my purchase?
Your credit card is charged at the time of purchase.
What exactly does the recipient receive when I send an eGift Card?
On the delivery date you choose, an email is sent to the recipient informing them of your gift, with the eGift Card you created, your personalized message, its value, and a code number. The email also gives simple instructions for redeeming the eGift Card.
When is the eGift Card sent to the recipient?
The eGift Card email is sent to the recipient on the date you choose. It can be sent immediately or scheduled to be sent up to one year in the future.
When does the eGift Card expire?
The eGift Card expires five years after the initial purchase date.
Where can I redeem my eGift Card?
You can use your eGift Card at SoundsTrue.com on any Sounds True product (excluding live events, monthly subscriptions, or Continuing Education credits). You can apply the gift card balance to your shopping cart at checkout and will be prompted for additional payment if your total exceeds your gift card balance.
Do gift card purchases qualify for special offers or promotions?
No, the purchase of eGift Cards does not count toward the purchase amount required to be eligible for free shipping or promotional offers.
Can I use the eGift Card to purchase Sounds True products on other websites (such as Amazon)?
No, not at this time.
Can I add value to my eGift Card?
No, not at this time.
How do I know the recipient actually received the eGift Card I purchased?
You will receive an email message confirming delivery.
If I want to return a product I bought with an eGift Card, will I receive another eGift Card?
No, the refund goes back on the original eGift Card and the expiration date remains the same. If you used an eGift Card and credit card for the order (because the total price exceeded the amount of the eGift Card), the refund goes back to the eGift Card before the credit card.
What if I lose my eGift Card?
Please contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).
I’m having trouble using my eGift Card. Who should I contact?
Please contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).
I purchased an eGift Card as a gift for someone, but they haven’t received it yet. What should I do?
Please contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).
Do you sell physical gift cards?
No, not at this time.
