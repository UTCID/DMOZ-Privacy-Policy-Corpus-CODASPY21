How That Information Is Used:
TRN Music Publisher, Inc. only uses the necessary personal information such as mailing addresses, email addresses, first and last names, and phone numbers for business transactions.

Our Commitment To The Security of Your Data
It is very common and pretty much standard practice that internet browsing software like Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome automatically sends anonymous information such as the internet domain name (like http://trnmusic.com) the user came from and which browser software version the user has (such as Firefox, Google Chrome), however, this type of information DOES NOT include personal information such as the visitor's e-mail address or name. This type of automatic and general statistical information is only used to decide what website features are the most popular and which ones are not, and helps provide the user with a better overall experience. An example of this would be gathering statistics about whether you are using a screen resolution etc. We will certainly do everything in our power to make sure you and your information is protected.
Credit card information:
Credit Card information is transmitted by our customers via secure encryption technology SSL.
Transmission over the Internet:
Users who may have concerns about the privacy of their information have the option of placing orders using our toll-free telephone and fax numbers, or even snail mail (listed below):
