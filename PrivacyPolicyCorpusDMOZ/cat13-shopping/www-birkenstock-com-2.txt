When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.

Disputes: Mandatory Arbitration, Class Action Waiver, Jury Trial Waiver
Our Customer Service Specialists are ready to assist you and address your concerns—email info@support.birkenstockusa.com or call (844) 505-4055 (toll-free).
In the event that our customer service team is unable to resolve your concern, by using this Site you unconditionally agree that all claims relating to your access or use of our Site, including all disputes arising out of, or related to, any products or services purchased from BUSA through this Site, will be resolved solely through binding individual arbitration, rather than in court. You may also assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims otherwise qualify. You and BUSA both further agree that we may each bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you may send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: C T Corporation System, 818 West Seventh Street, Suite 930, Los Angeles, CA 90017. You agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (‘AAA’), https://www.adr.org, or 1.800.778.7879. You can contact AAA to find out more information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s applicable rules. BUSA will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000. Likewise, BUSA will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed-upon location.
CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and BUSA agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, consolidated, aggregated, representative or collective action basis. The arbitrator shall be empowered only to hear and determine an individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and BUSA each waives any right to a jury trial or to bring a class, consolidated, aggregated, representative or collective action against the other.
ARBITRATIONS AND COURT ACTIONS DIFFER. An arbitrator is able to award damages and other relief, including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages. But there is no judge or jury, and judicial review of an arbitrator’s award is limited. Discovery in arbitration is also limited in accord with AAA rules. In addition, as set forth above, you are waiving any ability for an arbitrator to oversee or determine class, consolidated, aggregated, representative or collective actions.
IMPORTANT: THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, AGGREGATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES THAT YOU OR BUSA WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
Applicable Law
The law applicable to the interpretation and construction of these Terms of Use and access to or use of this Site (including purchases made on this Site), or related to this Site in any way, shall be the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, but subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal law relating to the arbitrability of claims.
Site Policies, Modification and Severability
Please review our other policies posted on this Site. These policies also govern your use of BUSA services and products. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies and these Terms of Use at any time and may provide notice of such changes in our discretion or as required by law. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

Termination

BUSA also may terminate this Agreement at any time and may do so immediately without notice, and accordingly deny you access to the Site, if in BUSA's sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement.
