Return Policy ALL SALES FINAL.    NO RETURNS Returns for Insurance Claims Our normal shipper is UPS.
UPS has specific regulations
for returns of damaged goods.
If you do not follow the directions
specifically, there will be no insurance payment from UPS and I cannot
refund your money nor replace your goods.
Please follow the directions
given to you when you contact us about damaged shipments.
Here's the
normal procedure:
When you receive a package from UPS and it is damaged, you must CALL UPS
to tell them the package arrived in damaged condition.
You must put
the item back in the original packaging and UPS will come to your home
to pick it up at no cost to you.
If you follow these instructions, UPS
will pay the insurance claim and there will be no problem.
If you
return the item by paying for shipping yourself, the insurance on the
original shipment is voided and there will be no payment, so I cannot
replace your damaged piece.
I can only replace your piece if the insurance has been paid, so my costs are covered.  Please follow these instructions carefully
-- it's simple to do, the UPS number is usually right on the box.
You
can also contact me for information Lynda@thesculptedhorse.com if you receive a damaged item.
