However, if Meyer Distributing sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or Meyer Distributing (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Meyer Distributing may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.
