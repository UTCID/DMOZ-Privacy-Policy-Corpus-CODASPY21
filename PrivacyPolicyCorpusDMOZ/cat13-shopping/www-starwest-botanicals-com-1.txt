Is ordering online safe?
Shopping at Starwest-Botanicals.com is safe.
When placing an order or browsing your account information on our site, the transmission information is encrypted using the best available Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the most secure encryption technology currently available for electronic transactions.
We use the same networks that retail stores use when you make a credit card purchase in person and we never store your credit card data.
It's sent directly to our credit card processor, and we use a token then provide us (it's just random numbers and letters that are of no use to anyone else) to capture payment.
To read more about the steps we take to ensure the safety and privacy of your online shopping experience, please read our Privacy & Security Policy.

Can I place my order by telephone?
Yes.
While placing an order online will make it easier for you to track the status of your order, you are welcome to call and place your order over the phone.
You can call us at 1-800-800-4372 between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM PST, Monday through Friday.

Why am I only allowed to choose a limited quantity?

I'm having trouble logging in!
If you're an existing user, please login here. If you forgot your password, please use this form to reset it. If you are a wholesale customer, please visit our wholesale website.

My preferred shipping method isn't available!
Most likely you have added a flammable item to your cart. Due to FAA restrictions, we cannot ship essential oils or liquid extracts via air freight. All packages containing these items must be shipped ground. If you wish to expedite the rest of your shipment, please place a separate order for the items you wish to expedite.
Back To Top
What methods of payment does Starwest accept?
For online retail orders, we accept MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express.
For payment options on wholesale orders, please read our Wholesale Policies.
Back To Top
Does Starwest charge sales tax?
The taxability of retail orders is determined by the ship to state and the items ordered, and will be reflected at checkout. Tax can also be estimated in the shopping cart, by entering your city, state and zip.
For wholesale orders, we will need a valid sales tax exemption on file, or they will also be subject to tax, based on your location and the items being ordered. Customers shipping to California can be exempt from being charged sales tax by submitting a Certificate of Resale form and/or California Seller's Permit. For more information on sending us your California Seller’s Permit number, including the necessary form, click here.
If you are in another state where tax is collected, we will provide a link to fill out your exemption information online.

What do I do if my order was damaged during shipment?
We go to great lengths to ensure that your order is correct, properly packaged, and well protected.
Despite our best efforts, damage sometimes occurs during shipment.
We strongly recommend that you always inspect your shipment before signing.
If any exterior damage is visible, we recommend that you refuse shipment; if there is interior damage, please contact us immediately.
Back To Top
How do I know my order was received?
When you place your order online you will see a printable confirmation at the end of the checkout process to verify that your order has been received.
You will also receive an email confirming the receipt of your order shortly after your order has been placed.
All orders placed through our website will also be listed under ‘Order History’ when you log into your Starwest-Botanicals.com account.
Back To Top
How do I check the status of my order?
You can check the status of your order at any time by logging into your Starwest-Botanicals.com account.
If you aren’t already logged into your account, do so using the ‘login’ at the top of our site.
Once logged in, select the ‘Order History’ option at the top of our site.

Are the pictures of your herbs, spices, and loose leaf teas indicative of what I will receive?
While all bulk herb, spice, and loose leaf tea photos were taken of products from our warehouse, please keep in mind that these are natural products, and characteristics (such as color) will vary from lot to lot.
We take great pride in offering the best quality natural products from sources around the world and guarantee your satisfaction 100%.
If you are unhappy, for any reason, with the product you receive, you can return it for a full refund or credit.
Back To Top
What is the shelf life of herbs and spices?
While herbs and spices generally don’t spoil, they will lose their potency over time.
How the herbs and spices are stored will play a large role in how long they retain their potency.
If stored in airtight containers, such as glass jars, and kept in a cool, dark, dry place, whole herbs and spices can last up to 3-4 years and ground herbs and spices can last 1-2 years.
We make every effort to ensure that you receive well-preserved herbs and spices.
We use polyfoil bags with a resealable ziplock closure, which protect the contents from exposure to light and moisture, to preserve the freshness, aroma, and potency of our products.
