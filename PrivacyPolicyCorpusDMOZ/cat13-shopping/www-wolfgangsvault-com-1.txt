If a purchase has been declined online due to credit card issues, please ensure all data is correct and resubmit. If the transaction is not accepted online, you will be unable to use that card for your purchase and should use another credit card.

Any change in membership benefits will take effect on the date specified by Wolfgang’s.
Changes in membership benefits will not entitle you to any refund of any or all of your Paid Music Membership and will not give you the right to terminate your membership, unless the change is a material reduction in benefits that is instituted voluntarily by Wolfgang’s and not as a result of any changes in laws, government policies, increases in costs and fees payable to third parties or other circumstances outside the control of Wolfgang’s.
