Your desire for privacy. DVDEmpire's Privacy Policy can be found at here.
By using the Websites, You are consenting to the processing of Your data by DVDEmpire and consenting to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If we decide to make any significant change to that policy, we will post the revised policy prominently on the Websites or otherwise bring it to Your attention, so that You are always aware of what we do with Your information.11. Site SecurityYou are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Websites, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which You are not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Websites, overloading, "flooding," "spamming," "mailbombing" or "crashing;" (d) sending unsolicited email, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; or (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting.
Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
DVDEmpire will investigate occurrences that may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enf-rcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such violations.
You agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Websites or any activity being conducted on the Websites.
You agree, further, not to use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Websites other than the search engine and search agents available from DVDEmpire on the Websites and other than generally available third party web browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer).12. Termination of UseDVDEmpire, in its sole discretion, may terminate Your password, Your account, Your use of any of the on-line resources available on the Websites, and remove and discard any Content on the Websites, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if DVDEmpire believes that You have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms.
Any termination of Your access to the Websites under any provision of the Terms may be effected without prior notice, and DVDEmpire may immediately de-activate or delete Your account and all related information and files in Your account and/or bar any further access to such files or to the Websites.
Further, DVDEmpire will not be liable to You or any third-party for any termination or suspension of Your Account or Your access to the Websites.13. General InformationThe Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and DVDEmpire and govern Your use of the Websites, superseding any prior agreements between You and DVDEmpire (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms).
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use other DVDEmpire services, third-party content or third-party software. You must not assign or otherwise transfer either the Terms or any right granted hereunder.Any breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to DVDEmpire for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, DVDEmpire will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs.
You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if DVDEmpire seeks such an injunction. Pennsylvania law and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms.
No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction apply.
You and DVDEmpire agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Allegheny, Pennsylvania. DVDEmpire controls and operates the Websites from its headquarters in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States of America, and makes no representation that this Content is appropriate or available for use in other locations. If You use the Websites from other locations, You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws including but not limited to the export and import regulations of other countries. The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of technology originating in the United States.
This includes the electronic transmission of information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals.
You agree to abide by these laws and their regulations including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Act and the Arms Export Control Act and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the Website to either a foreign national or a foreign destination in violation of such laws. The failure of DVDEmpire to exercise or enf-rce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full f-rce and effect.
REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.
The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms represent the entire understanding relating to the use of the Websites and prevail over any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting, or additional, communications.Contact Us if you have any comments about our Terms of Use.
