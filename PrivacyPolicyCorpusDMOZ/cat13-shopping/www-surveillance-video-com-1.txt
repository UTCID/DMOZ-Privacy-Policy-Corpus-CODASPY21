Privacy Policy
Information Collection & Use
Surveillance Video is the sole owner of the information collected on www.Surveillance-Video.com. Surveillance Video collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
We collect personally identifiable information on our site at places including Become A Dealer, Request A Quote, Contact Us, Catalogue Request and Newsletter sign up. We collect information such as name, address, email address, business name, etc.
Surveys or Contests
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes and to monitor site traffic.
We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing.
Forward To A Friend
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Surveillance Video does not store this information.
Message Board/Forum and BLOG
If you use our message board/forum or blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Please note that although you will be on hostingprod.com’s site when on our BLOG, our privacy policy governs the collection and use of your data while on our BLOG.
Note that we also have a member list function within our Forum. Members automatically are included in this list. They can, however, choose to have their email remain private when signing up for the forum. Much of the information collected during registration is optional. Personal information is used only if a member needs to be contacted for any reason and is not given out to any third parties.
Uses of Information
Surveillance Video collects information that users submit for the purposes of shipping and billing of a customer’s order. Surveillance Users can sign up to receive periodic newsletters; this process includes the submittal of a user’s email address. Personal information is also collected when a user requests a quote in order to reply to that user. Information is collected when users apply for dealer status in order to verify that said users are resellers. Personal information is collected when users sign up for a catalog request in order to facilitate this request.
Communications from the Site
Special Offers and Updates We will occasionally send you information on special deals and promotions. You can sign up for these offers by sending an email toinfo@Surveillance-Video.com.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.”
Newsletters
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
You may opt-out of these communications. Please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
Customer Service
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)
We do not share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.
We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
Personally identifiable information:
We Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties. This sharing occurs when we ship your order and when we process your credit card. We also use a third party for web hosting.
Agents
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
Service Providers
We use other third parties to provide hosting services for our Web site. We will share contact information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing.
Legal Disclaimer
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
Choice/Opt-out
Users must choose to sign up for the newsletter; it is not automatically sent to them. Surveys are also optional.
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at info@Surveillance-Video.com.
You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.
Log Files

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Cookies

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
