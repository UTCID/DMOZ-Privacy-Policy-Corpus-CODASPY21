Collection
Categories
of Individual Data Subjects
In general, Radial may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about
several different types of individuals, including consumers, Clients (defined
below), suppliers and other business partners. Radial's practices with respect
to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.
Consumers
Radial provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business
clients (each, a "Client") that facilitate services for their
customers ("Consumers"). In these cases, personal data collected from
Consumers is owned by the applicable Client, and Radial processes this data on
the Client's behalf. There may be limited instances in which Radial owns and processes
personal data collected from Consumers on its own behalf, rather than on behalf
of a Client. In all instances, Radial will obtain access to EU Personal Data
about Consumers in the course of operating websites, processing payments,
fulfilling orders, implementing marketing campaigns and providing customer care
and other related services. Such data may include, name, billing address,
shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card or other payment
information, and other information, depending on the particular Client, website
or other application at issue. In all instances, Radial will not share, sell,
rent, or trade with third parties for promotional purposes any personal data
processed by Radial, unless Radial is directed to do so by a Client who owns
such personal data.
Clients,
Suppliers and Other Business Partners
Radial may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about employees and agents
of its Clients, suppliers and other business partners. Such data may include
contact information (e.g. names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and
email addresses); user IDs and passwords; information collected through
Internet-based and ecommerce activities; and other transaction-related data.
Radial may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including
to establish and maintain Client, supplier and other business relationships; to
deliver or provide products or services; to provide access to Internet-based
applications; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as
necessary or appropriate in connection with the establishment, servicing and
development of the business relationship.
Why We
Collect Information
We (including all members of our corporate family) may collect and use the
information collected at our Sites to contract you and provide you with the
information your requested, and to help us design and deliver better services
to our clients. For example, we may use this data to monitor our Sites and to
collect aggregate data for marketing purposes and for other future uses, or to
determine the most appropriate information to send to those who request it.
You may
choose voluntarily to give us personally identifiable information, such as your
name, address, phone number, email address, or other information about
yourself.  In addition, we may collect information automatically as you
navigate our sites. This information may include (but may not be limited to): general
location data, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our sites (e.g., HTML pages,
graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device
data such as mobile identifiers, carrier network information, the mobile
website or mobile app used, and cookie or pixel tag data.
Certain
forms on our sites may also request contact and profile information, such as
user name, email address, website, phone number, or company information.
Completion of these forms is entirely voluntary but may be required in order to
request certain services from Radial. Resume submissions on our Sites are used
to screen candidates and contact them for interviews.
Radial
may also use our sites to periodically survey our clients for purposes of
improving the quality of our service and customer satisfaction. Client
participation is completely voluntary, and any information we collect from you
as part of our surveys will be treated with the same respect as any other
information gathered in accordance with this Notice.
How We
Collect ItAs explained above we collect information through surveys, forms
on our websites and in our daily interactions with our clients and vendors. Please
note that we only obtain personal information that can be used to contact you,
such as your name, address, phone number or email address, if it is supplied to
use voluntarily.
Also, our Sites use web beacons and other technologies to collect information
when you access our websites, and we may store that information in “cookies”.
If you
have chosen to receive marketing messages from us about our products and
services, we may use information from our log files, cookies, or web beacons to
help us make those communications more useful or interesting to you. We may
periodically track the open-rates and click behavior of our emails and other
messages and advertisements to help us identify which portions of our
advertisements are most popular and effective with our customers.
How We
Use Cookies and Other Technologies
When you access our sites, we and our affiliates, business partners and vendors
may place small data files on your computer or other device. We use these data
files, commonly known as “Cookies” to help us identify you as a site visitor or
Client, customize our content and enhance your site experience. These third
parties may also use a technology called “Tags” or “Web Beacons”. Similar in
function to Cookies, Web Beacons allow us to understand the movements of
visitors to our Sites. The tracking technologies on our Sites do not collect
personal information that can be used to contact you, such as your name,
address, phone number or email address. We use this information to analyze
trends, to administer our Sites, to track users' movements around the Sites,
and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
However, please note that tracking technologies do collect identifiers that
could be considered personal information under certain regulations.

should note that although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies,
you may be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse
first party or third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is
being sent. However, disabling or limiting cookies may cause certain features
of this site to not function properly.  Check
your browser’s “Help” files or other similar resources to learn more about
handling cookies on your browser.Data
Supplementation
We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly
available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and
combine this data with information we already have about you.  This helps
us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and
provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Examples of the
types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or
purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have
about you may include address information about you from third party sources,
such as the U.S. Postal Service, to verify your address. This information is
used for payment processing, fraud prevention and fulfillment services.
Do Not
Track
California law requires us to state how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT)
signals. Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for
recognizing or honoring DNT, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. We
await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine
when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
