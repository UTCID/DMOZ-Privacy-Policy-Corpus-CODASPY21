Returns Policy
We make every effort to help you find the appropriate resources for your needs. However, if you find that a book does not meet your needs, it can be returned for a refund. To return books, you must contact Compassion Books, Inc. within 30 days of the date on your invoice. We will accept returns of books if received in undamaged, re-saleable condition. We do not refund shipping or tax unless the problem is our fault, such as shipping you the wrong book.
Returns received in damaged condition will be shipped back to you at your expense.
Please note that DVDs and CDs are not returnable. Please contact us before purchasing if you would like to preview a copy before your final purchase.
