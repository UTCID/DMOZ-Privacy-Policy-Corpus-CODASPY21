If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of those sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their own privacy statements.

In the past 12 months, we may have shared your personal information for the following business purposes:

Notice to residents of California
If you are a California resident, California law provides you with certain rights.
Please read
These rights may be limited or inapplicable by law if you are an employee of Alight.
If you are an employee of a client (i.e., your employer) receiving services from Alight, Alight receives your information solely for the purposes of completing a business purpose of our clients and does not use or disclosure your information except as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which we received your information. In these circumstances, Alight’s client remains primarily responsible for your information. As a result, we may re-direct a query about our use of your information to our client for response.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to opt out of the disclosure of your personal information by Alight to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to it. If this Statement were to change, you can opt-out of such disclosures by sending us an email privacy.info@alight.com or sending written request to Chief Privacy Officer, Alight Solutions LLC, 4 Overlook Point, Lincolnshire, IL 60069.
To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to privacy.info@alight.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal, even when requested.
Beginning on January 1, 2020, pursuant to California Civil Code 1798.100 et seq., the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have the following, additional rights:
Your Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability: You may request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information in the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your personal information request, we will disclose to you up to the limits permitted under applicable law:
The categories and specific pieces of personal information we collected about you;
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information;
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information; and
If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists identifying: (a) the categories of your personal information collected and sold, and the categories of the third parties to whom the data was sold; and (b) the categories of your personal information that was disclosed for business purposes.
Your Right to Request Deletion: You may request that we delete any of the personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. We may deny your request if the information that you are requesting we delete relates to your past, current or prospective employment with Alight, including but not limited to information necessary to administer Alight’s employee benefits programs.
We may also deny your request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with California Penal Code Section 1546 et seq. (the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act);
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Your Right to Opt-Out: We do not sell personal information to third parties. If that should change, subject to certain limitations, you will have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information.
Exercising Your CCPA Rights: To exercise any of the CCPA rights described above beginning on January 1, 2020, please submit a verifiable personal information request to us by either emailing us at privacy.info@alight.com or writing to us at the mailing address provided below.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may submit a personal information request. If you elect to use an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, Alight may require additional information from the authorized agent. At this time, the CCPA does not provide employees or representatives of our business partners with the right to make information requests.
You may only submit two personal information requests within a 12-month period. The verifiable personal information request must:
Either (a) be submitted via your account with one of our sites; or (b) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or an authorized representative; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Response Timing and Format: We endeavor to respond to a personal information request within 45 days of our receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. If provided electronically, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is in a portable and readily useable format. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your personal information request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Your Right to Non-Discrimination: Unless permitted or required by law, if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services;
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services, or a different level or quality of goods or services.
At this time, Alight does not offer any different rates for goods or services based on your decision to opt-out of certain information sharing. If that changes in the future, Alight will disclose the financial terms of the revised rates.

Notice to individuals located in the European Union
Alight processes personal information for the purposes described above. If we use personal information for purposes other than as described in this Statement, we will provide you with specific notice at the time of collection or before we use your data for such new purposes. In addition, we will respond to requests to fulfill your rights as data subjects in the European Union, as required under EU Regulation 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
Legal Basis for Processing Information: We process personal information only when we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis we will rely on will be one of the following:
You have consented to the processing of your personal information. You can withdraw your consent at any time;
The processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract);
The processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation that applies to Alight; or
The processing is necessary for purposes that are in Alight's legitimate interests, such as protecting the security of our Sites and Services, conducting market research to improve our products and Services, improving the functioning of our Sites, and providing you with promotional material about our products and Services, provided always that such processing is fair, and balanced and that our processing does not unduly impact your rights.
Your Choice to Provide Information: You can choose not to provide personal information to Alight by refraining from, among other things, using our Services and requesting information. You also may refrain from submitting information directly to us. However, if you do not provide personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide you with the full range of our products and Services, or with information about our products, Services, promotions and other opportunities.
Your Rights: You generally have certain rights regarding the personal information that we maintain about you, which in certain circumstances, you will be able to exercise. These rights are as follows:
You may request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you. If we maintain your personal information based on your consent or so that we could enter into a contract with you, you can also request that we provide you a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine­ readable format.
If your personal information is incorrect, you may request that we correct, amend or delete personal information that is inaccurate or incomplete.
You may request that we erase or restrict the processing of your personal information if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage.
When our legal basis for processing your information is your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
You may object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances when we (i) process your information for the purposes of our legitimate interests, (ii) use your personal information for direct marketing; or (iii) use your personal information for statistical purposes.
Individuals who desire to make an individual rights request in accordance with the GDPR are directed to make such a request via Alight's privacy mailbox at privacy.info@alight.com. Such requests will first need to be verified by 'reasonable means' and an individual will be asked to specify the information the request relates to. Subject to applicable law, we will comply with your request as soon as practicable, and in any event, within one month after receiving a valid request. If your request is particularly complicated, we may have to extend this period to 2 months. Access and correction may be done for free, unless requests are repetitive, excessive or unfounded, in which case we may charge you the administrative costs we have incurred handling the request.
Complaints: If you are unhappy or have concerns about the way in which we have handled your information, please contact us (see “Contact Us”) so that we can try to resolve the issue. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the EU.
