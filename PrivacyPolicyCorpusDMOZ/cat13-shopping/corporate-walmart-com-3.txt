You can ask us to delete your personal information. 3. You can ask that we stop selling your personal information. More information on each of these requests is below. 1. What personal information do you collect about me? If you make this request, we will return to you (to the extent required by law): The categories of personal information we have collected about you.

Once we receive a request, we will delete the personal information (to the extent required by law) we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same.

3. Stop Selling My Personal Information: We do not share your personal information for money. We do share personal information within our Walmart family of companies and with certain third parties, which may be considered a “sale” under California law even if we don’t receive money in exchange for the information.

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. If you are a California resident, you have a right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
