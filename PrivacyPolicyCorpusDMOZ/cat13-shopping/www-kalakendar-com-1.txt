Shipping, Payment, and Return Policy
RETURN POLICY
We want you to love your purchase! If you're not completely satisfied let us know and we will work with you to make it right. Please note: due to the handmade nature of our instruments there may be slight variations and imperfections in some items. We strongly believe this is one of the beautiful things about owning a handmade instrument. We are probably the only Instrument Dealer that will offer our Customers, Complete Satisfaction or we will refund your instrument purchase. Shipping, packaging/handling charges are not refundable.
Exchange + Returns Information
We allow a three-day (from the time you receive the goods) grace period on most items. We will consider an item sold (non-returnable) if we are not notified by email or telephone within 3 days of delivery of goods (no exceptions).
To exchange/return an item please call or email for a Return Authorization.  Any item returned to us without our authorization may be refused. Return items should be properly packed, insured and shipped prepaid.  Due to certain reasons, we can not exchange or give refunds on books, software, drum heads or any flute/reed instruments (health regulations). Instruments that have been custom ordered (special tuning ie. A-432 Hz natural tuning) are also consider final sale.  If the exchange/return is due to our error, we will send out a return shipping label for the item (Canada only).  Customers are responsible for shipping, both ways; in the event of a free shipping promotion, and the goods are exchanged/returned, the customer will be responsible for the actual outbound shipping charges.  All returned items must be in new original condition, any damages of any kind, the customer will be responsible for, and deducted from your return.  Effective December 1, 2020 All returns are subject to a 5% restocking fee.   All international customers (goods shipped outside of Canada) are subject to a USD $35.00 customs brokerage fee on returned/exchanged merchandise.  This customs brokerage fee does not apply to Canadian residents.
Please note as a formality, when placing your order and checking the box you are agreeing to these terms via electronic signature.
We are trying to offer our customers a hassle free exchange/return policy.
Pre-Orders
Instruments which are offered as Pre-Orders, Currently in Production are generally offered at a discounted price. You will be billed on your credit card with the understanding that your order will be processed next in line once the instrument arrives, usually a expected shipping date is given under availability and also stated on your e-invoice emailed to you.  Customers who cancel prior to the expected shipping date stated on the e-invoice are subject to a 10% cancellation fee. We understand in a perfect world everything would go according to plan, unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world. In the event the we are delayed with completing your order due to unforeseen circumstances (manufacturing or shipping lines),  the customer will have the option to either remain with the current pre-order or cancel without penalty.

All of our instruments are shipped from our Canada location. As always the instruments are double-checked prior to shipping by us and expertly packaged in strong corrugated boxes with plenty of foam fill.  We do not 'drop-ship' or ship directly to the customer from India, it might be cheaper, but there is never usually any assurance that the instrument is tweaked fully/properly.  This makes a Huge difference!
For our Customers outside of Canada/USA, we suggest you select FedEx/UPS for large value items and Canada Post for smaller items.

A Word about Indian Instruments (Blemishes & Marring)
Majority of Indian instruments are made exclusively by hand, using minimal tools and as with all folk instruments, there will be slight variations. Their may be blemishes (wood fractures, scuffs, denting, etc.) which are so minor that they will not be notice for a while, these are cosmetic flaws, which will have no adverse effects on the tonal quality (we have already put these instruments through a rigorous inspection process). Finishes are made using shellac and so are highly sensitive to heat and impressions, our policy on damage does not apply to minor finish problems.  An Indian instrument rarely leaves the hands of his maker without a slight blemish or 'birth mark'.   If this is an issue for you, please consider this before ordering!
All the instruments have been photographed in natural light, with some minor color corrections for better viewing
