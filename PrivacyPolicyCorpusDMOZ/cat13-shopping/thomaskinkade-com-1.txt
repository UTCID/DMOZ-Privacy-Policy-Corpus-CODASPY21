Order Terms & Shipping Policy
Thank you for taking the time to review our ThomasKinkade.com order terms and shipping policy. It is always our goal to provide quick and quality service to all of our customers. However we ask our customers to understand that most of our items are printed, stretched, highlighted and/or framed to order. We don’t often rush our process as we want to maintain our unusually high quality standards. We primarily ship to U.S. addresses, but are more than happy to service our customers in other countries. If you are asking us to ship outside of the U.S. please take note of our International Shipping Policy below.
