Privacy Policy
BTF understands your concerns about how your private information you have supplied and we gathered is used and shared. BTF respects your privacy and appreciates your trust in our company in this issue. This notice describes our privacy policy and how your private information is protected and used.
Information Collection: We collect information on a voluntary basis from customers and visitors to our site, when they choose to register or place an order with us. To ensure easy shopping and timely product delivery we ask for information including your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information (for your protection we only display the last four digits of your credit card). All of these are necessary for purchase and quick communication with you about the status of your order. Should you wish to change your information, simply click on My Account link located on the top of the Home Page. In addition, bestturkishfood.com will collect information including Browser Type, IP address, and server information from consumers who write to us about technical problems. In addition, we collect aggregate information on pages visited, and information volunteered by consumers, such as survey information and/or site registrations.
Information Use: Persons and customers who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online to ensure quality service. People who register and specify that they wish to receive telephone calls in regards to new products and services or upcoming events, or in connection with surveys conducted by us or on our behalf may receive calls from time to time.
The information we collect is only used to (1) improve the content of our web site, customer service, and provide technical support (2) customize the content and/or layout of our page for individual consumers, and (3) contact consumers about updates to our web site and for marketing purposes, such as improving BTF services or alerting customers of special offers and events. This information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. This means we will not distribute, sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party. If you are registered, you may remove your name from our lists by updating your account information. You will be prompted with a choice upon registering with BTF.
Sharing of Information: Bestturkishfood.com DOES NOT SHARE OR SELL ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION other than situations stated below:
Credit Card transactions:When using a credit card to make a payment, BTF is required to provide certain information to the credit card processing gateway. The information we provide is required to authorize the credit card transaction and will be solely used to complete the order. The information we submit is your name, last name, street address, zip code, city, country, e-mail address, order amount, credit card number and expiration date of credit card.
Legal Requirements:Legal authorities may request your personal information in rare cases. Under those circumstances BTF may provide requested information to legal authorities as defined by law.
