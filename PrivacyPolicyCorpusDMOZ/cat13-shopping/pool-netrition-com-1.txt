SALES TAX
On June 21, 2018 the United States Supreme Court ruled on the South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 585 U.S. (2018) case. The court ruled that states may charge tax on purchases made from out-of-state sellers, even if the seller does not have a physical presence in the taxing state.
Since the ruling, states have begun passing laws to collect sales tax on internet purchases. To date, we are required to collect and pay sales tax, for products that are deemed taxable, for orders shipping to the following states:
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.
We expect additional states to pass legislation. If we meet the requirements, we will begin collecting sales tax for those states as well.
International customers may be subjected to taxes payable to your own country upon receiving the package, but we do not collect nor know what the amount of these taxes are. Check with your country's tax authority.
DAMAGES AND SHORTAGES
Merchandise damaged during shipping or shortages (missing items) must be reported to Netrition within 24 hours of receipt. Netrition will then either issue you credit or send replacements for the amount of any
confirmed damaged or missing merchandise. Netrition will contact the shipping company for visual inspection of the merchandise and box. Netrition will then either issue you credit or send replacements for the amount of any confirmed damaged or missing merchandise.
BACK ORDERS
We regularly stock every item we carry. Although every attempt is made to maintain inventory of each product we carry, occasionally we may run out of certain products. In this case, we will mark the product "out of stock"
on our website. If any product is not in stock for an order, we will hold off shipment of your entire order until all products are available. You should place a separate order containing only in-stock products to have it processed immediately.
LEGAL NOTICES
Any litigation, dispute, or other claim which may arise from the purchase, sale, advice, use or involvement with Netrition shall be settled in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and particularly the State of New York and shall be heard and venued in the County of Albany.
These policies are subject to change at any time without notice.
