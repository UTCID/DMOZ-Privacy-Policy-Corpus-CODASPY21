Privacy policy
Mark Sunderland Photography is a private business based in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England.
Your privacy is important to us.  This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, how long we keep it and your rights relating to our use of your data - please take a moment to review this information.
What data we collect from you and why
We collect personal data such as name, postal address, email address and so on for the purpose of fulfilling your specific request made via this website e.g. creating an account, placing an order, making an enquiry or subscribing to a mailing list.
We take all reasonable precautions to keep your data secure.  This website uses the PhotoDeck service - please see the PhotoDeck privacy policy for specific information relating to this service including data security.
We will not share your data with anyone without your permission unless compelled to do so by law or where it is necessary for specific information to be shared in order to fulfil your request - for example, if you order a fine art print from us we'll need to pass on your name and delivery address to our print partner, One Vision Imaging.
Note that we do not store your credit card details - these details are only collected by our payment processor, PayPal.
If you licence one of our images we'll also keep details of the image usage in our local licensing database which may contain basic contact details such as name and email address.
How long we keep your data
We will retain your data on the PhotoDeck platform for as long as we use the PhotoDeck service, so that you can have access to your order history, any lightboxes you have created and so on.
We will retain certain financial information such as invoices as hard copies for as long as required under statutory regulations.
We need to keep details of image usages in our local licensing database indefinitely in order to manage image rights, but any personal data associated with the usage can be removed once the licence period is over if you wish.
Access to your information and correction
You may request access to the data we hold about you.  If you would like a copy of your data then please get in touch using the Contacting us details below.
We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate.  You may ask us to correct information you think is inaccurate or you may ask us to delete your data.
