Typographical Errors
In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information received from our suppliers, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.
Product Imagery
Product images displayed on 2bigfeet.com may differ slightly from the product you receive. Due to the nature of natural, tanned leather no two pair of shoes will be identical. Also, slight changes in the outsole or material may be made after photos are taken.
Shipping Quotes
Shipping quotes are displayed on www.2BigFeet.com in the shopping cart once you add your products to the cart, choose your Country, enter your postal code, and click 'recalculate.' These quotes are estimations and may change once the order is packed in the warehouse. Shipping costs are based on weight of the total package as well as package dimensions. If actual shipping costs differ from the quote provided an email will be sent providing the customer with the new shipping cost. We may at times need to alter your shipping method based on the amount you paid for shipping or the warehouse that is shipping your order. Not all warehouses ship Internationally or offer shipping through the United States Postal Service.

Severability
Any provision of any relevant terms and conditions, policies and notices, which is or becomes unenforceable in any jurisdiction, whether due to being void, invalidity, illegality, unlawfulness or for any reason whatever, shall, in such jurisdiction only and only to the extent that it is so unenforceable, be treated as void and the remaining provisions of any relevant terms and conditions, policies and notices shall remain in full force and effect.

Packages in Transit
2BigFeet, LLC and its owners shall not be held responsible for packages once they have left their warehouse doors. Customers shall contact the appropriate mail/parcel courier in regards to delivery. If customer desires insurance or signature requirements for packages they shall contact 2BigFeet, LLC at the time of order placement to add the desired options. 2BigFeet, LLC has no control over parcel couriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx) and therefore we cannot control their delivery times. All delivery estimates provided by 2BigFeet,LLC are only estimates as provided from each parcel courier. Therefore, 2BigFeet, LLC is not responsible for delivery delays.
International Orders
2BigFeet, LLC ships to most major countries. A country's Customs department may levi additional fees, tarifs, or taxes on your order. You, the customer, are responsible for checking with your country's Customs department to inquire about any potential fees for receiving International parcels from the United States. For Canadian customers, UPS also charges brokerage fees to import into Canada. If you choose UPS delivery for your order then these fees will be due by you to UPS upon delivery. UPS brokerage fees are not included in shipping costs collected by 2BigFeet, LLC. Our current shopping cart system may mis-quote shipping if you purchase more than one item. In this instance we may upgrade your shipping to a more expedient option. If you were under-quoted then we will contact you via email.
