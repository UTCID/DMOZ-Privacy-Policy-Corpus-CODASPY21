Back Orders
If upon processing your order, the manufacturer tells us it is backordered, we will email you. You may decide to wait for the backordered item to come back into stock, order another item, or cancel your order for an immediate refund.
How to Ensure Proper Fit and Avoid Returns
Every manufacturer has different sizing. Your pooch may wear a small in one manufacturer, but may wear a medium in another.
Measure your dog's chest prior to ordering to avoid returns!
Measure your dog around the chest.
Match the measurement on the size chart for the item you want.
Go up one size if your dog is at the top of the size range.
Do not go by the weight of your dog! Dogs of the same weight have different measurements. For example, a 12-pound poodle and a 12-pound Bichon have different chest measurements.
If you need assistance. Please contact us at 561.495.9971, and we will be happy to help you determine the best size for your pup.

Check items for fit immediately upon receipt. You have 15 days after delivery to return an ill-fitting item.
