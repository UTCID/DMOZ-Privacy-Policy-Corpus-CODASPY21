The Fragrance Shop and our designees also shall have the right (but no obligation) to use the name that you submit, as well as any other name by which you are or may be known, in connection with User-Generated Content. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you hereby unconditionally grant to The Fragrance Shop a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable universal license to use, re-use, publish, display, distribute, copy, store, edit, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise use your User-Generated Content, in whole or in part, by all means and in all media now known or hereafter devised, including but not limited to The Fragrance Shop catalogs, websites, apps, catalogs, email, social media channels, advertising media, store materials, credit card marketing, and in other marketing opportunities for any and all purposes without further notice to you and with or without attribution (the “User-Generated Content License“).

Your submission of Content shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of North Carolina, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law provisions. Except for disputes for which only injunctive relief is sought, any disputes relating to these Terms of Use (which are not otherwise resolved by the parties) will be submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS in Carrboro, North Carolina in accordance with the then prevailing JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction. In the event any disagreement relating to these Terms and Conditions results in litigation, you agree that jurisdiction over and venue in any such legal proceeding shall be solely in the state or federal courts located in North Carolina, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Each party waives its right to a trial by jury for any disputes between the parties. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to your Content must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or be barred forever. The Fragrance Shop’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and The Fragrance Shop with regard to your Content. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these Terms of Use. The Fragrance Shop may assign its rights and duties under these Terms and Conditions to any party at any time without notice to you.

The designer type fragrances available here are not the Designer originals, they are our own replications in concentrated form, completely free of alcohol and other harmful fillers.
Our designer types accurately replicate the scent, but are not the original product.
All of our fragrances are created in-house, or expressly for us by a select group of boutique perfumers.
