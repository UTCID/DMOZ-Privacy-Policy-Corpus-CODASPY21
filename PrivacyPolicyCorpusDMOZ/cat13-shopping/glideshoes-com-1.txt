What kinds of personal information does Glide Shoes collect?
In general, you can visit Glide Shoes on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. We ask for information from you in several ways from different parts of our Web site.
· We ask for personal information from you when you become a registered user of Glide Shoes Web site. You are required to register and receive a logon name to be able to access and use certain features of Glide Shoes Web site and to buy products or services. At that time, Glide Shoes asks for certain required information such as your name, e-mail address, and other information to process and fulfill your order. We also request certain other optional information that will enable us to provide you with a more personalized experience when using Glide Shoes Web site. We will let you know what information is optional, and you decide whether or not you want to provide that information or to receive newsletters or third party correspondence.

Glide Shoes will comply with this privacy policy and may use your personal information in the same manner it is used by Glide Shoes. If a company other than Glide Shoes is gathering or maintaining your personal data from our Web site, you will be told before it is collected or transferred. You can always choose not to share the information.
When companies other than Glide Shoes sponsor promotions, data collected on the Glide Shoes Web site in connection with these promotions may be shared with the sponsor. Once again, if this is the case, you will be notified before the data is collected or transferred, and you can decide not to participate. Most of these promotions are limited to United States or North American residents.

Does Glide Shoes share my information?
Other than as stated in this policy, Glide Shoes does not disclose any of your personal information to third parties without your permission. Read the following sections to learn more.
Business partners and sponsors
Glide Shoes may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but you will be notified beforehand and will be able to choose not to share your information. Many promotions give you the chance to request additional information from the sponsors. When you ask for more information, you give Glide Shoes permission to send your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. Much of the time, only your e-mail address will be shared. You will be notified if more information will be shared, and you can choose not to share the information.
Glide Shoes shopping
When you buy services or products offered through Glide Shoes, the provider of the product or service receives only the information required for the transaction to take place, unless additional information is collected by the product or service provider. You may be required to give these providers certain additional information to purchase some products or services. These providers have separate privacy and data collection practices. Glide Shoes has no responsibility or liability for their policies. The service provider’s home page usually provides a link to its privacy policy.
Third-party data and aggregate data
Glide Shoes discloses aggregated or anonymous statistics (for example, the percentage of users from the western U.S.) to prospective partners and advertisers and for other lawful purposes.
Other situations
Glide Shoes also may disclose your information where disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property rights, the users’ rights, or others’ rights. In the same way, Glide Shoes will disclose information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law or to comply with a legal process served on Glide Shoes or its Web site. We may disclose your personal information in the good faith belief that we must act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Glide Shoes, its Web site, or the public.

When you participate in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive promotion-related e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that some promotions offer.

· Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

What are cookies and how does Glide Shoes use them?
Part of our customized service involves using “cookies” so that we can immediately recognize you, determine when you – or someone using the same browser you previously used – revisits Glide Shoes, and to provide a more personalized experience. A “cookie” is a chunk of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept cookies before you can log-in or customize. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. Glide Shoes does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. This policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers on our Web site.
Glide Shoes uses cookies to:
1. Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web site so that you can access your account information. When you log in, the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified.
2. Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses Glide Shoes Web site is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target our advertisements.
3. Help Glide Shoes partners track visits and complete business transactions. This information is sometimes called “click stream” or “click trail.”
4. Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a Glide Shoes-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the user’s progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings).
5. Measure the traffic to various areas of the Glide Shoes Web site. We measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We may use this information to personalize the information and design in our Web site.
What about the privacy of children?
Glide Shoes is a general audience Web site and does not request the age of its customers. If a child wants to log in or register at our site, we prefer that a parent or guardian do so instead of the child. In this way, we have a parent or guardian’s consent before we gather any information from the user.
