Shipping (Continental U.S.)
Orders are ship via UPS Ground to addresses within the continental US only.  Orders that are valued over $500 may require a signature upon delivery.  We will only ship to the billing address of the credit card being used to pay for the order.  If you need your order to be expedited you can call us at (708)448-8260 to request faster shipping.  Additional charges will apply for expedited shipping.  Orders containing in-stock items will ship within two business day after being placed.  Additional time may be needed for items that are not in stock.  You will be notified if items on your order are not in stock.  A tracking number will be sent to the email address you include with your order after it has shipped.  The email is sent from the shipping company used and we are not notified of bounced messages.  If you do not receive your tracking number please feel free to email us at mtb@rbikes.com or call us at (708)448-8260.Please note that some items may be subject to additional shipping and handling charges because of size or weight.APO/FPO shipping: We appreciate the opportunity to support our overseas service members and their families and will gladly ship to an APO/FPO address. Please expect at least 7 to 14 additional days for the order to arrive and remember that circumstances beyond our control can possibly cause longer delays. If a package is lost, a claim cannot be filed until 45 days after the item has been shipped per the post office procedures.  In addition, we can not ship complete bikes to APO/FPO addresses due to size restrictions given by the post office.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
In-Store Pickup
You must call us to arrange pick-up of an item. In-stock items on orders requesting in-store pickup will usually be ready within one business day. Please call us Monday - Friday between 10-5pm at (708)448-8260 to arrange pick-up.
Shipping (International)
International shipping is available on select brands.  Call +1 (708) 448-8260 for more details or to place an order.  Please know that although we do offer International shipping on some items we do not have the capability to process International credit cards. If you wish to place an order that will not use a US credit card for payment then you must pay with a bank wire transfer.  Please call +1 (708) 448-8260 for details.
Backorders
Some items on our website are non-stocked items. Usually these items are available to ship within 1-5 business days. Occasionally an item will take longer to ship. If this should occur, we will contact you within 1-2 business days to advise you of availability and when you can expect your item(s) to ship. If we cannot ship every item on your order within 5 business days of submitting it, we will back order the remaining items and you will not be charged for additional shipping.
Returns
If you wish to return an item purchased from us, you can either bring it to our store with your receipt or call us for an RA# and instructions to ship it back to us*. Ship returns via Ground UPS or insured US Mail (we do not accept CODs). We will refund shipping costs on damaged or incorrect merchandise only. Merchandise returned that appears used will not be accepted. (Labor fees are not refundable, i.e., labor to build a custom wheelseet.)  Returns must have a return authorization number clearly marked on the outside of the package or the item will be refused. A return authorization number can be obtained by calling 708 448 8260 or e-mailing mtb@rbikes.com.
When returning an item to us, please make sure that it packaged securely before shipping.  We are not responsible for damage incurred to an item during return shipping.  We recommend that you purchase insurance when returning an item to us.
General Restocking Fee's - Please note that a 15% restocking fee applies to orders returned unless the item is defective or damaged before receipt, you received the wrong item, or the fee is prohibited by law.  Restocking fee's only apply to the price of the item itself.  S&H is non-refundable unless the item is damaged or incorrect.  Our 15% restocking fee does not apply to custom bikes, custom wheels or other custom made merchandise.  Please see our custom merchandise return policy below for more details if you're looking to return a custom made product.
* We do not accept returns on Special Order Bikes.
Custom Merchandise Return / Exchange Policy & Restocking Fee's - Because custom made products such as custom bikes, custom wheelsets & custom wheels are custom designed & built to your specifications, and because custom bikes, wheels & other custom merchandise require a rather lengthy amount of time to assemble, we charge a 35% restocking fee for all custom product returns unless the item is damaged or incorrect.  Please note that "color variation" on custom wheels & bikes does not qualify as an "incorrect item", as paint color & anodized products all have some level of color variation which neither we, nor the manufacturuer, has complte control over.  We, as well as our manufacturuers, do our best to build custom products as true the advertised color shown on our website and our manfacturers websites as possible; however there is always some level of color variation which is beyond our control.  S&H will not be refunded for custom product returns unless it is defective or incorrect.  Furthermore, if you choose to return a non-defective custom wheel, wheelset or bike, the 65% credit will only be applied as a store credit towards further purchases with rbikes.com
