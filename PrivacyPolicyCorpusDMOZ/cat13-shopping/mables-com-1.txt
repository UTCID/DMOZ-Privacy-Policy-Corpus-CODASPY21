Privacy Policy No Spam
Mables.com maintains a strict NO SPAM policy. Your e-mail address will not be sold or provided in any manner to a third party if you e-mail us, leave us a comment in our blog, or otherwise provide us with your contact information. That’s just bad karma. We wouldn’t do that to you.
Cookies
Mmm, cookies. Wait, not that kind! Some pages on Mables.com use another, sadly inedible, kind of “cookies”. These far nerdier cookies are tiny text files (.txt) that contains a string of numbers and letters. There are two types of cookies that are used at Mables.com: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the “Cookies” folder on your computer and remains in this “Cookies” folder after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer’s memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer.
Why use cookies? They enable all kinds of useful, non-invasive, methods of enhancing your experience online. From the “remember me” feature found in the blog comments, to helping us understand which pages our visitors like the most, it’s all done via the magic of cookies.
