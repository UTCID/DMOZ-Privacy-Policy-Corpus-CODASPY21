Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy is very simple:
We don't share any information we get from you with anyone, at anytime.
We don't sell it or give it away.
If you pay us through an external credit card processor, such as ProPay,
we do not recieve any credit card information about you, from them,
other than whether or not your shipping address
matches your billing address, which is for our own security purposes.
If you order with a credit card directly through us,
that information is never stored on a computer.
When the order has been fulfilled, the credit card info is physically destroyed.
We keep no copy of it, either electronically, or in any other form.
Furthermore, we don't 'track' your movements through our website, other than
with a program called 'Google Analytics', which tells us how many people are
looking at our website during a particular time of day, etc.
If you want to block this, you can go into the 'Options' or 'Preferences'
section of your web browser and instruct it to block all such activity.
Disclaimer:
We make no claims for the vendors whose advertising we
post on this web site. They have no connection with us
other than that of advertiser to publisher. If you have
concerns or problems with any of these advertisers, we
would advise you to contact them directly.
If you have any comments or question for us, please feel free
