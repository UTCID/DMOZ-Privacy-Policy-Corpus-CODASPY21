IX. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL LENOX (INCLUDING ANY OF ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNEES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BAZAARVOICE, INC.) BE LIABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING ANY OF YOUR PARTNERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SUCCESSORS, HEIRS OR ASSIGNEES) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, EQUITY, NEGLIGENCE, INTENDED CONDUCT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, AND STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE CONTENT OF THE WEBSITE, FOR YOUR ACTION OR INACTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE, FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR DATA, ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR ECONOMIC LOSS YOU MAY INCUR ENSUING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH (A) THE WEBSITE; OR (B) YOUR SUBMISSION OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION THROUGH THE WEBSITE, EVEN IF LENOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
DESPITE THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, IF A TRIBUNAL OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION DECIDES TO AWARD MONETARY DAMAGES TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM THE SAME, THE AMOUNT OF MONETARY DAMAGES FOR SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF $100.
THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN OUR TERMS, IN SUCH CASES, THE LIABILITY OF LENOX WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
X. Indemnification
You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lenox, including its partners, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees, contractors, successors, or assignees and third-party service providers from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the website; (b) your breach of this Agreement; or (c) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully as required by us in the defense or settlement of any claim. We will provide you with timely notice of any such claim, suit or proceeding.
XI. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver and Jury Waiver
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
Waiver of Jury Trial
LENOX AND YOU EACH AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY FOR ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR INFRINGEMENT OF YOUR OR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (SUCH AS COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, DOMAINS, LOGOS, TRADE DRESS, TRADE SECRETS, AND PATENTS).Such disputes include those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration, which is typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. Lenox and you agree not to combine a dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Agreement with a dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under this Agreement.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth herein.
Required Use of AAA
You agree that the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Opt-Out Procedure
You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms and Conditions of Use; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:
Lenox CorporationP.O. Box 735Bristol, PA 19007-0806
You must include: (1) your name and residence address; (2) the mobile phone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our agreement to arbitrate.
Place to File Permitted Court Actions
If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your dispute is related to intellectual property rights, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you and Lenox agree and consent that such disputes will be resolved in the federal or state courts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that agree to submit to personal jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania or Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.
Time Limit to Start Arbitration
We and you agree that for any dispute (except intellectual property disputes) must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the dispute first arose; otherwise, such dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the dispute first arose, the arbitration will be dismissed as untimely.
Arbitration Agreement Survival
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Lenox.
XII. Availability & Termination Of Lenox
The website may be interrupted, including for maintenance, repairs, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We may discontinue some or all of our services at any time and events beyond our control may affect our services.
We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of the website anytime for any reason, such as if you violate our Agreement or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for us, our users, or others.
XIII. General Modifications
At any time and at Lenox’s sole discretion, we may add, delete, or modify this Agreement or the website. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Agreement, as appropriate by amending the “Last Modified” date at the top of this Agreement. Your continued use of Lenox confirms your acceptance of our Agreement, as amended. If you do not agree to our Agreement, as amended, you must stop using the website. Please review our Agreement from time to time. All changes to the Agreement shall be effective immediately.
Miscellaneous
This Agreement, which includes our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published on the website, constitute the entire agreement between you and us. If any part of this Agreement are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.
Our failure or delay to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this agreement. We may assign our rights and duties under this agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.
All of our rights and obligations under our Agreement are freely assignable by us to any of our affiliates or in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your information to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under our Agreement to anyone else without our prior written consent.
Contacting Us
If you have any questions about this Agreement, please contact us at:
Lenox CorporationP.O. Box 735 Bristol, PA 19007-0806info@lenox.com
Although Lenox will in most circumstances be able to receive your e-mail or other information provided, Lenox does not guarantee that it will receive all such e-mail or other information timely and accurately and shall not be legally obligated to read, act on or respond to any such e-mail or other information.
Secure Shopping
Safe Shopping Guarantee
We guarantee that every Lenox.com transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at Lenox.com. Under the U.S. Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
Secure Shopping
Lenox.com utilizes firewalls and the latest network security to safeguard your information throughout the transaction.
Protection Of Information Being Transmitted
Another line of defense is our use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption, the industry standard and best available secure transaction technology. This technology lets you select "secured" or "unsecured" shopping. If your browser is capable of SSL, you should use the "secured" option, which means all sensitive information will be encrypted before being sent over the Internet.
Your transactions are secure from unauthorized access (SSL is supported by Netscape 2.0+, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0+, and most frames-enabled browsers). When you begin a transaction, the rest of your visit will take place on our secure server. Every secure page on our website has been secured with a digital certificate by VeriSign, Inc. This is shown via the "site certificate" that is resident on all secure pages.
Password Protection Of Your Personal Information
A password system has been established to ensure that only you can access your personal information stored in your free Lenox.com account. We strongly suggest that you use a minimum password length of 4-6 characters.
How Can I Tell If A Site Is Safe?
You can configure Internet Explorer or Netscape browsers to alert you to secured pages or sites. Microsoft Internet Explorer displays a security icon in your browser's status bar. To view the certificate, double click on the icon.
Netscape Navigator
Displays an icon or https:// in your browser's address field to indicate a secure connection. To view the certificate, double click on the icon in your browser's status bar.
If I Prefer Not To Buy Online, Can I Still Buy Products Sold On Lenox.com?
Yes! While we've installed the latest security and firewall protection for online shoppers, we understand the need for other payment options. You can order by telephone, mail or fax. When you order, please specify the following:
Specify this is an Internet order.
List the items, the quantities and each item number you wish to purchase.
Specify your billing address, including apartment number, street address, city, state and zip code.
If your shipping address is different from your billing address, we need to know the apartment number, street address, city, state and zip code.
Specify your email address and telephone number.
You can order via telephone by calling Customer Service at 1-800-223-4311, Mon-Fri 8:30 a.m. – 11 p.m. ET, Sat 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. ET, Sun 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. ET. Or mail your order to Lenox Customer Service Lenox P.O. Box 735, Bristol, PA 19007-0735 Orders also may be faxed to (267) 525-5649
Note that whether you place your Lenox.com order online, or via mail, fax or phone, you must pay in full before your order can be shipped.

A cookie is a text file saved to your computer's hard drive. The text file contains small pieces of data sent by a web server and stored on your computer when you visit certain websites. Your browser can "read" this information when you visit the site again. A cookie cannot access your computer files or hard drive.
Does Lenox "Cookie"?
Yes, you will receive a "cookie" when you enter our site. This cookie allows the site's features to run smoothly. This small piece of text (a few bytes) is stored on your computer. The cookie does not reveal your identity or email address or harm your computer. If you choose to register this information later, that's your choice. The cookie is used to restore session information. The only information contained in the cookie is your session ID; no personally identifiable information is stored nor transmitted in the cookie.
What Is The Trustwave Seal?
This symbol lets you know that your shopping is safe. The Trustwave Seal was voted the #1 Sign of Trust on the Internet. This seal verifies that Lenox.com is using state-of-the-art SSL encryption to protect your transactions. This protects confidential information - such as credit card numbers, online forms, and other data - from interception and hacking. Trustwave Secure Server IDs provide the strongest security available today. To verify that our Trustwave certification is current, simply click on the Trustwave logo.
What Mechanisms Are Used To Protect Stored Information?
Lenox takes many measures to protect the confidentiality and security of your information while it is stored, including:
Housing internal computer systems in a highly secure building to provide additional protection against unauthorized access and changes to stored information.
Storing credit card information on a server not accessible via the Internet.
Accessibility
We are committed to ensuring that individuals with disabilities can access all of our goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations.

California Supply Chain Disclosure
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure Statement
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (“Act”) became effective January 1, 2012 in the State of California. The Act requires that certain companies doing business in California disclose their efforts to eliminate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. Lenox Corporation (“Lenox”) fully supports California’s efforts to protect human rights and enforce ethical labor practices.
Lenox has programs to effectively manage the risks of slavery and trafficking in our supply chain.
Our Sourcing Code of Conduct (the “Supplier Code”) addresses business practices of our third-party suppliers. The Supplier Code, which must be agreed to and signed by each supplier before any Lenox purchase order can be processed, contains specific provisions prohibiting the use of child labor and forced or involuntary labor.
In addition to self-certification of compliance by each supplier, Lenox sourcing personnel are required to monitor supplier compliance.
Our purchase order agreements also contain representations that our suppliers are in compliance with all applicable federal, state and/or provincial, regional, municipal, and local laws, codes, regulations, rules, ordinances, decrees, permits, registrations and orders.
Moreover, Lenox may conduct, either on its own or through independent third-parties, unannounced visits and/or audits to ensure compliance with the Supplier Code.
The Lenox Compliance Hotline, available to all employees, directors and contractors, enables the reporting of any noncompliance by Lenox suppliers, their employees or subcontractors. Lenox employees who do not act promptly to report noncompliance matters may be subject to disciplinary action.
