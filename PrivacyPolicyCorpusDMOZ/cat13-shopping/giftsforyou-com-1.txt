Fair Information Practices
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
personal information.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We also agree to the individual redress principle, which
requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights
against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against
data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government
agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
