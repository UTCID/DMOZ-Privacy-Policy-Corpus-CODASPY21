Last Modified:  July 15th 2020
Welcome to the Parodi Holdings LLC DBA Avanti Cigar Company website terms and conditions of use (these “terms”). These terms are in place to govern your access to and use of our website located at https://www.avanticigar.com/ (which we refer to in this privacy policy as the “site”, which includes all content, functionality, and services offered on or through the site). These terms apply to all users of the site, including browsers, registered users, and customers.
The Avanti Cigar Company site is owned and operated by Parodi Holdings LLC DBA Avanti Cigar Company. When we refer to “you” and “your” in these terms, we are referring to you as a user of the site. “We,” “us,” “our” refer to Parodi Holdings LLC DBA Avanti Cigar Company, together with our affiliates. The term “content” refers to any information presented on the site, and includes text, data, graphics, images, photographs, video, audio, and any other presentation of information.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
These terms contain obligations you are expected to comply with and affect your legal rights. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS. By using the site in any way, including browsing, creating an account, signing up for our rewards program, placing an order, and/or using any interactive site tools, you are creating a binding contract between you and us, and you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms or to any other policy posted on the site, you should not access or otherwise use the site.
We may make changes to the site or these terms at any time.  Any modifications will be effective when the changes are posted to the site. It is your responsibility to check the site for updates to these terms. You will be able to determine when these terms were last updated by referring to the “Last Modified” legend at the top. By using the site after we post any changes to these terms, you agree to accept those changes, whether or not you have reviewed them.
CREATING AN ACCOUNT AND PROVIDING PURCHASE INFORMATION
When you use certain features of the site, you may be asked or required to create an account. Creating an account will require you to create a unique user identifier (your “User ID”) and a password. User IDs may not violate any third party rights, and may not be offensive. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to reject the use of any User ID or password, for any reason.
When you create an account, sign up to receive our newsletter, sign up for our rewards program, or make a purchase as a guest, and each time you log in to an account tied to your User ID, you represent, warrant, and agree that: (a) you are at least 21 years old, (b) you are using your actual identity, (c) you have provided only true, accurate, current and complete information to us, and (d) you will maintain and promptly update the information that you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.
Your User ID and password are unique to you, and you agree not to disclose or share your User ID or password to or with any third party. You further agree that you will be solely responsible for the maintenance and security of your User ID and password. You also agree that you will be solely responsible for any activities conducted on or through the site, including any orders placed, in connection with your User ID, regardless of whether or not you are the individual who undertakes such activities. This includes any unauthorized access and/or use of your account or your computer.
If you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your User ID or password, please notify us immediately by contacting us at https://avanticigar.com/contact-us.
MAKING PURCHASES ON THE SITE
Sales of tobacco products are limited to consumers that our age verification efforts indicate are 21 years of age or older. Purchasing tobacco products for younger people is strictly prohibited and may subject you to criminal prosecution.
If you make purchases through the site, those purchases are subject to our standard terms and conditions of sale, available at https://avanticigar.com/terms-of-sale.
Products are sold for personal use only. Therefore, you may not resell or otherwise use any products for commercial use.
We reserve the right to refuse or limit sales of products to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction, and to limit the quantities of products that we offer, all in our sole discretion.
We strive to accurately describe our products or services offered on the site; however, we do not warrant that such specifications, pricing, or other content on the site is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. All descriptions of products and product pricing are subject to change, at any time and without notice. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time.
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND SHARING SITE CONTENT
In addition to the site, we also like to interact with you on third party sites where we post content or invite your feedback, such as through our accounts on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn (“social media sites”). However, we do not control the social media sites, and these terms and our other site policies do not apply to the social media sites. It is your responsibility to review the terms of use and other policies posted on the social media sites.
We may also from time to time include features on the site that allow you to share information from the site, or provide comments and feedback regarding the site, on various social media sites. These interactive features may link to, or require you to log into, one of your social media accounts, or may otherwise access or use your social media account information. This may result in our obtaining information about you (such as your social media account profile picture or other account information) from your social media service provider, and vice versa. Our collection and use of information will be subject to our privacy policy https://avanticigar.com/privacy-policy. However, we are not in control of your social media account or how the social media site providers use your information, which is governed by the setting and privacy policies of the social media sites. Again, you should review the terms of use and other policies posted on the social media sites.
In addition, if you use any social media sharing feature, or if the site features any “send to friend” email link or similar tool that allows you to initiate and send one or more of your friends any communication that includes any site content, or to post site content to any social media site, you may do so only in a manner that does not violate any applicable law, and may only send content to recipients who are at least 21 years old. If you receive anything from us as consideration for sending or posting a message (such as a coupon or reward points based on any information you share), you agree to disclose the receipt of this consideration and to include any specific disclosures otherwise required by us.
USER CONTENT
Certain features of the site that we may offer from time to time may allow you to provide comments and feedback regarding the site, or to post content in other forums on the site. Content provided by you and our other users, including all comments, feedback, reviews, ideas, suggestions, materials, images, information and other submissions, are referred to as “Submissions.”

You understand and agree that we have the right, but not the obligation, to release, publish and/or use any Submissions, any part thereof, in our discretion and for any purpose, including without limitation advertising and promotional activities, product development, and/or any other commercial purposes, without any right of compensation to you or any third party.

Otherwise use the site to engage in any activity, or any other activity that we deem in our sole discretion to be in conflict with the spirit and intent of the site and these terms.

Use the site to establish independent data files or otherwise amass statistical information;

However, we assume no responsibility or liability arising from any use of the site. We are under no obligation to enforce these Acceptable Use Requirements, or any other part of these terms, on your behalf against another user.

By using the site, if you provide us with an e-mail address, such as when using the “Contact Us” or any similar features of the site, creating an account, signing up for our rewards program, or opting into our newsletter, you grant us permission to communicate with you by e-mail for any purposes related to your use of the site, including for any disclosures, system messages and, subject to our obligations under applicable law, other marketing purposes. We will use our best efforts to honor any request to opt out of marketing messages, but under no circumstances will we have any liability for sending you any e-mail.
You agree that any notice, agreement, disclosure or other communication that we send you by e-mail will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communication be in writing.
