Information UseOur lawful ground of processing your personal data to send you marketing communications is either your consent or our legitimate interests (namely to grow our business).Information Use We provide information about trading. Since our customers often have widely differing uses for our products and services, our strongly held belief and experience is that the more we know about our customers, the more value we can offer them. We use the information our customers provide during registration to offer them personalized collection, filtering, and delivery of information (such as strategies and articles) that is of the greatest interest and value to them.Third Party Advertising The ads appearing on our website are delivered to our customers by our Web advertising partners. Information about our customers’ visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address or other contact information), is used to serve ads to users on our website. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by TradingMarkets only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.4. Communications from the SiteSpecial Offers and Updates We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications in these e-mails.Newsletters If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.Service Announcements On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.Customer Service We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.5. SharingLegal Disclaimer Though we make every effort to preserve customer privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.Sharing With Third Parties We do NOT share our customers’ e-mail addresses with third parties, except for when required by law (see legal disclaimer). In order to present our customers with potentially interesting opportunities, we do occasionally share information from certain third parties with you. We believe that our customers will benefit from these arrangements, but out of respect of our clients’ privacy, we will remove such information from disclosure upon request (via e-mail to support@tradingmarkets.com) by our customers.Third Party Intermediaries We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.Choice/Opt-out Our customers are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. Customers who no longer wish to receive our newsletters and promotional communications via e-mail may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the link provided in the e-mail or by sending us an e-mail us at support@tradingmarkets.com.Tell-A-Friend If a customer elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or forwards a TradingMarkets’ commentary to a friend, we ask for the friend’s name and e-mail address.

The friend may contact TradingMarkets at support@tradingmarkets.com to request the removal of this information from our database.Security We take every precaution to protect our customers’ information. When customers submit sensitive information via our website, their information is protected both online and off-line.When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. We restrict all of our customers’ information to our offices, and only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access the information and are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us via e-mail at to support@tradingmarkets.com.Supplementation of Information To fulfill our obligation to our customers, it is sometimes necessary that we supplement the information that we receive with information from third party sources.Address Verification We use RTWare software to verify a customer’s address before completing a charge on a credit card. This procedure protects our customers and us from credit card fraud and other illegal activities.Purchasing History In order for this Web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to a user’s preference, we combine information about a customer’s purchasing habits to create a personalized customer profile.Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information If a customer’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or mailing address), or if a customer no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate the customer’s personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member information page, by e-mailing our Customer Support at support@tradingmarkets.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data? We retain Personal Data about you as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.6.
