FAIRWAY NEEDLEC..
About Us
Welcome to our Store!
Fairway Needlecraft was started by two brothers and their father in 1919.
One brother would print the embroidery pattern on doilies while the other brother would take his bicycle and go to local stores and sell these doilies by the gross.
Their father financed this project.
As the business grew they moved from the upstairs of the fathers house to their first factory location.The depression came and they survived by making ladies aprons.
The business still continued to grow and finally the two brothers split the business, one continuing on with stamped embroidery and the other selling novelty items under the name of Fairway Manufacturing.Fairway Needlecraft moved from the city of St. Louis to its current location in St. Clair
where the factory is located today.
Three generation later, Fairway Needlecraft is still producing high quality stamped for embroidery items.We currently have a very complete line of embroidery items to purchase.
A large selection of quilt blocks, with or without quilting marks. There are many different designs, some with only cross stitch, others with different embroidery stitches or a combination of both cross stitch and embroidery.Doilies with perle edge or with lace will accent any roomDresser scarves with either perle edge or lace edge are available to match our pillowcases and doilies.Pillowcases with perle, lace or our very own ruffled edge to enhance any bedroom.
There are many different designs and many different themes.An area that we are continuing to develop is our Kids crafts.
Currently we have our "Just Color It" pillowcases that are great for birthday parties or 4H project.
The "Learn to Stitch" teaches children how to stitch and make an accent pillow for their bedroom.
The newest addition to this area is our "Wall Art".
This is a unique craft that encompasses painting, stitching, and fabric dyeing.Infant items are always good gifts.
Our 9x9 inch baby blocks or 36x50 inch baby tops offer many different designs to choose from.
