Purchase Terms and Conditions
Reseller Notice: Broadway.com is for the secondary sale of tickets, and the price of a ticket we offer for sale may exceed the established price of the ticket. See below for certain refund guarantees that protect you in the case of a cancelled or postponed event. Broadway.com is not a ticket selling agent of any venue, box office, or event for which tickets are purchased through Broadway.com, and we do not act on their behalf.
Please read these Broadway.com Purchase Terms and Conditions ("Purchase Terms and Conditions") before using this site. By continuing to access or use this site, or any service on this site, you signify YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE BROADWAY.COM PURCHASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. User Acceptance and Consent to Broadway.com Purchase Terms and Conditions.
Welcome to Broadway.com (also referred to herein as the "Broadway Site"). By using or registering for the services offered on the Broadway Site (collectively, the "Broadway Service"), users and the entities or persons they represent ("User" or "Users") agree to be legally bound and abide by the terms, conditions, and notices set forth or referenced herein (the "Purchase Terms and Conditions"). Your continued use of the Broadway Site and the Broadway Service following the posting of any changes to these Purchase Terms and Conditions constitutes acceptance of those changes. In addition, when you purchase any tickets, goods or services on the Broadway Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of each of the purchase policies to which such tickets, goods or services are subject (including, in the case of tickets, the rules and regulations of the venues presenting the events to which such tickets grant you admission). If you do not agree to these Purchase Terms and Conditions, please do not use the Broadway Site and the Broadway Service. Any terms and conditions proposed by you that are in addition to or conflict with these Purchase Terms and Conditions are expressly rejected by Broadway.com and shall have no force or effect. You represent that you have read and agree to be bound by these Purchase Terms and Conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy located at http://www.broadway.com/privacy-policy/ ("Privacy Policy"), our Website Terms of Use located at http://www.broadway.com/terms/("Website Terms of Use"), and our Gift Card Terms and Conditions located at http://www.broadway.com/gc-terms/("Gift Card Terms"), all of which are incorporated herein by reference and which you should review.  These Purchase Terms and Conditions do not apply to purchases through our affiliated entities, Group Sales Box Office, LLC, John Gore Theatrical Group, Inc.

2. Purchase Terms and Conditions; Fees and Payments.
(a) Live Theater Tickets.
Pricing. Broadway.com's pricing for tickets and services are outlined in detail on every transaction. The final total purchase price includes the established Box Office Price (face value) of the tickets (inclusive of all taxes and, depending on the venue, a theater restoration fee or facility fee), and a service and handling fee (“Service Fee”).. Please note that ticket prices listed on Broadway.com reflect current established Box Office prices.  In addition, for an additional fee, clients may choose to add Cancellation Protection (see below) and/or Federal Express or another delivery service.
Service Fee. A Service Fee is added to all tickets purchased on the Broadway Site or over the phone with a Broadway.com phone agent. The Service Fee is calculated based on the established Box Office Price per ticket.
Restoration Fees. Some theater venues charge an additional per ticket restoration or facility fee, which is included in the face value cost. This fee must be passed on to the consumer and is included in the venue's established ticket price.
Ticketing Processes.
i. Request Process. Broadway.com may, from time to time, take ticket orders on a request basis. Such orders are requests for tickets and are not guaranteed. The order is only confirmed when actual seat locations are quoted via a confirmation email or live on the phone by a Broadway.com phone agent.  We will provide a full refund of the purchase price of such tickets if, within 48 hours of our sending you an email confirmation containing your specific seat locations, you contact us and inform us that you are not satisfied with the seat locations that you were provided from the theater box office. Note that this DOES NOT APPLY TO PREMIUM SEAT ORDERS, GIFT CARD REDEMPTIONS, TICKETS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRIVATE TICKET INVENTORY OR TO ORDERS PLACED WITHIN 48 HRS OF THE PERFORMANCE DATE & TIME.  Broadway.com is not liable for accommodations made for travel or lodging or for other consequential damages.
ii. Live Seating. Broadway.com holds a private ticket inventory for certain events and will offer exact seat locations online or over the phone for these events. If you are quoted specific seat locations on the website or over the phone during the ordering process and you complete the sale by providing payment, you will receive a confirmation email confirming the details of your order and guaranteeing your ticket reservation. The order is only confirmed when actual seat locations are quoted via a confirmation email.
Refunds Not Subject to Cancellation Protection:
Cancelled Events:
Events are occasionally cancelled due to reasons beyond our control, such as acts of nature. Also, it is possible that an event will end its run prior to the date for which tickets have been sold. In these cases, a refund will be issued to the purchaser's method of payment PROVIDED THAT WE HAVE THE TICKETS IN HAND.
Refunds for Other Reasons:
Subject to the refund conditions below, Broadway.com will provide a full refund of the amount paid by the purchaser (including, except as set forth below, all fees, regardless of how characterized) if any of the following occurs: (a) the event to which such ticket pertains is cancelled (provided that delivery fees will not be refunded in the event of a cancelled performance); (b) the ticket received by the purchaser does not grant the purchaser admission to the event described on the ticket (unless the ticket is cancelled due to an act or omission by such purchaser); or (c) the ticket fails to conform to its description as advertised (unless the purchaser has pre-approved a substitution of tickets).
Refund Conditions:
The refund will be in the amount of the ticket price plus any applicable Service Fee. Delivery fees for the original order will not be refunded in the event of a cancelled performance. If the tickets were to be left at the venue box office for you to pick them up, we will process the refund without action from you. IF TICKETS HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TOYOU, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO RETURN THEM TO BROADWAY.COM BEFORE ANY REFUND CAN BE ISSUED. Broadway.com is not responsible for the shipping cost you may incur to return tickets to us for a cancelled event. Other than for tickets left at the venue box office for your pick-up, Broadway.com will issue a notice to ticket holders of the cancelled event that will include the time frame within which the tickets must be received  in order for you to receive a refund (typically within two weeks of the date of notice).
If you used a gift card to purchase the ticket, Broadway.com will reissue a new Broadway.com gift card for the original amount.
Refunds Subject To Cancellation Protection:
Cancellation Protection; Refunds and Exchanges. We offer cancellation protection at an additional cost above the cost of your ticket. Cancellation protection is available for $20 per ticket, and can be bought only at the time of your ticket purchase. With this protection, theater tickets may be cancelled up until 4:00PM EST two (2) business days (this excludes all Federal Holidays, Saturdays and Sundays) prior to the actual performance date. You must notify Broadway.com of your intent to cancel by phone at (800) BROADWAY or via email at ticketing@broadway.com no later than two (2) business days prior to the performance. If you have the tickets in your possession, they must be returned to Broadway.com via overnight courier, certified mail or in person to the following address:  Broadway.com, Attention: Customer Service, 729 Seventh Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10019. Broadway.com must receive the tickets at least two (2) business days prior to the performance date printed on the tickets. You must include the order reference number, your daytime phone number and complete mailing address, along with the tickets. If you purchased cancellation protection and comply with the above conditions, you will be issued a refund for the amount of the face value of the tickets, but not for the cost of the cancellation protection, Service Fee, and any applicable handling/delivery fees. On orders without cancellation protection, there are no refunds or exchanges except as otherwise specified above in the section entitled “Refunds Not Subject to Cancellation Protection”. CANCELLATION PROTECTION CANNOT BE PURCHASED FOR PREMIUM SEAT ORDERS, PURCHASE OF GIFT CARDS OR ORDERS PLACED WITHIN 48 HRS OF THE PERFORMANCE DATE & TIME. Cancellation protection will not be offered for these particular types of orders.

Will Call. You may choose to pick up your tickets at the Box Office of the venue.  We recommend that you arrive at least thirty (30) minutes in advance of the event performance time to ensure you have adequate time.
