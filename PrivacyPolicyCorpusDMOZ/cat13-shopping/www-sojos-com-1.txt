Changes to the Agreement; Termination Sojos may at any time: (i) modify or discontinue any part of the Site; (ii) charge, modify, or waive fees required to use the Site; or (iii) offer opportunities to some or all users of the Site.  Sojos reserves the right to make changes to these Terms of Use at any time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon being posted on the Site.  Each time you use the Site, you should review the current Terms of Use.  You can determine when these Terms of Use were last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of these Terms of Use.  Your continued use of the Site will indicate your acceptance of the current Terms of Use; however, any material change to these Terms of Use after your last usage of the Site will not be applied retroactively.  Except for such material changes, the Terms of Use that were in effect at the time any claim or dispute arose between you and us will be applied.   Sojos reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your Account or your use of the Site and to block or prevent future access to and use of the Site (i) if you violate any of these Terms of Use; (ii) for any other reason, or (iii) for no reason.  Upon any such termination, your right to use the Site will immediately cease.   You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site.  Upon termination, all provisions of these Terms of Use which are by their nature intended to survive termination, all representations and warranties, all limitations of liabilities and all indemnities shall survive such termination.   Conditions of Order All Orders placed on our Site are subject to the terms of this Agreement, including the following Conditions of Order. Any purported change submitted by a purchaser of a Product in any additional documentation is hereby expressly rejected.  • Orders.  If you wish to purchase a Product made available through the Site (each, an “Order”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Order, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.  EACH ORDER PLACED THROUGH THE SITE WILL BE MADE DIRECTLY WITH SOJOS.  YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ORDER.  By submitting such information, you grant to us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Orders initiated by you or on your behalf.  Verification of information may be required prior to acknowledgement or completion of any transaction.   • Order Validation and Acceptance.  When you place an Order, we may verify your method of payment, shipping address and/or tax exempt identification number, if any, before processing your Order. Your placement of an Order with us is an offer to purchase our Products. We may accept your Order by processing your payment and shipping the Product, or may, for any reason, decline to accept your Order or any part of your Order.  Any acknowledgement of your Order by us means that your Order request has been received; however, it does not mean that your Order has been accepted or shipped, or that the price or availability of an item has been confirmed.  No Order request shall be considered to be accepted by us until the Product has been shipped.  If we decline to accept your Order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address or other contact information you provided with your Order. Delivery dates provided in connection with any Order are estimates only and do not represent fixed or guaranteed delivery dates. Quantity Limitations We may limit or cancel quantities available for purchase on any Order on any basis, and to alter the availability or duration of any special offers at any time. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per Order.  These restrictions may include Orders placed by or under the same Account, the same credit card, and/or Orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.   Electronic Communication When you place an Order through our Site, you are required to provide a valid email address, which we may use to communicate with you regarding the status of your Order, advise you regarding shipment of backordered Products, and to provide you with any other notices, disclosures or other communications relating to your Order. You agree that we will not be responsible for any damage you incur, or information you do not receive, as a result of your failure to provide a valid email address. Pricing and Product Information We makes every effort to provide current and accurate information relating to the Products and prices, but do not guarantee the currency or accuracy of any such information.  As set forth in Section 4(b) of the Terms of Use, such information is subject to change at any time without notice.  In the event we discover a material error in the description or availability of a Product that affects your outstanding Order with us, or an error in pricing, we will attempt to notify you of the corrected version, and you may choose to accept the corrected version, or cancel the Order. Thereafter, if you choose to cancel the Order, and your credit card has already been charged for a purchase, Sojos will issue a credit to your credit card in the amount of the charge. All prices are in U.S. dollars.   Prices The prices displayed are quoted in U.S. Dollars and are valid and effective only in the United States.   Payment Payment for online Orders may be made by major credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express), or via telephone.  Orders will be processed and shipped pending credit card authorization.  When you place an Order, we will pre-authorize your credit card to ensure the funds are available.  If you are using MasterCard or Visa, or potentially other credit cards, the pre-authorization may appear as if you have been charged.  With some institutions’ payment cards, the funds become unavailable, but the account is not debited until the Order ships.  If you are using a debit card, we will request authorization from your bank for the transaction when your Order is submitted.  Your bank will place a hold on these funds in anticipation of receiving the actual withdrawal from your deposit account.  We do not process the actual charge to your debit card until your Order is shipped; however, we will request another authorization from your bank to verify that the funds remain available if there is a delay from your Order date to our shipping date.  If the Order is cancelled for any reason, the time it takes for the hold to release depends on the issue of the card and is not within our control.   Shipping Shipping and handling charges are assessed on all Orders placed through the Site pursuant to our Shipping Policy found here or on your Order form and are based on the weight, size and value of the Products purchased, as well as location of the shipping address.  We reserve the right to impose additional shipping and handling charges to addresses outside the continental United States  If your item has an additional shipping charge, it will appear in the description area of the item on the product page of the Site or on your Order. Due to the contents of some Products, Orders containing these Products are restricted to standard ground service in the Continental United States only.  Please see Product descriptions for additional details.   When gift cards are purchased with other merchandise, whenever possible, your gift cards will be shipped with that merchandise at no additional costs.  Gift cards purchased separate from merchandise will be assessed a shipping and handling charge, and shipped Standard Service within the United States.   Risk of Loss Except as otherwise set forth herein, the risk of loss for and title to the Products purchased on the Site passes to the purchaser upon Sojos’ delivery of the Product(s) to the carrier.   Taxes Sales tax is currently collected on all purchases to customers shipped to addresses in the State of Minnesota.  If you do not reside in Minnesota you are solely responsible for ensuring the payment of any taxes required by your local jurisdiction.  Late Payments You shall pay us all costs incurred in collecting any past due amount from you, including all court costs, collection costs, and attorney's fees.  Out of Stock If the Product you Order is out of stock at the time you place your Order, you may elect to have it shipped on a subsequent shipment.  Except as otherwise provided on the Site, additional shipping charges will apply to each shipment.  You may elect to have us send you an alert when an out-of-stock Product becomes available. Freight Damage  If you receive merchandise that has been damaged in transit, it is important to keep the shipping carton, packing material and parts intact. Please contact us immediately to initiate a claim.  Our contact information can be found here. Return Policy In most cases, we will accept merchandise returns subject to the return policy found at https://www.sojos.com/sojos-return-policy and will replace the product or refund your money at your option.   QUESTIONS OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
