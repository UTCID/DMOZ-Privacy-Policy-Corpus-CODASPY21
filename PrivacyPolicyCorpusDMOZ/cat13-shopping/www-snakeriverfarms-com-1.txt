These Conditions of Use, along with any other terms and conditions that may appear on the Site from time-to-time (collectively, "Conditions"), set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use and access the Site. BY ACCESSING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS (WITHOUT MODIFICATION), YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE OR ORDER PRODUCTS FROM THE SITE.
1. Use of Site and Content.
1.1 Use of Site. You may access and use the Site solely for your personal use in accordance with these Conditions. You agree not to access or use the Site in any manner that is prohibited by these Conditions or is otherwise unlawful. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your access to, and/or use of, the Site, or any portion thereof, at any time, with or without notice and for any reason (or no reason), and you agree that (a) if your authorization to access the Site is terminated, you will not thereafter access, or attempt to access, the Site, directly or indirectly, and (b) if your authorization to access the Site is suspended, you will not thereafter access, or attempt to access, the Site, directly or indirectly, until your suspension is removed and we give you express notice thereof.

1.4 Product Information and Attributes. We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the attributes of our products that appear on the Site. However, as the actual colors and visual depictions you see will depend on your monitor, your Internet connection and other facts beyond our control, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any exact product attributes will be accurate.

If you register or provide information to us in any manner, including without limitation Online Submissions (as defined below), you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. If we issue a username and/or password to you, you agree to protect such information by, among other things, keeping your password and other information relating to your account confidential. If, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation, you allow another party to use your account, you will be responsible for all use of the Site by the party using your account.
3. Linking and Third Party Dealings.
3.1 Links to External Sites. We may provide hyperlinks to other web sites and Internet resources operated by parties other than AB to C. We have no control over such sites and resources or their privacy policies. Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. The inclusion of hyperlinks to such web sites does not imply any sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the material on such web sites or with their operators.
3.2 Third-Party Dealings. Some portions of the Site may direct you to a web site of a third party. Your dealings or communications through the Site with any party other than us are solely between you and that third party. Please review carefully that third party's policies and practices and make sure you are comfortable with those policies and practices before you engage in any transaction. Any complaints, concerns or questions you may have relating to materials provided by third parties should be forwarded directly to the third party.

AB to C may remove any content of any kind that a user posts to this Web Site ("User Communications"), e.g., if properly informed that the User Communications infringe another's copyright rights. AB to C may terminate the ability to submit User Communications if, under appropriate circumstances, a person submitting User Communications to this Web Site is determined to be a repeat infringer.

(5) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the User Communication(s) or material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
(6) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright right that is allegedly infringed.

5.5 Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy.
Please do not send unsolicited ideas to the Site, including but not limited to ideas for advertising campaigns, promotions, products, product improvements, processes, materials, marketing plans, or product names. Neither AB to C nor any of its employees accept or consider unsolicited ideas. This policy is intended to avoid misunderstandings or disputes when AB to Cs products, services, or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited ideas that were submitted to the Site.
If, despite our request that you not send us your ideas, you still send them, then regardless of what your submission states, the following terms shall apply to your submission: (1) you agree that your ideas will automatically become the property of AB to C, without compensation to you, and you hereby assign and agree to assign to AB to C all rights in and to such, and (2) you agree that AB to C can use the ideas for any purpose and in any wayeven give them to others.
AB to C does, however, welcome your feedback regarding many areas of our existing business. If you want to send us your feedbackand we hope you dojust use our Contact Us page. Please provide only specific feedback on our existing products or marketing strategies (in other words, do not include any unsolicited ideas that our policy will not permit us to accept or consider). The foregoing Section 5.5 does not apply to Online Submissions, which are governed by elsewhere in Section 5.
6. Indemnification.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AB to C and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, shareholders, information providers, suppliers and licensees (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liability and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of (a) your access and/or use of the Site, (b) any breach of any of these Conditions by you or any user of your account, and/or (c) any allegation which, if true, would constitute a breach of any of these Conditions by you or any user of your account.
