When you access the Website, the Company will learn certain information about you during your visit
Information You Provide to Us: The Website provides various places for users to provide information. We collect information that users provide by filling out forms on the Website, communicating with us via contact forms, responding to surveys, search queries on our search feature, providing comments or other feedback, and providing information when ordering a product or service via the Website.
We use information you provide to us to deliver the requested product and/or service, to improve our overall performance, and to provide you with offers, promotions, and information.
Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technology: As you navigate through our Website, we use automatic data collection technologies including Google Analytics to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. This will generally include information about your location, your traffic pattern through our Website, and any communications between your computer and our Website. Among other things, we will collect data about the type of computer you use, your Internet connection, your IP address, your operating system, and your browser type.
The information we collect automatically is used for statistical data and will not include personal information. We use this data to improve our Website and our service offerings. To the extent that you voluntarily provide personal information to us, our systems will associate the automatically collected information with your personal information.
USE OF COOKIES AND PIXELS
Similar to other commercial websites, our Website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
In order to purchase products from the Website, your web browser must be enabled to accept cookies. Among other things, we use cookies to give credit to those sites that direct traffic to the Website for marketing purposes. The Company does not use cookies to store or collect personal information such as full names, addresses, or payment information.
The Company also uses the technological equivalents of cookies, including social media pixels. These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites so as to tailor advertising messages users see while visiting that social media website. The Company reserves the right to use these pixels in compliance with the policies of the various social media sites.
THIRD PARTY USE OF COOKIES
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly and review the privacy policies of each website you visit.
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received online, through mail, and via telephone. This also applies when you register for our Website, sign up through any of our forms using your email address, or make a purchase on this Website. For further information, see the email policies below.

HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US?
We use personal information for purposes of presenting our Website and its contents to you, providing you with information, providing you with offers for products and services, providing you with information about your subscriptions and products, carrying out any contract between you and the Company, administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making available other items and services to our customers and prospective customers.
From time to time, we may use the information you provide to us to make you offers to purchase products and services provided by third parties in exchange for a commission to be paid to us by such third parties. Should you opt to take part in such promotions, the third parties will receive your information.
From time to time, we may use the information you provide to us to display advertisements to you that are tailored to your personal characteristics, interests, and activities.
We may use software programs to create summary statistics from the information we collect, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our Website, assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
As a general rule, we do not sell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer any information collected whether automatically or through your voluntary action.
We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliates, and service providers for the purpose of providing our services to you.
If you opt in for marketing associated with certain online courses, we do share your contact information with the course authors.
If you opt in to take part in third-party promotions offered on our Website, we will share your information with such third parties.
We may disclose your personal information to a third party, including a lawyer or collection agency, when necessary to enforce our terms of service or any other agreement between you and the Company.

We may provide your information to any successor in interest in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company’s assets and/or business.
In other words, we may disclose information when legally compelled to do so when we in good faith believe that the law requires it, for the protection of our legal rights, or when compelled by a court or other governmental entity to do so.
HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION AND SECURE INFORMATION TRANSMISSIONS?
We employ commercially reasonable methods to ensure the security of the information you provide to us and the information we collect automatically. This includes using standard security protocols and working only with reputable third-party vendors. No data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and thus we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.
Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. However, doing so is allowed, but at your own risk. Some of the information you may enter on our Website may be transmitted securely via a secure medium known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL. Credit card and other sensitive information should never be transmitted via email.
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Company uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Those rights include:
• We will retain any information you choose to provide to us until whichever of the following comes first: a) you ask us to delete the information; (b) our decision to cease using our existing data providers; or (c) the Company decides that the value in retaining the data is outweighed by the costs of retaining it.
• You have the right to request access to your personal data that the Company stores and the rights to either correct or erase your personal data or to cease any further dissemination of your personal data. You have the right to have us request that any third party that has received your personal data for an authorized purpose also cease to use and further disseminate your personal data.

• You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data and the right to the portability (export) of a copy of your personal data to you free of charge.
• To the extent that you provided consent to the Company’s processing of your personal data, or your consent to be provided with promotional or marketing materials or information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based upon consent that occurred prior to your withdrawal of consent.
• You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority that has jurisdiction over issues related to the General Data Protection Regulation.
