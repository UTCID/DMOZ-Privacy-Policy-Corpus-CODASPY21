The opinions expressed by third parties reflect solely the opinions of the individuals who submitted such opinions and may not reflect the opinions of order-payments.com.
TRANSACTIONS If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Site (each such purchase, a "Transaction"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Transaction including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant to order-payments.com the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.
All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, and prices of products and services described or depicted on the Site are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures, and other descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The inclusion of any products or services on the Site does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from this Site. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

COLORS order-payments.com strives to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on the Site; however, order-payments.com cannot and does not guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
LIMITATIONS ON QUANTITY order-payments.com does not offer additional discounts on large orders of a single item or on large orders of many individual items. In addition, we reserve the right to limit quantities on orders placed by the same account, on orders placed by the same credit card, and on orders that use the same billing or shipping address. We will notify you if such limits are applied.
AVAILABILITY, ERRORS, AND INACCURACIES If an item is out of stock, order-payments.com may, in its sole discretion and at no extra cost to you, substitute another item for the out-of-stock item if order-payments.com, in its sole discretion, determines that the identical brand and product is available in a form that is of equal or greater value, for example, larger quantity, packaged with a trial sample, or with updated product packaging.
order-payments.com's acknowledgement of an order means that your order request has been received; it does not mean that your order has been accepted or shipped or that the price or availability of an item has been confirmed. order-payments.com makes a conscientious effort to describe and display its products and services accurately on the Site. Despite these efforts, a small number of items on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information on the Site and in our advertising on other sites. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. order-payments.com reserves the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice. We apologize for any inconvenience. As part of our shipping procedures, we verify the availability and the price before an item is shipped. If an item's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and ship you the item. If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, if the item is no longer available, or if we determine that there were inaccuracies in our product information, we will cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation via email. Please see our Pricing Policy for more details. The Pricing Policy is incorporated into these Terms & Conditions in its entirety.
RISK OF LOSS Except as otherwise set forth herein, the risk of loss for and title to products purchased on the Site passes to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide order-payments.com's copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying order-payments.com that your copyrighted material has been infringed. order-payments.com does not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, order-payments.com will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. order-payments.com may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, order-payments.com is required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content ("Alleged Infringer").

Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular Site activities or communications. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys' fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.
To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by fax, regular mail, or email only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
A DMCA notice must:
1. Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, "My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located]."); 2. Identify the Content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Site. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible; 3. Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available); 4. If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred); 5. Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law"; 6. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed"; 7. Be signed; and 8. Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address: DMCA Designated Agent 640 Glenoaks Blvd email: cs@order-payments.com

HEALTHCARE INFORMATION THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE HEALTH CARE PAGES OF THE SITE IS INTENDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
