Your Data is Important
: It is important to note that, as an eCommerce site, we do collect, use and store data in order to deliver the goods and services you request from us. While we are required to share some data with vendors in order to process credit cards, deliver packages and stream video, we DO NOT resell any data to third parties FOR ANY REASON. Specifically, we DO NOT resell or make available your personal data so that others can sell you stuff you don't want. We are in the business of delivering the best possible customer experience we can and we use information to help us accomplish this goal.
The European Union, to grant people greater visibility into and control over how their data is used, passed legislation that requires companies to gain the active consent from users to collect, use and store data. To comply with this legislation (known as GDPR), we are making a variety of updates to our policies and processes, but there is no change in our fundamental approach to how we use your personal data:
we only use your data to help you find relevant products and to deliver your products.

This section provides information about the circumstances in which your personal data may be transferred between different countries, including countries outside the European Union (EU).
Generally, we may transfer your personal data between different jurisdictions.
However, in doing so we will comply with the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC ("GDPR") and other applicable laws regulating the protection for the transfer of personal information between jurisdictions.
This means that we may transfer your data to the United States, the EU, or other countries.
If you are a European resident, we will endeavor to confirm that either the European Commission has determined that the receiving jurisdiction provides adequate protection of personal data or that other appropriate safeguards are in place, namely the use of relevant standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.
We maintain hosting facilities in
Canada and the US
. The exact locations of CDN servers processing data from our Website is dependent upon user location and traffic loads - none of which is within our control. CDNs are used to increase the performance of our Website and speed up delivery content to users located in different locations around the globe.
Any category of Personal Data may reside in our hosting facilities and/or CDNs for the purposes of providing the services you have requested through our Website and for other purposes set forth as to each such category.
To our knowledge the European Commission has made an "adequacy decision" with respect to the adequacy of any data protection laws of Canada and the United States (under the Privacy Shield framework). To our knowledge the European Commission has not made an "adequacy decision" with respect to the adequacy of any data protection laws of Curacao and we have no knowledge as to the exact locations of our provider's CDN servers.
Transfers of your personal data to Curacao will be protected by the fact that all members of our group with access to your personal data have agreed to comply with the GDPR, and by other appropriate safeguards, namely the use of relevant standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.
We maintain a relationship with one or more entities in the
United States
that perform website development, customer service and marketing services for our group.
Website development typically does not involve the transfer of Personal Data but website developers may from time to time have access to information stored on our servers located in Canada for the purposes of performing their work.
Customer service may involve access to or the transfer of your Personal Data from our servers in Canada to our service provider but may also include information you provide directly when interacting with our customer service department located in the United States.
Marketing services may require access to or transfer of your Personal Data stored on our servers in Canada for the purposes of providing you with marketing services you have requested, including email address, user ID, postal codes, category preferences and the aggregate amount you may have spent utilizing this Website.
We maintain a relationship with one or more service providers in the United States to handle the fulfillment of any orders of tangible goods you have ordered from our Website and we provide them with Account data, Customer Contact Data and Sales Data to the extent necessary to deliver such goods to you.
The European Commission has made an "adequacy decision" with respect to the adequacy of any data protection laws of the United States (under the Privacy Shield framework).
In connection with our processing of payments made by you in connection with goods or services you purchase, we use third-parties in Europe to provide banking and credit card processing.
When you purchase goods or services from our Website, payment is typically processed via your direct interaction with a webpage provided and controlled by the payment processor.
We may share Account Data, Customer Contact Data, and Sales Data with these processors to the extent relevant and necessary to process your payments, refunds, or adjustments necessary in connection with your request to purchase goods and services from our Website, to comply with legal, regulatory, and banking requirements concerning money laundering, attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business. We have no knowledge or control over such third parties and/or their data practices and any information you enter with such banks and credit card processors is subject to such privacy policies as are maintained by such providers. We are neither liable nor responsible for identifying or otherwise notifying any person regarding changes in any third party's privacy policies or their actions or omissions pertaining to such information.
In any event, transfers of your personal data to any jurisdiction as to which the European Commission has not made an "adequacy determination" we will endeavor to impose appropriate safeguards, namely the use of relevant standard data protection clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission.
You acknowledge that User Content Data that you voluntarily submit for publication through our Website or services may be available, via the Internet, around the world. Examples of such information could, depending upon the nature of your User Content Data, include personal data.
We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such data by others.
Data Retention Policy
There are two main categories of data we are primarily concerned with: Personal Data (all of the information that identifies a particular customer (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.) and Sales Data (the purchases any customer may make). We undertake that we will not retain your personal data for periods that are longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was obtained and/or held for processing. We must, however, retain sales data for a minimum of seven years in order to comply with the requirements of various legal and financial regulatory agencies. As a result, in addition to a user's ability to export/modify/purge personal data from our system, we have a two-tiered approach to purging personal and sales data.
Generally speaking, we will retain your personal data for a minimum period of three (3) years following the last day in which you interacted with us regarding the purpose for which the personal data was obtained and processed.
For example, we will retain Sales Data related to any sale for a minimum of three (3) years from the date the relevant goods or services were delivered to or, in the case of streaming video, used by you.
In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we undertake to determine a period of retention based upon the relevant applicable statute of limitations as concerns any claim you may have as against each other based upon your interaction with the Website and/or the order or delivery of any goods or services and to attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business.
In any event, we may retain your personal data where retention is necessary for legal or regulatory compliance purposes or in order to protect the vital interests of either of us or of a third party.
It is important to note that once personal data is purged either by request or our data retention policy, there will be no way for the customer or our customer service department to access any of the data or digital products stored on our servers and associated with that account.
Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:
Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website.

contactus@romantixinc.com = Data Privacy Rights - Unsubscribe. If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you may send us a return e-mail asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions.

You can review and change some of your Personal Data and some other Non-Personal Data information about you by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page.
However, your right to change or delete information is subject to exceptions generally referenced in this Privacy Policy.

Special Rights For European Residents.
If you reside in the European Union you may have additional rights as set forth under the GDPR.
The GDPR is a complex regulatory scheme and we have not provided an exhaustive summary in this Policy.
We advise you to read the relevant regulation and guidance provided by the relevant regulatory authorities for a full explanation of your rights.
Your principal rights under the GDPR are access, rectification, erasure, processing restriction or objection, portability, withdrawal of consent and the right to complaint to a regulatory authority.
These rights are not absolute and exceptions apply.
For example, we may not accommodate a request to delete or change information if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests or the change would violate any law or regulation or if retention is necessary to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information, comply with a legal obligation, attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business, to protect the vital interests of you, us, or any third party, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
If the legal basis for our processing your personal data is your consent, or the necessity to comply with your requests, or for the performance of a contract we have with you, and we are automatically processing your personal data, you have the right to receive from us a copy of such personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time subject to applicable exceptions. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.
