1. Acceptance of the Terms
The SugarInstant
Web Site is made up of various Web sites and Web pages that are owned and operated by

("SugarInstant ") (collectively, the "Websites").
The following Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Websites.
Read these terms carefully before you ("You") accept these Terms by: (a) placing an order through SugarInstant
or (b) otherwise using the Websites.
Additionally, the Websites may themselves contain additional terms, codes of conduct or guidelines that govern use of those websites, including without limitation, particular features or offers (for example, free trials, sweepstakes or chat areas).
In the event that any of the Terms contained herein conflict with any additional terms contained within any Website, then these Terms shall control.
Your use of the Websites constitutes Your Agreement to the Terms and any additional terms.
The Terms are entered into by and between SugarInstant and You.
Any reference herein to SugarInstant
shall be deemed to refer to SugarInstant and/or the Websites, as applicable under the circumstances.
The products offered for sale or rent and other on-line resources accessible via the Websites, are provided to You, subject to these Terms.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Terms will govern Your use of any new features that augment or enhance the Websites.
SugarInstant, and any third-party providers of content to the Websites, may make improvements and/or changes to the Websites including the products, programs, services and prices that are offered or described on the Websites, at any time, without prior notice.
In addition, SugarInstant does not warrant that the products offered on the Websites are available to be shipped to all customers or that product descriptions or other content of the Websites is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
If a product offered on the Websites is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return the product in unused condition.
You acknowledge that the Websites contain sexually oriented adult material intended for individuals 18 years of age or older and of legal age to view sexually explicit material as determined by the local and national laws of the region in which You reside.
You agree not to enter the Websites if you are not 18 years of age or older, if sexually oriented adult material offends you, or if you are accessing the Websites from any community or country where adult material is specifically prohibited by law.
2. Modification to Terms of Use
SugarInstant reserves the right to update or modify these Terms and, any additional terms, codes of conduct or guidelines, without prior notice.
You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms and Your continued use of the Websites constitutes Your agreement as to all such updated or modified terms.
3. Intellectual Property Rights
Unless otherwise indicated, all information, images, text, messages, illustrations, graphics, logos, designs, icons, photographs, programs, data, software, music, sound, video, or other materials that are part of the Websites (collectively, the "Content") are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, publicity rights, or other proprietary rights and laws owned, controlled or licensed by SugarInstant or by third parties (the "Third Party Providers") who have provided materials to SugarInstant, and these rights are valid and protected in all forms, media and technologies, existing now or hereinafter developed.
All Content is copyrighted as a collective work under the U.S. copyright laws, and SugarInstant owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement, and enhancement of such Content.
Except as set forth herein, none of the Content may be copied, reproduced, framed, modified, removed, sold, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, transmitted, or otherwise exploited, in whole or in part, in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without the prior express written permission of SugarInstant or the Third Party Provider.
No part of the Websites may be reproduced or retransmitted in any way, or by any means, without the express written permission of SugarInstant.
You also may not, without SugarInstant's prior express written permission, "mirror" any of the Content contained on the Websites on any other server.
SugarInstant is committed to respecting others' intellectual property rights, and we ask our users to do the same.
SugarInstant may, in its sole discretion, terminate the accounts or access rights of users who infringe or otherwise violate others' intellectual property rights.
If You believe that Your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement on the Websites, please contact our copyright agent as described in our Copyright Policy.
Nothing on the Websites shall be construed as conferring any license under any of SugarInstant's or any Third Party Provider's intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication, or otherwise.
You acknowledge sole responsibility for obtaining any such licenses.
Permission is granted to display, copy, distribute and download SugarInstant's Content on the Websites for Your personal, non-commercial use only, provided You do not modify the materials and that You retain all copyright notices, trademark legends, and other proprietary rights notices contained in the materials.

SugarInstant respects
Your desire for privacy. SugarInstant's Privacy Policy can be found at here.
By using the Websites, You are consenting to the processing of Your data by SugarInstant and consenting to the terms of our Privacy Policy.

11. Site Security
You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Websites, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which You are not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Websites, overloading, "flooding," "spamming," "mailbombing" or "crashing;" (d) sending unsolicited email, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; or (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting.
Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
SugarInstant will investigate occurrences that may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enf-rcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such violations.
You agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Websites or any activity being conducted on the Websites.
You agree, further, not to use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Websites other than the search engine and search agents available from SugarInstant on the Websites and other than generally available third party web browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer).
12. Termination of Use
SugarInstant, in its sole discretion, may terminate Your password, Your account, Your use of any of the on-line resources available on the Websites, and remove and discard any Content on the Websites, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if SugarInstant believes that You have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms.
Any termination of Your access to the Websites under any provision of the Terms may be effected without prior notice, and SugarInstant may immediately de-activate or delete Your account and all related information and files in Your account and/or bar any further access to such files or to the Websites.
Further, SugarInstant will not be liable to You or any third-party for any termination or suspension of Your Account or Your access to the Websites.
13. General Information
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and SugarInstant and govern Your use of the Websites, superseding any prior agreements between You and SugarInstant (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms).
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use other SugarInstant services, third-party content or third-party software. You must not assign or otherwise transfer either the Terms or any right granted hereunder.
Any breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to SugarInstant for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, SugarInstant will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs.
You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if SugarInstant seeks such an injunction.
Pennsylvania law and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms.
No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction apply.
You and SugarInstant agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
SugarInstant controls and operates the Websites from its headquarters in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States of America, and makes no representation that this Content is appropriate or available for use in other locations. If You use the Websites from other locations, You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws including but not limited to the export and import regulations of other countries.
The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of technology originating in the United States.
This includes the electronic transmission of information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals.
You agree to abide by these laws and their regulations including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Act and the Arms Export Control Act and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the Website to either a foreign national or a foreign destination in violation of such laws.
The failure of SugarInstant to exercise or enf-rce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full f-rce and effect.
REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.
The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
These Terms represent the entire understanding relating to the use of the Websites and prevail over any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting, or additional, communications.
