This privacy
statement discloses the privacy practices for all websites operated by Earl Miller Photography, Inc.
Earl Miller Photography, Inc.
("EMPI") is committed to preserving the privacy of data entrusted to
us. We have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you of our information gathering
and usage practices employed on any and/or all of the websites we operate.
If you feel that this company

Information
Collection and Use
EMPI is
the sole owner of the information collected on this site.
We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different
from what is disclosed in this statement.
EMPI collects information from our users at several different points on
our website.
Registration
In order to use the member section of this website, a user must
first complete the registration/join form.
During registration a user is required to give their contact information
(such as name and email address).  This
information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which
they have expressed interest.  Occassionally,
we may ask for additional information beyond what is required for billing and
for us to contact you. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information
(such as income level and gender), and Internet usage information (such as how
often you access the Internet), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized
experience on our site.
Order
We may request information from users on an order form when users
order something that must be shipped.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and
shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration
date).  This information is used
for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used
to get in touch with the user.
Cookies
We may use cookies on our sites to speed your access to our site.
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the users hard drive containing information
about the user.  Usage of a cookie
is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our
site.  Once the user closes their
browser, the cookie simply terminates.
For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have
to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.
The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas
of our site.  For example, the user
will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly
Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the
interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
It is
possible that some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers).  However, we have
no access to or control over these cookies.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track
user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses are generally not linked to personally identifiable information
except in forums, message boards and possibly chat rooms to minimize fraudulent
postings (a user impersonating another user, for example).
Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information with our
partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that
can identify any individual person.
We use an outside shipping
company to ship merchandise orders, and a credit card processing company to
bill users for goods and services.
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware
that we [SMG] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read
the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected
by this Web site.
Newsletter
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we may ask
for contact information such as name in addition to email address. Our newsletters
and other email list are double opt-in and double opt-out. This means that the
subscribe must reply to an email our system sends in order to successfully be
added or removed to our list. We don't promote or tolerate spamming.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users
via surveys or contests.  Participation
in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore
has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).
Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
the use and satisfaction of this site.
Affiliates
Many
of our sites participate in our Earl Miller Cash affiliate program where other webmasters
can refer business to us in exchange for sharing revenue generated by that referral.
We have strict Terms and Conditions regulating how our affiliates may promote
our sites. If you believe one of our affiliates is acting outside of acceptance
practices to promote one of our sites, please contact us at the address above
or by email at support@earlmillercash.com.
Security
This website
takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
When your submit sensitive information via the website, your information
is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order
form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or
social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with
the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
While we use SSL encryption
to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power
to protect user-information off-line.
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
above, is restricted in our offices.  Only
employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally
identifiable information.  Furthermore,
ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added,
our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on
privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information
on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a camera-monitored
facility.
If you have any questions
about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@earlmiller.com.
Special
Offers
We send all new
members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members
will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals,
and a newsletter.
Site
and Service Updates
We also send the
user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe
from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.
We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to
issues relating to their account via email or phone.
Correction/Updating
Personal Information:
If a user’s personally
identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer
desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or
remove that user’s personal data provided to us.
This can usually be done at the member information page
or by emailing our Customer Support.
[Some sites may also provide telephone or postal mail options for updating
or correcting personal information].
Choice/Opt-out
Our users are
given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes
not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.
For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy
a product from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email
address off of our lists.
Users who no longer wish
to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out
of receiving these communications by clicking an unsubscribe in any of our emails
or by emailing us at support@earlmiller.com
Users of our site are always
notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.
We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they
should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.
Notification of
Changes
If we decide to
change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our privacy page on
all of our sites so our users are always aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will
notify users by way of an email.  Users
will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
which the information was collected.
