Privacy
Policy
We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices
with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal
information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site,
you signify your assent to our privacy practices and the terms and conditions
of our Web site. If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not
use this site.
What type information is collected?
We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site
when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration
form or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors
to provide us with information including, but not limited to, their
name, physical address, email address, birth date, username, password,
and on occasion a unique identifier.
When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information
may be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser
type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g.,
Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they
accessed the site (e.g., google.com). In addition, we may collect information
about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit
the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the
amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor
returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking
pixels to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent
to us through our affiliate network. We do not track any information
about visitors once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text
files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web
site) to collect this information. Information collected through cookies
may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow
unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to
visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies,
but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our
Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains
how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the
browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase
cookies from their hard drives.
In what way do we use your personal and non-personal information?
Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors
with the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers
with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little
about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and
advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information
collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following purposes:
(1) to send visitors information and promotional materials about our
company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials
from our marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on
our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display advertisements and offers
by email (by matching criteria provided by our advertisers with information
collected from our visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our Web site
when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to proprietary
content by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction
screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and credit or charge
card information (among other things), as provided by that visitor,
(6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our
Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine
the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand
visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity
of our site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting
internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater
online experience for our visitors.
What security measures do we take to protect your data?
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and
ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
the information we collect from visitors to our Web site. We use SSL
(Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect any credit card information
you provide us. We allow access to personal information only to persons
and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy.
Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us
(such as data, questions or answers, comments, suggestions, or communications
submitted to a chat room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable
or responsible if information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted
and used by an unintended recipient.
We protect children's privacy.
Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that
reason we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under
the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the
age of 18 (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our
site.
Corporate changes.
In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy,
or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our
assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal information
collected from visitors to our Web site.

You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically

practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party
