Babeland consistently strives to provide new and innovative products and services as part of its commitment to better serve its customers. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we operate ourselves in a manner consistent with the protection of your privacy. We developed this Privacy Policy pursuant to applicable law regarding the collection and use of Personally Identifying Information ("PII") (defined below) in those jurisdictions where we do business. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected, including PII through websites that Babeland owns or operates and those sites operated on behalf of Babeland that contain a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively the "Website"), how we use that information, how we share it as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. This Privacy Policy is also designed to inform you about how you may access, amend, or delete PII collected and how you may limit Babeland's use of your PII. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy in its entirety and hope it will help you make an informed decision about sharing your PII with us. On occasion, the Website is connected by "hyperlinks" to other companies' websites; please note that Babeland is not responsible in any way for the privacy practices of other websites and suggests that you review the privacy policies of those other companies' websites before using them.

What types of PII does Babeland collect?
Your privacy on the Internet is important to Babeland. As part of the operation of the Website, certain pieces of information are gathered about the users registering to gain access to the site (individually, a "Registrant" and collectively, "Registrants").
Personally Identifying Information
"Personally Identifying Information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, company name, physical address, phone numbers, email address and any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact you. Babeland asks for your PII so that it can understand your needs, determine if Babeland products meet your needs, inform you about its products that it believes may be of interest to you, or comply with the law. Of course, you may choose not to provide Babeland with PII; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Website. Our server does not automatically record PII. Such information can become known to Babeland via its Website only when you voluntarily submit it. Your knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of your PII. However, Babeland may also receive PII through various social media platforms, websites or services or from other sources.
Usage Data and Site Activity
On each visit to Babeland's Website, Babeland may collect certain limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit the Website. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, as well as the date and time of your visit ("Usage Data"). We use this information to operate, develop, and improve the Website. This information does not include your PII. Our server does not automatically record PII. Such information can become known to Babeland via the Website when you voluntarily submit it. We may disclose to third parties Usage Data regarding our Website. Your Usage Data may be aggregated with the Usage Data of others and not identify you individually or it may include associated data that does identify you.
How Does Babeland Use Your PII?
Babeland only collects the information that it needs in order to deliver products and information to you. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Babeland will not give, rent, loan, or otherwise make available your PII to third parties without your consent. By making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with Babeland or other organization after visiting the Website, a Registrant is choosing to provide Babeland with PII in such Registrant's sole discretion.
Cookies
Babeland and our affiliates and other partners use cookies and other identification technologies on our websites, mobile applications, email communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the "Services") for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends. A cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to you. We use cookies to generally understand the online behaviors and interests of people who interact with our products and services online.
You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of how our digital services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the "Help" or "Preferences" menu. Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link, and we have indicated where this is possible in the table below.
Marketing
As part of its day-to-day business activities, Babeland may share with third parties certain non-personally identifying log information your browser makes available whenever you visit the Website.
Security
Due to the existing legal, regulatory and security environment, Babeland may disclose aggregate level and/or PII about its Registrants to protect the rights, property or safety of Babeland, our customers, or the public.
Sale or Transfer of Business
We may sell or otherwise transfer such information to a successor of Babeland, or any subsidiary or division of Babeland in connection with an asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, divestiture, stock sale, purchase of part or all of the assets of the business, or other corporate transaction, or by way of assignment (whether by operation of law or otherwise) in connection with any such or similar transaction or in connection with the administration of a bankruptcy estate. In the case of such event, the PII will become the property of the successor and will be subject to the successor's Privacy Policy should they have one.
Service Providers and Partners
So that we can focus on providing customers with a quality product, we may establish relationships with other businesses whom we believe, based on a reasonable inquiry, to be trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with our requirements (collectively "Service Providers"). For example purposes only, Babeland may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services such as hosting and maintenance, payment processing and certain marketing and promotions functions. We only provide the Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform their services on our behalf.
User Content
Babeland may post on the Website stories, comments, letters, photographs and/or videos provided to us by our customers. When you submit the materials and other information to us you represent that you are authorized to submit such materials or other information and you grant to Babeland a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license, with the right to sub-license, to reproduce, distribute, transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display and publicly perform any materials and other information (including, without limitation, ideas contained therein for new or improved products) you submit to any public areas of the Website (such as bulletin boards, forums and newsgroups), e-mail to babeland.com or any other means and in any media now known or hereafter developed. You also grant to Babeland the right to use your name in connection with the submitted materials and other information as well as in connection with all advertising, marketing and promotional material related thereto. You agree that you shall have no recourse against Babeland for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in your submitted materials and other information to the Website.
Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions.
If you choose to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion (collectively "Promotion"), your PII may be disclosed to third parties in connection with such Promotion, including without limitation, for purposes of posting your entry with attribution or otherwise as permitted in the applicable official rules for the Promotion, fulfilling your prize or including your name on a winners list. Also by entering a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may require you to consent to the use of your personal information or other information, such as name, voice or likeness, in advertising, promotional and marketing materials. In addition, we may offer certain promotional content, such as sweepstakes, sponsored or co-branded with a third party, who may obtain the personal information that you submit.
How does Babeland protect your PII?
Babeland protects your PII by using safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. Each of our employees with access to your PII is informed about our Privacy Policy and procedures for protecting PII. Babeland undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual Registrants and, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Babeland.
You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your user name and password are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, neither Babeland's network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Registrant's information, Babeland cannot ensure or warrant the security of member information. Thus, any information a Registrant transmits to us is done so at the Registrant's own risk. Once we receive Registrant information, we undertake substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Babeland may store and process PII collected on the Website on its own servers or on the servers of its Service Providers (defined below). Paper copies containing all or part of the PII you supply to us may be made and kept in file cabinets as part of the course of normal business activity. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Although we take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data, Babeland does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of PII. In the event of a security breach whereby your PII is acquired by an unauthorized person, Babeland will take commercially reasonable steps to contain the breach and to notify you of the unauthorized acquisition.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us. The Website is intended for users who are 18 years old or older. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received PII from a child under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our records. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide PII without parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided PII, please contact us, and we will take appropriate action.

The entire contents of the Website are protected by international copyright and trademark laws. The owner of the copyrights and trademarks is The Barnaby LTD or other third parties.
