Terms and Conditions
This Agreement states the Terms and Conditions upon which you may use this Web Site (the “Site”). Please read this page carefully. By using the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement between you and Lucas Entertainment, Inc. (the “Company”), and to abide by the terms and conditions set forth herein. In addition, when using specific services, you agree to abide by any guidelines or rules posted in connection with those services, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
If you do not agree with any posted terms or rules, or with any part of this Agreement, you must not use the Site. This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time, and changes are effective upon posting at the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any changes to this Agreement means that you accept and agree to abide by such changes. If you do not comply with this Agreement at all times when using the Site, the Company reserves the right to deny or restrict your access to the Site. You should visit this page periodically to review the Terms and Conditions, because they are binding on you.
BILLING
If you purchase services (including regular and trial subscriptions) from the Site, your payment will be processed securely by one of our designated Billing Companies.
The Billing Company also provides customer service for billing and payment issues, including processing cancellation of trial subscriptions and regular subscriptions and issuing credits in connection with unauthorized transactions. Please keep a record of the transaction ID number provided when you subscribe, and follow the instructions for obtaining assistance with billing-related questions.
TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS
If you decide to cancel your trial subscription, you must do so at least one day prior to the first monthly rebill date referenced at the bottom of your first transaction receipt. If you do not cancel at least one day prior to the end of the Trial Period, you are agreeing to continue as a regular subscriber upon the terms and conditions for regular subscriptions set forth herein, and you authorize the Company or its authorized Billing Company to charge your credit card (or other approved payment facility) at the then-current monthly rate on a recurring basis until you terminate your subscription.
REGULAR SUBSCRIPTIONS
If you purchase a regular subscription, or if you purchase a trial subscription and do not cancel at least one day prior to the end of the Trial Period, you hereby authorize the Company or its designated Billing Company to charge your credit card (or other approved payment facility) for periodic recurring subscription fees according to the then-current billing terms for the Site. If you cancel your subscription, your termination becomes effective at the end of the current billing period, otherwise your subscription will be automatically renewed for successive 30 day periods, and your credit card (or other approved payment facility) will be charged at the then-current subscription rate. Subscription fees are earned upon receipt and are non-refundable, whether or not termination is at your request. Subscription rates are subject to change at any time without notice. You are liable for any subscription charges incurred by you up to and until termination of your subscription to the Site.
If you purchase other goods or services offered on the Site, you authorize the Company or its authorized Billing Company to charge your credit card (or other approved payment facility) for any and all such purchases. You agree not to report as lost or stolen any credit card which you have used in conjunction with payment to the Company  for goods or services that you do not have good reason to believe is, in fact, lost or stolen. You further agree not to report as unauthorized any charge for goods or services that you have, in fact, ordered from the Company. You hereby agree that any such false reporting of a lost or stolen credit card or of unauthorized charges shall render you liable to the Company for liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000.00. The liability for liquidated damages specified in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other liability you may have for breach(es) of any other terms, conditions, promises and warranties set forth in this Agreement.
You must promptly inform the Company and/or the Billing Company handling your subscription of changes in the expiration date of any credit card used in connection with the Site; changes in home or billing address; and any actual or suspected apparent breaches of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of an ID or password. Until you notify the Company and/or the relevant Billing Company of a breach in security, you will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the Site. The Company will provide you with copies of billing records documenting charges for use of the Site upon request.
REFUND POLICY
Refunds for purchases or recurring charges may be requested by contacting customer support. Lucas Entertainment reserves the right to grant a refund or a credit applicable to purchases of any form at its discretion. Should a refund be issued for any reason, it will be credited solely to the payment method used in the original transaction. Lucas Entertainment does not provide refunds in the form of cash, check, or to another payment mechanism. We may, however, grant credits in the form of free monthly memberships to resolve customer service issues. The billing systems used by Lucas Entertainment or our authorized agents provide extensive credit card fraud protection measures and our Sites include many features to protect users from accidental charges. Lucas Entertainment does not offer refunds for any Lucas Tokens purchased.
