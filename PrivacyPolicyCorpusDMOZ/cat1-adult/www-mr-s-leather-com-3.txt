When we are able to bring our support staff back we’ll be more than happy to answer all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding and patience during this time.

Out of Stock Items:
If an item if unavailable to add to your cart, then we are currently out of stock. Our workshop is closed, so leather items will not be restocked until after all this is over. We deeply regret that we cannot bring all our staff back to fill your needs for these items. Other items are arriving daily and our site is constantly being updated as stock arrives.
Shipping ETA:
We are getting a lot of orders out each day. However, please give 1-2 business days for us to process your order. If you pay for 1-Day, 2-Day or 3-Day UPS on orders placed before noon, we’ll do our very best to see they leave that day.
Custom Work:
As our workshop is closed, we will not be able to take any requests for non-standard items until further notice. We are very sorry for this inconvenience.
