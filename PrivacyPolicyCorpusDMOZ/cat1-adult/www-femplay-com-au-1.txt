YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS TO US
Your privacy is absolutely our number one priority at all times. Privacy, security and discretion are the foundation of Femplay!

Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information - In most circumstances, information collected by Femplay is used on an aggregate basis.  This means the information of customers are grouped together which does not reveal the personal information of any particular user.  This aggregated information is primarily used to evaluate our business in areas of products and services.

Your email address will be used strictly to communicate the status of the order, and for other order specific customer service tasks.However, you will receive emails if you subscribe to our newsletter to receive special offers, notification of new products etc. You may unsubscribe from this service at any time.
Payment information is not fully retained or stored by Femplay. The first and last 4 digits of the credit card is retained for purposes of verifying the card number for refunds at a later date.

SECURE ORDERING
Throughout the entire ordering process your credit card details and other personal information such as cardholder name are encrypted with 256 bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protection.
When the Femplay ordering system was designed we were happy with this level of security, but we wanted to go one step further and completed PCI compliance in 2014.
