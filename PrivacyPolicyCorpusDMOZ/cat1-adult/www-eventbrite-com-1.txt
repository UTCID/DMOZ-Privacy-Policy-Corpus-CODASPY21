This workshop is an overview of my point of view about how to shift from numb hiding to juicy alive presence + visibility.My name is Kellita and I want to invite you to come and join us for this introduction to Showgirl Awakening.---This
could be for you if you…* are drawn to dance, improv, costume-like-clothing and glitter as well as embodied movement-based practices (e.g. yoga, zumba, improv theater, latin dance, belly dance, cabaret, show dance + burlesque) even if they intimidate you.* get it that “self-care” is important, but want to do it with more sizzle + vivaciousness than meditation + yoga alone offers.* chronically over-manage, over-edit & over-give and have a hard time saying ‘no’ to helping people so you feel burned out in their life.* can’t live without beauty (whether it be enjoying delicious food and drink, a beautifully decorated home, a variety of clothing that suits your aesthetic).* are drawn to mysticism, oracles, authors, elders and poets like Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Caroline Casey, Ane Axford, Sarah Peyton, Charles Eisenstein, Hafiz, Khalil Gibran, Carla Camou and Carl Buchheit.* have been trying with all their might, mind, body & life-force to make everything OK for everyone & are beginning to realize that that’s a dead end, impossible mission.* are drawn to the idea that creative expression + psychological + spiritual growth can all happen in one embodied place.* want your transformation to be both deep and light - you want it to feel fun, even as you face your edges of really feeling what you feel, and allowing yourself to be seen, by yourself and others, as you truly are, and as you truly wish to be seen.---At its heart, this workshop is all about exploring the question:"How can it feel good to be me, in a body, with needs + desires, and still belong in ways that matter to me?"Too much attention to editing (even by gifted choreographers or adept people pleasers) creates a barrier to being seen.I believe that whether it’s in a social situation, a performance setting or even intra-personally (meaning you on you!) it’s always most effective to make sure it feels good to YOU, rather than make it “work” for the other person or the audience or even the critic within.So . . .How do you “perform”--in any area of your life--and maintain (or access to begin with, for that matter) your authenticity. Where is the barometer for that? And is it possible to experience that the more authentically you are exposing yourself--in just the ways you are choosing to--the more connection you are setting yourself up to experience with other people with whom you desire connection? I believe it is.---This workshop is ideal for women who are:* highly sensitive--HSP-- and looking for psychological growth and spiritual empowerment in a way that honors their sensitivity* instinctively drawn to dance & performance as expression, yet convinced they don’t have the necessary training, skill or guts to do it well (or to the level they can vaguely imagine would feel wonderful)* chronically over-manage, over-edit & over-give and have a hard time saying ‘no’ to helping people so they feel burned out in their life* have been trying with all their might, mind, body & life-force to make everything OK for everyone & are beginning to realize that that’s a dead end, impossible mission* get it that “self-care” is important, but want to do it with more sizzle & vivaciousness than meditation & yoga alone offers* are suffering from injured instinct, and are keen to rediscover their voice and trust themselves* are been there, done that with therapy (perhaps years or decades, even) and still don’t have the change they wish---While gathered with like-minded peers, during this workshop you'll:* Learn how the the 3 Pillars of Showgirl Awakening--REVEL, REVEAL + RECEIVE--are the key to being present for, enjoy and be the subject of your own life.* Practice The Six Core Movements that support you feeling comfortable in your own skin, being truly seen, having better boundaries + savoring what you have.* Meet the Showgirl Awakening Archetypes (the Diva, the Vixen, the Starlet, etc). Use them as a gauge of your current level of vitality, authenticity and confidence.* Discover why it has felt so scary to be seen, known + loved, even though those are the very things you’ve been longing for--and how to gently + incrementally begin practicing and even enjoying being apprehended.* The core reason why performing can feel bad (I don’t just mean on stage). Plus exactly how to make sure that it feels good.* Come to know how aiming directly for "sexy" can leave you feeling divorced from yourself, and how to naturally claim "sexy" in a way that feels good.* Discover the difference between "boom boom" + "drip drip" trauma and how each can keep you from expressing yourself fully, in obvious and sneaky ways...* Find out how to use the same elements that create a satisfying burlesque act, to create a satisfying life.* Learn how to avoid ever showing someone a disembodied boob ;)---What to Bring:*Pen and paper.*Water bottle.*Comfortable clothing you can move in. ---So, that’s it. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at kellita@showgirlawakening.com otherwise I hope to see you there.Love + Shimmies, Kellitacreator, showgirlawakening.com---ABOUT YOUR GUIDEKellita is a Performing + Teaching Artist, Mentor Coach and Burlesque Therapist.
