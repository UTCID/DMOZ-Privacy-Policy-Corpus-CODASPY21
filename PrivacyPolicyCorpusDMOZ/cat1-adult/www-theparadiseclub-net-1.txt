UPDATES *PLEASE CASH ONLY AT THE DOOR*
*WEATHER CANCELLATION POLICY*
With the winter coming,
we have changed our cancellation policy effective immediately.
The decision to cancel a party will be made by a majority rules concept.
Our staff is spread out through Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
If the majority rules we can go, WE WILL GO!.
If we need to cancel the decision will be made by noon, the day of the party.
Anyone who has pre-paid for that party will either be refunded or will be able to carry over to a future party.
Lets all keep in mind, snow removal and the driveway will have to be considered in the final decision.
BUT every attempt will be made to GO WITH THE PARTY, WE are not quitters!
