Statement for BookLocker.com
BookLocker.com has created this privacy statement in order
to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses
our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:
BookLocker.com.
You may visit BookLocker.com without identifying yourself, but if you'd
like to make a purchase you will need to register. Any information you
provide during the registration process, and the purchases you make, are
considered part of your BookLocker.com account. We use this information
to fill your orders, provide customer service assistance, and improve
the content of our site so that we may better serve you.
BookLocker.com believes that your personal information - including your
purchases, email and residential addresses, and credit card information
- belongs to you. We collect this information when you provide it and
we use it to develop our own marketing programs, but we do not rent or
sell information concerning our customers to third parties.
The only circumstance
where your information would be technically "sold" is if Booklocker.com
were bought by another entity. In that case, all the company's assets,
including its customer database, would belong to the other entity.
An author selling a book on Booklocker.com only sees the date, order number and royalty percentage owed to them of purchases related to his/her book. If the buyer provides the author with their order number directly, the author can trace that order number to a specific transaction in their author account. EXCEPTION: Authors retain all copyrights to their works. If a customer violates the copyright terms of a book (is discovered publishing/distributing copies without permission), Booklocker will provide the customer's contact information to the author so they can directly request the infringing activity be stopped.
We take all reasonable
precautions possible against hacking of our web server and customer database.
We update our software regularly and we have a dedicated SSL server to
protect your credit card and personal information. SSL encrypts all ordering
information so that it cannot be read in transit.
Because of the security
risks, we do
not store credit card numbers in our database or anywhere on our server.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and
to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you
and your shopping cart.
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart contents.
This site contains links to other sites. BookLocker.com is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices
of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us
