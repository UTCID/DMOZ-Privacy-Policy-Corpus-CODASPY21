Editorial Reviews
10/01/2015Gr 10 Up—A thorough (but flawed) look at Internet protection aimed squarely at female users. There is a battle to be fought, and the author intends to arm the female population with the critical information they need to protect their privacy. In her least objective moments, Blue, an investigative tech reporter and self-described agitator, posits that "you actually can post or share sexy pictures of yourself and stay in control." She also states that "filthy-rich celebrities are more able than the rest of us to hide things they consider private or embarrassing because they can afford to" and should therefore keep their social media privacy suggestions to themselves. The plethora of nude celebrity photo hacking scandals seems to contradict this assertion. References to companies as "greedy" and "douchey" are further examples of biased opinion presented as fact. Blue offers clear suggestions on how to avoid becoming an Internet victim, but her unwavering confidence in her own opinions and ardor for the topic make her advice seem heavy-handed at times, which may put off teens. VERDICT This informative but flawed book works best as a resource for victims in search of a staunch advocate or as an option for adults, who can better separate the opinions from the useful facts.—Cindy Wall, Southington Library & Museum, CT
