Rubber Allergy Information
Our rubber clothing is cut from latex sheeting made from natural rubber latex (NRL), this NRL is a vital ingredient found in more than 40,000 every day products and healthcare items, such as balloons, clothing elastic, adhesive tape, condoms, surgical gloves, toys, elasticated bandages and many more besides.
Although commonly used, the natural proteins found in NRL can cause some people to have an allergic reaction. If you are allergic to this protein, you may have experienced reactions to banana, kiwi fruit, avocado, chestnut, potato, tomato, cherry, peach, and various other plant foods.
This allergic reaction is very rare but we advise customers with a history of this hypersensitivity avoid rubber sheeting/clothing; it is therefore the customers responsibility to ensure they do not suffer from this allergy prior to purchasing our rubber clothing.
If you experience any itching, redness or swelling upon contact, remove garment and contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
