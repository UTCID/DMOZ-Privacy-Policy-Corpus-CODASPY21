(We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this website. All amended terms automatically take effect on the date set out in the posted Privacy Policy, unless otherwise specified.)
Types of information we collect and use
In this policy, “personal information” or “personal data” means information about an identifiable individual that is subject to protection under the law in the jurisdiction in which you reside. In some jurisdictions, “personal information” or “personal data” will not include business contact information.

If you choose to register with any of the Websites to receive updates from us, to manage your account and/or use our self-service portal, then you will be requested to provide contact information (name, address, telephone number, email address, a unique login name, and password).

We use this demographic information to understand your needs and interests and to provide you a more personalized experience on our site. The information is used by the group to process your orders, enable participation in promotions (subject to your marketing preferences), and so that we can provide our services to you.
If we speak to you over the phone, you may provide us with personal data during the call. Such calls may be recorded for training and quality purposes.

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or breach the privacy rights of others, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. To exercise any of these rights, please contact gdpr@regus.com. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.
Keeping your information secure
We do not guarantee or warrant the security of our servers nor can we guarantee that information you supply through the Website will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secured socket layer technology. Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in the future. Where we process personal information in connection with performing a contract or providing a service, or for a competition, we keep the information for 6 years (except for financial information which we keep for 10 years) from your last interaction with us. We keep recordings of telephone calls and CCTV recordings for relatively short periods of time, as determined in accordance with our internal compliance procedures implemented from time to time.
Business transitions
In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.
