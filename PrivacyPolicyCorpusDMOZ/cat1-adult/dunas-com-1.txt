"This is my second year in a workshop. I felt there were just enough folks in the class for the instructor to get to know the attendees and for the attendees to get to know one another. I have made lifetime friends in these workshops. I feel the number of days is good. I just wish the festival would be more days so I could fit in more seminars after the workshop." - Kim
"This workshop was so exceptional!! I want to do it again!! To learn from these two amazing photographers [Tim Griffith & Scott Frances] was the best opportunity I have had in photography! Hearing their thought processes about composition, light, gesture, color etc. has opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about my photography. I hesitated at the cost but it was well worth it!! I would consider a workshop again." - Lori
