We charge NO fees for unlimited and unrestricted access to our website's picture archives, free live guest chat rooms, profiles, and all other free Members-only services.
If access to pay live video chat rooms requires an additional fee, the amount of any such fee is prominently disclosed prior to entering the pay chat room.
Paid chat room fees are solely at the discretion and control of the performer and will be fully disclosed to You before You enter any paid chat room.
No charge or transfer will be made to Your credit card or related to Your alternative payment method
without Your authorization by accessing the Pay Per Minute areas on Your Membership account or authorizing a premium Membership.
A premium Membership is a Membership that enables You to access services beyond per minute chat or free Members-only services, such as video or Club Membership.
The amount and possible recurrence of all premium Membership fees will be clearly disclosed to You.
By entering the clearly marked Pay Per Minute areas, You authorize us to make a charge, or transfer related to your billing method, of the posted rate, as well as any taxes that may apply.
Credit card users and certain debit card users will be charged 2 US dollars or an amount equal to the first full minute, whichever is greater, upon entering this area.
This nominal amount is automatically refunded to You in the form of a credit to Your Account once You purchase any premium services.
For billing inquiries, or to request a detailed statement of Your usage, You may email supportteam@webcamassist.com.
You may also choose to add an additional amount of money by use of "Gold."
Gold is a site currency that You can send to a performer in addition to a performer's per minute chat rate.
One GOLD is equal to 1 US dollar.
The amount of Gold given will be added to any streaming charges incurred and billed in the same manner.
Adding Gold is completely voluntary and is not required.
There is no fee for basic Membership of our website.
However, a nominal onetime authorization may be applied to Your credit or debit card upon initial enrollment, which we use to confirm the integrity of Your account information.
[Note:
Federal legislation such as the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and communications Decency Act (CDA) may mandate such practices as documentary evidence of user age.]
This authorization is typically $2.00 USD, but may vary depending on your payment method or billing currency. The authorization may show on your statement for a few days, but it will expire within 7 days and then the entire amount of the authorization will be refunded to Your credit or debit card.
Some alternative billing methods do not involve this nominal credit card authorization.
In some situations, if You decide to enter a fee-based or premium area of the site, however, You must then upgrade to a full membership. At that time, we may apply a similar nominal charge not to exceed five dollars ($5.00 USD).
This nominal amount is automatically refunded to You in the form of a credit to Your litcams.com account, and is credited toward the cost of any premium services You purchase.
Premium Memberships have a published prevailing rate. These fees are prominently disclosed to You prior to Your authorization of the Membership charge and its recurrence.
Many premium Memberships are time based and therefore a recurring charge is incurred by the Member.
An authorization of a premium Membership provides You with the specified timeframe of access to premium services. An example of a specified timeframe is a 30 day recurring premium Membership.
Upon signing up for a premium Membership, You are provided 30 days of access to the premium services.
If You choose to cancel the recurrence of the premium Membership renewal, Your Membership will expire at the end of the initial 30 day period.
Premium Memberships are listed in Your My Account area of the website and cancellation can be facilitated from that page.
We set a daily spending limit for our Members. This daily limit is a rolling 12-hour limit of charges You may incur.
We set this limit in our sole discretion.
You can request an increase to Your daily limit by contacting supportteam@webcamassist.com.
You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, accumulate charges incurred during Your billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
This means that accumulated charges may appear on the statement You receive from Your bank, card issuer, or other payment source.
Further, You agree that we may delay obtaining authorization from Your bank, card issuer, or other payment source until submission of the accumulated charges, which delay will be chosen by us in our sole discretion.
You acknowledge that, if You want to see the components of accumulated charges, You may do so by emailing supportteam@webcamassist.com.
If You are paying dollar-based fees in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Your bank or financial institution may impose fees for currency exchange and for international transactions.
For example, Visa and MasterCard typically charge a 1% processing fee on international transactions and most card-issuing banks add their own small additional fees, generally a percentage of Your overall purchase price. Similar considerations apply when there is a difference between the currency in which fees are quoted on the website and the currency in which You make Your actual payment.
In some situations, we might be able to change your billing currency.
To inquire about this, contact supportteam@webcamassist.com.
If you pay for the Service using PayPal, due to the increased cost to us, then an additional charge of 4% of the purchase amount will be added to your bill. The Washington State sales tax on video and club Membership purchases is included in all published prices. No Washington State sales tax will be added to published prices on these purchases.
You are responsible for all charges associated with connecting to our website and all amounts owed to Your internet service provider.
You agree that all such charges incurred by You are entirely Your responsibility.
For example, depending on Your particular location and chosen internet service provider, You may be responsible for long distance charges and/or other communication surcharges.
Funds transferred to Your account, as well as discounts and promotional pricing associated with Your account, will expire as applicable, except where prohibited by applicable laws. We reserve the right to set the expiration date of these items in our sole discretion.
Rewards are issued to Members in our sole discretion.
Rewards have no cash value and cannot be traded or used as tender.
If we do not receive payment via your payment method for Your use of the Service, You agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. Each time You use the Service, You agree and reaffirm that we are authorized to charge or make a transfer related to your billing method.
If we do not receive the full amount of Your account balance within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month late charge may be added to Your bill and immediately become due and payable, in our sole discretion.
You shall be liable for all attorney fees and collection fees arising from our efforts to collect any past due and unpaid balance of Your account.
You agree to be billed for and to pay any outstanding balance in the event of cancellation or termination of Your account.
Unless You notify us of any discrepancies within thirty (30) days after they first appear on Your account statement, they will be deemed acceptable by You for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by Your card issuer or bank.
You release us and all our representatives from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy that is not reported to us within thirty (30) days of its publication.
WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE OUR FEES AND BILLING METHODS, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL FEES OR SEPARATE CHARGES FOR ONLINE AREAS, CONTENT, PREMIUM MEMBERSHIPS, OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY US OR OUR AFFILIATES.
WE MAY ALSO ELECT, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF BILLING CHARGES THROUGH POP-UPS, EMAIL, MEMBER INBOX ON SITE, U.S. MAIL TO THE ACCOUNT HOLDER, OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS DEEMED REASONABLE BY US.
If any such change is unacceptable to You, You may terminate Your Membership as provided below.
Your continued use of our website following the effective date of any such change shall constitute Your acceptance of any such change.
REFUND POLICY
All sales are final.
We have a "no refunds" policy.
In our sole discretion and in extraordinary circumstances, we may provide credits in the form of free time or provide discounts in the event You experience technical difficulties that You demonstrate to have made a sincere effort to resolve.
We do not provide cash refunds, unless we determine in our sole discretion that extraordinary circumstances apply.
Discount rates posted on the website can be changed in our sole discretion and without prior notice by us to You.
Any such discount will be based on the rates posted on the website at the time of purchase.
TERMINATION
We reserve the right to terminate Your Membership at any time for any reason in our sole discretion.
This includes but is not limited to we have the right to deny service for accounts and users which in our sole discretion are deemed to be fraudulent or otherwise high risk accounts.
We also reserve in our sole discretion the right to report to and cooperate with law enforcement with respect to any claims of potential fraud.
Please see our Privacy Policy for further information on this subject.
You also may terminate Your Membership at any time, subject to Your continuing duty to pay all charges incurred by You.
You agree this is Your sole remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with us, including but not limited to Your dissatisfaction with our Terms and Conditions, any Content available on our website, any amount or type of fees or charges, or our billing practices.
You can terminate Your Membership by delivering notice to our Customer Service Department by sending an email to supportteam@webcamassist.com.

In the event Your account is terminated or canceled, no refund (including but not limited to any Membership fees) will be granted and no online time or other credits will be credited to You or can be converted to other form of reimbursement.
