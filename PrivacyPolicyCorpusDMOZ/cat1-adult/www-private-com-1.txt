Information collection and use
PMG is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. PMG collects information from our users at several different points on our Site.
Registration
In order to use this Site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address) and unique identifiers (such as, username and password). We use this information to contact you with information about user’s account, about services on our Site for which user has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Site.
Profile
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. You can opt out of receiving these at any time by unsubscribing or contacting us by email at support@private.com
Cookies
This Site uses cookies to enable us to improve our services to you and to provide certain features that you may find useful. Cookies are used for various purposes like tracking your moment through the Site, again to improve your experience, keeping you logged in between visits etc.
Now for a little more information about cookies! A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
By setting a cookie on our Site, users would not have view the adult warning page or choose their preference of language, thereby saving time while on our Site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our Site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Site. For example, the user's language preference would not be saved. For more information about cookies and how to delete cookies being installed visit the following website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Maintaining security of your personal data
We take every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a user service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
If users have any questions about the security at our Site, users can send an email to support@private.com
Sharing your personal data
We only ever share your personal data with other companies if necessary for the operation of our Site. You will be subject to their company privacy policy. We shall now explain below a list of who we might share your data with. Whilst companies may change in the future, we will update this notice accordingly.
-	Billing Providers/ Authorised reseller agents/Third parties
If you sign up to our Site, your credit card or other billing data (credit card, email, first and last name, country, ZIP or post code) is processed by one of our payment processors; Epoch, Rocketgate, Centrobill or Webbilling.

We sometimes partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter, service announcements and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or the user may contact us by email at support@private.com to opt-out.
