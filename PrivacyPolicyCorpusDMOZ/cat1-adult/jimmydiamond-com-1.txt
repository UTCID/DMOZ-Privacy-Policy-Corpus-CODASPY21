III.       Personal
Information the COMPANY Collects
and How It Is Used
A.        The COMPANY collects information in different ways
from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the
network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information
primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and,
generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may
disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission
beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such
disclosure is required by law or other special cases (described below).
B.        Registration. Members are asked to provide certain personal
information when they sign up for our Services including name, address,
telephone number and the
type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal
information collected from Members during the registration process is used to
manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information
is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in
special circumstances. However, in instances where the COMPANY and a partner
jointly promote the Services, , may provide the partner certain personal
information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed
to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of
allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.
In this
instance, personal information will not be used by the partner for any other
purpose. The COMPANY may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles
from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the
total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail
below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell
advertisements that appear on the Services.
C.        COMPANY Partners and Sponsors. Some COMPANY products and services are offered to
Visitors and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide
Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need
to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be
notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to
use that particular service or feature. Additionally, many COMPANY, Members
have co-branded Personal Start Pages that are cosponsored by nonaffiliated partners. The COMPANY will share
nonidentifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not
personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded
products or services offered.
D.
Online Shopping.
1.         At some of our SITES, you can purchase products and
services or register to receive materials.
In many cases, you may be asked to
provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone
number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone
else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be
asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name,
address, and phone number. The COMPANY has no control over the third parties'
use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please
exercise care when doing so.
2.         If you order products directly from the COMPANY, we
will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do
not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary
to complete that order.
E.         Online
Advertisements.
The COMPANY
displays online advertisements. We share aggregated and non-identifying
information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration
process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these
advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and
non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance,
an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males
between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to
the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have
collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. The
COMPANY does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with
these advertisers.
F.         Responses to Email
Inquiries.
When Visitors
or Members send email inquiries to the COMPANY the return email address is used
to answer the email inquiry we receive. The COMPANY does not use the return
email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address
with any third party.
G.
Voluntary Customer Surveys.
1.         We may periodically conduct both business and
individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these
surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to
improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your
personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if
the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys
is voluntary.
2.         We take the information we receive from individuals
responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the
responses of other COMPANY customers to create broader, generic responses to
the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, interests, hobbies,
education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We
then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to
you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally
identifying information may be shared with third parties.
3.         We also use our Visitors' and Members' information
for market research data purposes.
For example, we may use your information in
order to find ways to improve sales to a group of other users, to increase you
or other users (Members?) experience according to your interests, or to
formulate statistical models to accomplish such goals through surveys or contests.
H.        Other Internet Data.
The COMPANY also collects IP addresses, referral
URLs, browser preferences, the user's registration forms, surveys, and
communications transmitted through SITE'S applications in order to collect
information from End-Users.
This information is used internally for the
purposes of providing additional personalized services to our Members and to
track how users come to be referred to our SITES for the purpose of
compensating our affiliates, advertisers, and other marketing entities.
This
information may be disclosed to third-parties.
If we choose to disclose
information to third-parties, this information shall consist of non-specific
information regarding SITE traffic and statistics.
The COMPANY never discloses
any customer specific information to third parties unless it is reasonable to
believe that doing so is required by law, a binding contract, a Court Order, or
other state, local, or administrative regulation.
I.          Special
Cases.
It is the COMPANY's policy not to
use or share the personal information about Visitors of Members in ways
unrelated to those described above without also providing you an opportunity to
opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, the COMPANY may
disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information
regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our
Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is
reasonable to do so, including:
1.         To satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such
information;
2.         To disclose information that is necessary to
identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating
our Acceptable Use Policy http://jimmydiamond.com/legal/terms_and_conditions.html  or
other user policies;
3.         To
operate the Services properly;
4.         To
protect the COMPANY and our Members;
5.         We
will cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party litigants, and
others seeking information about our end users to the extent required by
applicable law.
Examples of such cooperation include compliance with discovery
requests, subpoenas, court orders, and writs.
J.         "Cookies"
and How the COMPANY Uses Them.
A "cookie"
is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit
certain Web sites. The COMPANY may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes
track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services
we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. We may use a cookie
to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services to
you. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer
information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-COMPANY Web sites
where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required
to accept cookies.
Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We
do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for
information collected through them.
K.        Company Email.
The COMPANY periodically sends mass email to its
users.
The COMPANY has an Opt-in Policy and an Opt-out Policy for unsolicited
email.
The only way for the user's email address to be added to our email list
is for the user to provide this information to us and then state that the user
wishes to be added to our email list either explicitly or by acquiescing to the
conditions of an offer.
Every email we send to you will have an unsubscribe link
at the bottom.
These unsubscribe links, when clicked, will automatically
remove the customer's email address from our database without any additional
action on the user's part.
The COMPANY takes all reasonable steps in order to
adhere with this Policy, but the COMPANY is not responsible for occasional
technical malfunctions which may result in additional unwanted emails being
sent.
Should this occur, the user is instructed to direct an inquiry to the
COMPANY's Customer Service email address, which is available here .
IV.       Our
Commitment to Children's Protection.
A.        Our SITES are designed for adults, but not for use
by anyone under the age of 18.
In light of that fact, the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act of 1998 is not applicable to this SITE.
B.        We
have no Web pages designed for younger users. We make every effort to ensure
that our Web sites contain adequate warnings to make their content obvious and
to warn users under the age of 18 that they are not welcome to view our SITES,
we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision of their
children's internet use.
Nevertheless, we will take any steps possible to
discourage those under the age of 18 from visiting our Web sites. For further
information about tips, tools, age-appropriate, or kid-friendly Web sites and
how to report online trouble, please visit www.getnetwise.org.
V.        Public
Forums and External Sites.
A.        Please remember that any information you may
disclose in our Member             Directory,
or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public
information.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal          information
in these public areas.
B.        The SITE may contain links to other sites. Please be
aware that we are not             responsible
for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users    to
be aware that when they leave our SITE they should read the privacy             statements
of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.
VI.       The
COMPANY's Commitment to Data Security.
Services and Web
sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,
and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort
to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot
guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from
illegally obtaining this information.
We take all reasonable measures to
prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of
cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100%
breach-proof.
You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they
occur despite our reasonable security measures.
VII.      How
to Access or Modify Your Information.
The COMPANY
offers Members the opportunity to access or modify information provided during
registration.
