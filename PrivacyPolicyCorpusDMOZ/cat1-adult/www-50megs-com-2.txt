These Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Statement, the Acceptable Use Guidelines and any material details or terms related to your Service and account that are provided to you in your registration process (including any billing policies), all of which are referred to collectively as the “Rules,” govern your use of the Services.
You cannot have an account with us unless you have agreed to the Rules by completing the registration process for, or by using, the Services, and each use of the Service constitutes your reaffirmation of your acceptance of the Rules.
Please review the most current Rules at the website for the particular brand of your Services (with respect to a particular Service, the “Site”) prior to accessing the Services.
The Services are only available to residents of the United States and Canada unless otherwise specified.

Early Termination Fee. Your Service may include a minimum term commitment (see your service plan description). Your minimum term begins on your the billing start date. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU TERMINATE (OR TAKE AN ACTION THAT CAUSES TERMINATION OF) YOUR SERVICE BEFORE SATISFYING THE MINIMUM TERM COMMITMENT UNDER YOUR PLAN, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY UNITED ONLINE WEB SERVICES UPON DISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE A TERMINATION FEE AS SET FORTH IN YOUR PLAN DESCRIPTION (THE "EARLY TERMINATION FEE").
