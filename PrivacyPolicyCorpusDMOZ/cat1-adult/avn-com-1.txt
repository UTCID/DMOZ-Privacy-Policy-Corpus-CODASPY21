We sometimes use this data to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your business with us. We sometimes use the non-unique user specific data that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your online activities. We also may use this data to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you programs, services or products. We may disclose unique user specific data in response to legal obligations, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

Although we take appropriate steps to protect against unauthorized disclosures of data, we cannot guarantee you that unique user specific data that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Occasionally we may combine data we acquire online with other records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.
