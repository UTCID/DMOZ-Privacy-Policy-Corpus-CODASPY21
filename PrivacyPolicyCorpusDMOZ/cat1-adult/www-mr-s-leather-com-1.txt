Shipping FAQ
Plan Early for the Holidays!
With so many people shopping from home, delivery systems will face an unprecedented challenge this year. We cannot guarantee delivery times, so if an order is something you wish to have for Christmas or any other specific date, please don’t wait until the last minute!
For Christmas deliveries, we recommend you place your order by December 14th. Past the 14th, we recommend that you choose 3-Day, 2-Day, or 1-Day service at checkout.
Important note: Saturday and Sunday are not included in delivery times! For example, orders placed on a Thursday with 2-Day service will arrive on Monday.
In addition to placing time-sensitive orders by the 14th, we also recommend the following deadlines:
Between December 14th and 16th, choose 3-Day service
Between December 17th and 18th, choose 2-Day Service
Between December 19th and 21st, choose 1-Day Service
Storefront Pickup is Available Daily from 12pm to 6pm:
The store is unfortunately not open for shopping, but you are welcome to come by and pick up your online order.
When placing your order, please choose California as the state for your Shipping Address, and you’ll then see “Will Call” as a free shipping option.
We will text you once your order is ready for pickup, so please make sure we have your cell phone number to reach you at.
For same-day pickup, please have your order in to us by 5pm.
There are two parking spots blocked for pickup customers on the corner (don’t let the red No Stopping sign deter you).
We are happy to answer any questions you have at the front, and purchases can be made also in person.
Limited staff on hand, so super helpful if you know in advance what items you might be interested in.
And Yes, our Brown Bottle Leather Strippers are available at the door.
Don’t forget your mask!

When will my order ship?
Due to a high volume of orders, and navigating with a smaller staff, we require some extra time to process and ship orders.   You may not receive tracking info for a few days.  Please be patient and we'll work on getting your gear out as quickly as we can.  Please limit emails to critical order related questions. Unfortunately we aren't able to field general questions at this time. Thank you for understanding.  Once we're back up and running we'll be more than happy to get to all of your questions.
Our shipping deadline is 12PM/Noon, Monday through Friday. Most orders placed before that time will ship within 24 to 48 hours. If you placed an order with a custom item, our customer service team will reach out to discuss shipping timelines. Saturday and Sunday are not considered Business Days and as such are not factored into the Delivery Timeframe. Orders placed after 12PM/Noon on Friday or over the weekend will ship on Monday (Tuesday if Monday is a Holiday).We will be sure your order arrives within the desired Delivery Timeframe chosen upon checkout! Check out our available shipping methods in the list below.

Which companies do you ship with?
UPS is our primary carrier; they provide excellent tracking of your package, guaranteed delivery dates, and a transit time of 1 - 5 business days from the date of shipping, depending on your distance from San Francisco.
USPS - US Postal Service - is required for PO Boxes, US Territories, APO/Military addresses, and non-expedited shipments to Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Shipments via US Post usually take between 2 - 5 days from date of shipping for delivery but do not have a guaranteed delivery time.
The map above represents shipping times in business days using UPS Ground delivery once your package has left our store.

How fast can I get my order? Is rush service available?
For domestic US shipments we offer UPS 1-Business Day & UPS 2-Business Day service (including major metropolitan areas of Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico).
Rush service cannot be gauranteed for for APO/Military, PO Boxes, or US Territories.
If you would like a quote for shipping charges, please select your items and proceed to the checkout page. Once you have entered your state and zip code in the shipping fields you can see your calculated shipping rate in the Shipping Method menu.

Do you ship orders internationally?
At this time International Post isn't available. We have been experiencing issues with that service around the globe and until it resolves we will not be utilizing that method.  We will instead be shipping all international packages using UPS International.
We ship orders all over the world, every day, and offer the following carrier options.
UPS International: A door-to-door carrier service that usually delivers your package between 2-6 business days from date of shipping. We highly recommend this service to most countries. It is quick, highly reliable and offers tracking along the way.
International Post via Local Carrier: An international mail service delivered to you by your local postal carrier with an average transit time of 7-14 days from date of shipping. This service is required for International Post Office and Parcel Locker deliveries.
Back To Top
What is the cost of shipping internationally?
For a limited time we're taking $19 off all international shipments.
Shipping fees are dependent on which country the order is shipped to. While most orders have a flat rate shipping fee, there are items that have a calculated rate due to being oversize or heavyweight.
To find out the flat rate shipping costs to your country, click the link below:
International Shipping Fees
International Duties and Taxes:International orders are subject to import duties and/or taxes for countries that require them. The fees are the responsibility of the customer/receiver to remit payment. Failure to pay these fees may result in your package being held by Customs. Packages returned for such reasons will incur a secondary shipping fee if reshipped. Although it is rare, should customs officials seize an item, Mr. S Leather cannot be held responsible.
While we maintain a high level of discretion for all of our orders, International Post packages require itemized documentation on the exterior of the package. UPS International orders have digital customs documentation that cannot be read without a computer scanner.

How will my order be packed and shipped?
All packages are shipped in plain brown boxes or plain padded envelopes and contain the following return address:
MSL 385 8th Street San Francisco, CA 94103
Back To Top
Will I be able to track my order status and my package?
Customers who place orders under an online account can login to the website at any time to see its current status. Guests will receive email notifications at time of ordering and when the order is shipped. At the end of every business day, we send out tracking information to the email address you provided with your order. Please ensure we are white-listed through your email service provider. If you do not receive an email (due to spam blockers, etc.), please let us know and we will be happy to update you on your order status.
