What personally identifiable information is collected from you
The Houseboi.com Classifieds collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address.
The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required.
This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the ad posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it.
Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Houseboi.com - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the Houseboi.com Classifieds.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place ads or take advantage of the other features of the Houseboi.com Classifieds.
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
Every page within the Houseboi.com Classifieds includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current.
You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "My Profile" link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in.
Once you have logged onto the system during a given session, wherever you go on the Houseboi.com Classifieds, your information will stay with you.

The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information
Other than the administrator of the Houseboi.com Classifieds or other authorized personnel of Houseboi.com, you are the only person who has access to your personal information.
Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Houseboi.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Houseboi.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

What else you should know about your online privacy
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in ads that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
