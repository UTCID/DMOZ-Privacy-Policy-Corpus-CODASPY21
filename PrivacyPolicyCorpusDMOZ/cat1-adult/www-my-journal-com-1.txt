themselves in complete anonymity. The only information made public about you is the
information you choose to reveal about yourself.
What about registration information?
My-Journal.com will never share your registration information with any other organization
or website. It is for use on this website alone. The only pieces of registration
information we will make public are your user name, which may be any fictitious name you
choose, your gender, sexuality and approximate age.
What about my email address?
My-Journal.com will NEVER reveal your email address unless YOU choose to do
so. The only place it may appear is in the Forum section where YOU MAY CHOOSE to reveal
it in your personal profile. If you do not make this choice, your email address will
remain completely private.
My-Journal.com may send you occasional updates about the website to your email address.
If or when we do, we will make sure you have a way to refuse future mailings if you do not want
to receive them.
