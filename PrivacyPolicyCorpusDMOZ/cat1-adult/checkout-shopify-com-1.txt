<h2>3. Explaining the legal bases we rely on.</h2>
<p>The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:</p>
<p>Consent -</p>
<p>In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent.</p>
<p>e.g. when you tick a box to receive email newsletters.</p>
<p>When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.</p>
<p>Contractual obligations -</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.</p>
<p>e.g. if you order an item from us for home delivery, we’ll collect your address details to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our courier.</p>
<p>Legal compliance -</p>
<p>If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.</p>
<p>e.g. we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting the Partnership to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Legitimate interest -</p>
<p>In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.</p>
<p>e.g. we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers, if you have opted in for such contact.</p>
<p>We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products/services.</p>
<h2>4. When do we collect your personal data?</h2>
<p>When you visit our websites, and use your account to buy products and services, or redeem vouchers from us on the phone, in our studio or online. <br />When you make an online purchase and check out as a guest (in which case we just collect transaction-based data). <br />When you create an account with us. <br />When you purchase a product or service in store or by phone but don’t have (or don’t use) an account. <br />When you contact us by any means with queries, complaints etc. <br />When you enter prize draws or competitions. <br />When you book any kind of appointment with us or book to attend an event, e.g. a Sample Sale appointment. <br />When you choose to complete any surveys we send you. <br />When you fill in any forms. For example, if an accident happens in store, we may collect your personal data. <br />When you’ve given a third party permission to share with us the information they hold about you.</p>
<h2>5. What sort of personal data do we collect?</h2>
<p>If you have an online account with us: your name, billing/delivery address, orders and receipts, email and telephone number. For your security, we’ll also keep an encrypted record of your login password.</p>
<p>Details of your interactions with us in our studio or online.</p>
<p>e.g. we collect notes from our conversations with you at appointments</p>
<p>We’ll only ask for and use your personal data collected for recommending items of interest and to tailor your shopping experience with us. Of course, it’s always your choice whether you share such details with us. <br />Payment card information. <br />Your comments and product reviews.</p>
<h2>6. How and why do we use your personal data?</h2>
<p>We want to give you the best possible customer experience.</p>
<p>Of course, if you wish to change how we use your data, you’ll find details in the ‘What are my rights?’ section below.</p>
<p>Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide some services you’ve asked for.</p>
<p>e.g. if you’ve asked us to let you know when an item comes back into stock, we can’t do that if you’ve withdrawn your general consent to hear from us.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ll use your personal data and why:</p>
<p>To process any orders that you make by using our website or in store. If we don’t collect your personal data during checkout, we won’t be able to process your order and comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>e.g. your details will need to be passed to our third party Payment Gateway supplier, SagePay, so they can process your order payment, and we may keep your details for a reasonable period afterwards in order to fulfil any contractual obligations such as refunds, guarantees and so on.</p>
<p>To respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the information you sent enables us to respond. We may also keep a record of these to inform any future communication with us and to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We do this on the basis of our contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate interests in providing you with the best service and understanding how we can improve our service based on your experience.</p>
<p>To protect our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. This includes using your personal data to maintain, update and safeguard your account. We’ll also monitor your browsing activity with us to quickly identify and resolve any problems and protect the integrity of our website. We’ll do all of this as part of our legitimate interest. <br /> e.g. by checking your password when you login and using automated monitoring of IP addresses to identify possible fraudulent logins from unexpected locations.</p>
<p>To process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. This also helps to protect our customers from fraud. <br />If we discover any criminal activity or alleged criminal activity through our use of fraud monitoring and suspicious transaction monitoring, we will process this data for the purposes of preventing or detecting unlawful acts. We aim to protect the individuals we interact with from criminal activities.</p>
<p>With your consent, we will use your personal data, to keep you informed by email, web, text, and telephone about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts, promotions, events, competitions and so on.</p>

For example, updates to this Privacy Notice, product recall notices, and legally required information relating to your orders. These service messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. If we do not use your personal data for these purposes, we would be unable to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>To display the most interesting content to you on our website, we’ll use data we hold about your favourite brands or products and so on. We do so on the basis of your consent for our website to place cookies or similar technology on your device.</p>

<p>To send you survey and feedback requests to help improve our services. These messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. We have a legitimate interest to do so as this helps make our products or services more relevant to you.</p>
