The following Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Websites.
Read these terms carefully before you ("You") accept these Terms by: (a) placing an order through GameLink
or (b) otherwise using the Websites.
Additionally, the Websites may themselves contain additional terms, codes of conduct or guidelines that govern use of those websites, including without limitation, particular features or offers (for example, free trials, sweepstakes or chat areas).
In the event that any of the Terms contained herein conflict with any additional terms contained within any Website, then these Terms shall control.
Your use of the Websites constitutes Your Agreement to the Terms and any additional terms.
The Terms are entered into by and between GameLink and You.
Any reference herein to GameLink
shall be deemed to refer to GameLink and/or the Websites, as applicable under the circumstances.
The products offered for sale or rent and other on-line resources accessible via the Websites, are provided to You, subject to these Terms.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Terms will govern Your use of any new features that augment or enhance the Websites.
GameLink, and any third-party providers of content to the Websites, may make improvements and/or changes to the Websites including the products, programs, services and prices that are offered or described on the Websites, at any time, without prior notice.
In addition, GameLink does not warrant that the products offered on the Websites are available to be shipped to all customers or that product descriptions or other content of the Websites is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
If a product offered on the Websites is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return the product in unused condition.
You acknowledge that the Websites contain sexually oriented adult material intended for individuals 18 years of age or older and of legal age to view sexually explicit material as determined by the local and national laws of the region in which You reside.
You agree not to enter the Websites if you are not 18 years of age or older, if sexually oriented adult material offends you, or if you are accessing the Websites from any community or country where adult material is specifically prohibited by law.
2. Modification to Terms of Use

10. Privacy Policy
GameLink respects
Your desire for privacy. GameLink's Privacy Policy can be found at here.
By using the Websites, You are consenting to the processing of Your data by GameLink and consenting to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If we decide to make any significant change to that policy, we will post the revised policy prominently on the Websites or otherwise bring it to Your attention, so that You are always aware of what we do with Your information.
11. Site Security
You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Websites, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which You are not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Websites, overloading, "flooding," "spamming," "mailbombing" or "crashing;" (d) sending unsolicited email, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; or (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting.
Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
GameLink will investigate occurrences that may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enf-rcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in such violations.
You agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Websites or any activity being conducted on the Websites.
You agree, further, not to use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Websites other than the search engine and search agents available from GameLink on the Websites and other than generally available third party web browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer).
12. Termination of Use
GameLink, in its sole discretion, may terminate Your password, Your account, Your use of any of the on-line resources available on the Websites, and remove and discard any Content on the Websites, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if GameLink believes that You have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms.
Any termination of Your access to the Websites under any provision of the Terms may be effected without prior notice, and GameLink may immediately de-activate or delete Your account and all related information and files in Your account and/or bar any further access to such files or to the Websites.
Further, GameLink will not be liable to You or any third-party for any termination or suspension of Your Account or Your access to the Websites.
13. General Information
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and GameLink and govern Your use of the Websites, superseding any prior agreements between You and GameLink (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms).
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use other GameLink services, third-party content or third-party software. You must not assign or otherwise transfer either the Terms or any right granted hereunder.
Any breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to GameLink for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, GameLink will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs.
You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if GameLink seeks such an injunction.
Pennsylvania law and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms.
No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction apply.
You and GameLink agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
GameLink controls and operates the Websites from its headquarters in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States of America, and makes no representation that this Content is appropriate or available for use in other locations. If You use the Websites from other locations, You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws including but not limited to the export and import regulations of other countries.
The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of technology originating in the United States.
This includes the electronic transmission of information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals.
You agree to abide by these laws and their regulations including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Act and the Arms Export Control Act and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the Website to either a foreign national or a foreign destination in violation of such laws.
The failure of GameLink to exercise or enf-rce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full f-rce and effect.
REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.
The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
These Terms represent the entire understanding relating to the use of the Websites and prevail over any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting, or additional, communications.
