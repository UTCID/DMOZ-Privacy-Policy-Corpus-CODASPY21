Privacy Policy
Last modified date: September 25, 2020
1. Introduction
Sheboy provides an online social networking platform (the "Platform”) designed to enable consenting adults to express themselves via streaming video and chat. We are NOT in the business of producing cam broadcasts, we are in the business of providing a platform for individuals to access (each, a "Sheboy Member”) and share with other Sheboy Members live interactive video and audio content which may be, at the Sheboy Member’s discretion, of an adult nature.
Your privacy and security are of paramount importance to us when you choose to use our service. Sheboy is committed to protecting the data you share with us.
This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how Sheboy processes information collected through use of our website and platform that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual ("Personal Data”).
For the purposes of this Policy, Sheboy defines these terms:
"Guest” as someone who visits our front-end website (https://www.sheboy.com/) to observe cam shows for free and without any registration,
"Sheboy Member” as someone who registered an account with Sheboy,
"Independent Broadcaster” as a Sheboy Member with whom Sheboy has an established relationship and who has decided to provide Sheboy with Entrepreneurial Generated Content ("EGC”) by broadcasting webcam shows,
"Earners” are Independent Broadcasters who have selected the option to earn tokens for their performances on Sheboy.
Any user’s information found on Sheboy’s Platform is treated as confidential. All data is stored securely and is accessed by authorized personnel only. Sheboy implements and maintains appropriate technical, security and organizational measures to protect all its users’ Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and use, and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft or disclosure.
2. Collection and use
2.1 General
The following sections cover how we collect and process data for each of the four user groups defined above (Guests, Sheboy Members, Independent Broadcasters and Earners), including which pieces of data we collect and use for publication purposes, customer relations and email notifications.
2.2 Data from website guests
If you are a Guest to our website only, then this section is relevant for you.
When you visit Sheboy as a Guest, we will not ask you for any Personal Data.
However, Sheboy may collect, record, aggregate and analyze information of ALL visitors to its website, and we use analytics tracking systems such as Google Analytics to do this. Sheboy gathers data about visits to the website, including the numbers of visitors, geo-location data, length of time spent on the site, page view activity and hyperlinks clicked, where visitors have come from and what operating system is being used. We may record information from your web browser, your IP address and we use cookies to do so.
Although such information is not personally identifiable, we use your IP address to determine your Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity.
2.3 Data from Sheboy Members, Independent Broadcasters and Earners
In order to provide additional services to its Users, Sheboy must collect more data from them, some of which is Personal Data.
If you register an account, the data we collect includes your chosen "username” and email address.
This information is used by Sheboy to identify you and provide you with support, services, mailings, sales and marketing actions, billing and to meet contractual obligations.
If you choose to fill out an optional profile to share information about yourself with Sheboy and our community of Users, the Special Category of Personal Data we collect may include your ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, your profile picture and your biography.
We will seek your explicit consent to process Special Category of Personal Data, collected by Sheboy or volunteered by you. Kindly note that any consent will be entirely voluntary. However, if you do not grant the requested consent to the processing of your Personal Data, the use of this website as anything other than a "Viewer” may not be possible.
If you are an "Independent Broadcaster”, you may be asked to create a personal profile to include a name or alias you prefer to use, an email address, profile pictures, gender, date of birth, relationship status, your interests and hobbies, ethnicity and sexual orientation. We will ask you for this information in order to enable and monitor your use of our site platform and services. We will also retain snapshots of your broadcast video stream you created, and we will use that to assist us with verifying your age and to comply with law. Also, in order to comply with age verification laws and regulations, we will ask your consent to process your name, age, aliases, maiden names, nicknames, and any stage or professional names you may have used in the past or are currently using.
In the event you become an Earner, or otherwise choose to transact the purchase of goods and services through the site, one or more of our payment processors may collect billing information from you to facilitate your purchase from us. Such information may include a credit card number, its expiration date, and a billing address. WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR FINANCIAL DATA, WHICH IS COLLECTED BY OUR PAYMENT PROCESSORS. Financial data that is collected by our payment processor will only be used as necessary to initiate and complete any orders placed by your account. Please see our section on Payment Service Providers for more information.
Credit card purchases on Sheboy are processed via industry standard encryption through third-party processors, and these processors will use your information only for the purpose of processing your order. The financial data you share with our processors is considered private information and will not be shared with us, or with third parties, except with your authorization and as necessary to carry out orders placed by you and with your understanding that such transaction(s) may be subject to the rules and policies of such third parties.
If there is a dispute concerning your credit card purchase, Sheboy’s customer service department may receive from the relevant payment processor a truncated version of your credit card number in order to identify your purchase and to further assist or resolve the issue. We would then have in our possession a partial card number, which we would use for the proper administration of our payment services.
2.4 Data for customer relations
To properly manage our relationship with you and provide the best support and customer services, we may use your contact information including your name, your contact details, and any information found in prior communications between us. We will also keep records of our discussions so that we can follow up as needed, and to promote our products and services to you that may help address any service issues.
2.5 Data for email notifications
When you create an account on Sheboy, we may need to use your email address to notify you of important changes to your account, such as updates to Privacy Policy or Password reset requests.
If you consent to receive emails such as newsletters, product information or special offers and sales, we may use the Personal Data provided in your profile, your user group level, and purchase history order to tailor content and messages to your interest(s) and account type.
2.6 Publications, chat and video communications
If you post information on our site’s platform for the purpose of publishing it we may, with your consent, process that information in the course of administering our website and services. For example, we may, with your consent, share information about languages you’ve indicated you speak so that users looking to communicate in that same language can find you more easily.
Please bear in mind that the Sheboy website features of interactive video and chat services make it possible for you to communicate identifying information about yourself to other users who are viewing a live video stream from your device. This information is given directly to those users viewing the live video stream, and not to us. We cannot be responsible for the privacy of Personal Data that you communicate through video chat to users who are viewing your live video stream. Do not share Personal Data via live video streaming to other users of our Platform if you wish to maintain your privacy!
Sheboy Members should be aware that making use of chat or any other means of communication via our Platform could result in disclosing information that could make you personally identifiable to us or other users or Sheboy Members. The security and privacy protection implemented on our Platform does not cover this type of transfer or disclosure of personal information. All users of our Platform are solely responsible for the content of their messaging and any consequent disclosure of Personal Data.  It is every user’s responsibility to ensure that collection and processing of data is done in accordance with applicable law. We will not process Personal Data of our users disclosed in this fashion or by other means than instructed by its users via appropriate consents, as required by contract or law or as necessary to the functionality of the Site. Please, do NOT share anyone else’s Personal Data over the Sheboy Platform.
2.7 Legal claims and management of risk
We may process any of your Personal Data identified in this Policy where it is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, either in or out of court, or to hire professional advice for the protection of our business against risk and to assert our legal rights, your legal rights and the legal rights of others.
3. Sharing of personal data
3.1 General
The following sections tell you when and to whom Sheboy will disclose your Personal Data.
3.2 Legal and vital interests

3.3 Our companies
In order to accomplish the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, and on the legal bases set out herein, Sheboy may share your Personal Data with its group of companies and affiliated companies, including sister companies and so-called "white label” companies, and other subsidiaries of its holding company. For an up to date listing of
Sheboy`s affiliated websites, please contact "support@pinklabel.com".
3.4 Affiliate partners
Sheboy has an Affiliate Program which allows partners ("Affiliates”) to earn revenue by promoting Sheboy. These promotions may involve embedding profile images, live streams, chat rooms, and links to profiles on Affiliate’s websites as a means to drive traffic to Sheboy and promote our Broadcasters.
We may disclose your publicly available Personal Data, such as your profile information, profile image and live stream to our business partners and Affiliates.
We may also pass information relating to your privacy settings as is reasonably necessary for the uploading, sharing and viewing of adult content, including sexually explicit images you may have added. This is also done to ensure that Affiliates who may be promoting Independent Broadcasters are respecting the privacy settings of the individual, such as blocked countries.
We do not share your email, name, contact or other personally identifiable information with any of these Affiliates: poringa.net and jizz.xxx.
3.5 Payment services providers
We will share transaction data with our payment services providers only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments and handling complaints and questions. For more information about our payment processors privacy policies and practices, visit their website: Epoch Payment Solutions, Segpay Corp., DialXS.
3.6 3rd party providers of goods/services
A Service Provider (SP) provides organizations with consulting, legal, real estate, communications, storage, processing, etc. Although a service provider can be an organizational sub-unit, it is usually a third party or outsourced supplier, including financial service providers (banks or payment processors), telecommunications service providers, application service providers, storage service providers, Internet Service Providers ("ISP”), etc.
We may disclose some of your Personal Data (but none of the categories of special personal data) to one or more of our third party suppliers of services (for example to the banks in order to pay your earnings from your broadcasts) so that they can accomplish their duty to give you their best possible service.
3.7 Our legal obligation to disclose personal data
We will reveal a User’s Personal Data without prior permission when we have reason to believe that the disclosure of this information is required to establish the identity of, to contact or to initiate legal proceedings against, a person or persons who are suspected of infringing rights or property belonging to Sheboy or to others who could be harmed by the User’s activities. We are permitted to disclose personal information when we have good reason to believe that this is legally required.
Government authorities may, without your consent (or our consent), communicate information to other authorities, including relevant police if there is reasonable cause to believe that a criminal or penal offense has been committed or is about to be committed.
4. Special categories of personal data
Special Categories of Personal Data are defined as Personal Data revealing:
racial or ethnic origin
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs
trade union membership
biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person
data concerning health
data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation
If you choose to fill out an optional profile to share information about yourself with Sheboy and our community of Users, the Special Category of Personal Data we collect may include your ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, your profile picture and your biography.
Should you consent to such use, and never without your consent, this information is used by Sheboy to identify you and provide you with the best possible user experience, support, and services. For instance, helping you find cams and users who share the same interests, identifying you to other users, and preventing advertisers from showing you content you are not interested in. We also use this Personal Data to improve our marketing messages and campaigns to be relevant to your interest and experiences.
While users often share other types of Special Categories of Personal Data in personal biographies and profiles, such as political opinions or philosophical beliefs, Sheboy does not use this information for any purpose but retains it for you as part of our website services. You are of course free to edit, modify, delete and share your own personal information in your profiles, as long as it is compliant with law and our Terms of Service.
5. International transfers of personal data
5.1 Operations
The Sheboy platform is supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other information technologies including 3rd party service providers. Some of these services may come from jurisdictions other than your own, and those countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection. We have taken strict measures to protect your Personal Data; in particular, we rely on your explicit consent and security and confidentiality of your Personal Data in binding corporate rules and contractual protections. We are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to be able to provide the requested service to you.
5.2 Acknowledgement
You acknowledge that Personal Data you submit for publication or broadcast using our platform services may be available via the Internet, worldwide, and we cannot prevent the use or misuse of such Personal Data by others.
6. Retention and deletion
Sheboy will not retain data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. Sheboy’s users have control over the purpose for collecting data, and the duration for which the Personal Data may be kept. Users with an active account (Sheboy Members) will therefore have the responsibility to delete data when required. When a Sheboy Member’s account is terminated or expired, all Personal Data collected through the platform will be deleted, as required by applicable law, with the exception that we may retain your Personal Data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
