experience of the Site by monitoring and evaluating how the Site is used and
interacted with.
b) We may

coming from and to evaluate the success of any promotions or work done which
was intended to increase traffic.

limited to the types of pages visited and how frequent, the photos and videos
downloaded or viewed, forum posts, messages to us or other users, length of

Protection
and Use of Confidential and Private Information
During
the Registration Process we request various forms of Private information such
as Name, Email Address, Age (over 18). This information is always treated as
confidential and is never shared with other any other users on the Site, nor is
any information available to persons outside the immediate group of trusted
employees or agents operating the Site. Such trusted employees or agents will
only very rarely ever need to access such Information, for reasons in
accordance with this Privacy Policy or to the extent required by law, and such
access would always be made under strictly confidential conditions.
a) No
Private Information will ever be utilised for direct marketing or profit
purposes by selling, exchanging or through agreement with any unauthorised 3rd
party and we would always be sure to receive such User’s authorisation and
confirmation before using any Private Information for these purposes.
b)
Private Information may, however, be collated in order to collect and store
statistics or overall data related to the use of the Site and to our Registered
Users (eg We may wish to measure how many users are based in a certain country
or calculate the average age of all the users on the site). As well as being
used for our own strategic purposes, such data may be shared or exchanged with
3rd parties, however it will always be presented in a way that individual users
are not identifiable and any possibly exploitable personal information is not
displayed.
c) We
reserve the right to notify any relevant Protective or Governmental authorities
(eg Police) using any provided Private Information if we suspect or determine,
in our own discretion, that a User may have or there is a significant risk that
a User has, engaged in actions relating to or in the course of using the Site
or associated services that may be illegal or potentially harmful to themselves
or others. We will always disclose any Private Information required to any
Relevant Protective Authority when requested to do so to the extent required by
law.
d) We
will take all reasonable technical and organisational precautions to protect
against the loss, misuse or alteration of any of the Personal Information we
gather through the Site and we will only ever store Private Information that we
gather on our secure (Password & Firewall-Protected) Servers. Note however;
Data transmission over the web is inherently insecure so we can never
completely guarantee the security of any data sent to our Servers.
e) You
are responsible for keeping your password and User Account details
confidential. Only when signing in to the Site will we ever request your
password from you and all Users' passwords are stored on our Servers in a
securely-encrypted and indecipherable format.
Information
posted on the Site
We can in
no way prevent the use or misuse of any Information which is posted, submitted
or displayed by our Users in the course of using or visiting the Site and are
under no obligation to remove any personal or confidential data which may be
shared or published by Users. We will where possible however try to remove any
content displayed in relation to the Site that might be considered confidential
or private where such information is reported to us.
Cookies
Policy
A cookie
is information which is sent to your web browser from our server and is stored
there - either for the duration only of your visit to the Site (using
"Session Cookies") or for a fixed period of time (using
"Persistent Cookies") - in order to send communication and information
from your browser to our Server, or indeed to the server of any other 3rd party
who may send you cookies. Such communication between Browser and Server enables
a web server to identify, analyse, track or otherwise make use of certain data
from your web browser.
a) We use
a Session Cookie whenever you visit the site in order to properly identify you
as you move throughout the site. More specifically, this Session Cookie is used
so that you are recognised as 'Logged in' as you navigate from page to page and
so do not have to log in each time you visit a new page. Session Cookies are
always deleted as soon as you close your web browser.
b) We may
also need to use a Session Cookie on the Site when a User is shopping or
purchasing items (eg site credit or site membership packages) so that any items
added into the ‘basket’ are all available at the end of the session within the
‘Checkout’ Section.
c) Users
who directly stream a video through the Site may require having a "Sticky
Session Cookie" installed on their web browser. This Cookie is in place to
improve security and the protection of any streams from unauthorised access,
enabling Users to access the stream even when navigating away from the Site
temporarily.
d) We use
Google Analytics on the Site. Through the use of cookies installed on your
browser by Google when you visit the Site, Google Analytics allows us to
analyse and assess statistical data relating your use of the Site, which is
vital in helping us to monitor and improve various aspects of the Site. An
example of the kind of information Google Analytics tracks include Number of
Pages Visited, Bounce Rate of Pages, Geographical Location of Visitors, Daily
or Monthly Unique Visitors to the Site and so on. Google Analytics does not
share personal information from your web browser or any information which could
allow us to personally identify you. For more details on using Google Analytics
please see Google's Privacy Policy.
e) Any
Payment Processors which you can access through the site may also send cookies
to your browser in order to properly track and identify you when you use their
services. These cookies are used only to ensure secure and reliable
identification while you follow any payment or money-related procedures or
services.
f)
Through our Site’s Affiliate Programme, any Users who access our Site through
an Affiliate link (or Affiliate advert) on the web will have a Persistent
Cookie installed on their browser. This Cookie will automatically expire and be
deleted a pre-determined period, usually 1 to 30 days. Using this Cookie we can
identify if any specific users - who have accessed our Site through an
Affiliate advert - make any purchases or complete any significant transactions
on the Site, thereby enabling us to calculate the payment amounts due to the
Members of our Affiliate Programme.
g) Web
browsers all have various settings on how you can handle Cookies. You can
always delete all Cookies stored on your browser through its History Settings.
You can also change the Options so that the browser can refuse access to All or
Certain types of Cookies. Refusing access to Cookies through your browser
however is likely to reduce the amount of services and sites you are able to
access over the web and impact on your browsing experience.

aspects of the Site, including but without limitation to, the credit card
payment processors or Adobe™ Flash Video playing software, are not associated

or external links which are accessed or made available through the Site.
