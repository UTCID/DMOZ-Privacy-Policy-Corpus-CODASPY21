Our, Ours, etc.) refer to Millennium TGA, Inc., the operator and
publisher of the Sites. Additionally, the terms “Site” and
“Sites” refer to the website(s) listed here:

In email, text, and other electronic messages between You and Us;
When You interact with Our advertising and applications on third-party

It does not apply to information collected by:

any modifications to this GDPR Policy by re-visiting this web page and

and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information, visit
