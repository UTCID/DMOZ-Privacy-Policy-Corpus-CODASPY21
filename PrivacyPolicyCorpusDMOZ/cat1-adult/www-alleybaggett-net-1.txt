PERSONAL NOTE
Any regular visitor of my website knows that I own the images and content available on my website. I have invested a lot of time and money trying to make my website the best possible for my fans. However, the widespread unauthorized use of my name and images on the Internet is greatly affecting my ability to present you with the best and most enjoyable website. Moreover, a number of people are using my name and image to commercially exploit my fans while trading off my name and image that I have worked so hard to establish. Over the years, I have attempted to stop such unauthorized use of my name and image and many of my fans have supported my efforts by kepping me informed regarding sites that use or trade my images. To assist me in these efforts, I have retained Dennis L. Wilson, an attorney specializing in Internet law, to assist me in stopping the unauthorized use of my name and images. Hopefully, my efforts will result in a better official website for all my fans. Thank you for all your support. If you wish to use either my name or image on your website, please contact me for authorization.
