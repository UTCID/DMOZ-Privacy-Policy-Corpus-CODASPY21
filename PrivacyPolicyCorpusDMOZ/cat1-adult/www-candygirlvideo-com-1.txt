Privacy Policy
We here at CandyGirl Video respect the privacy of our customers. Thus, we will never sell our customers personal information to other sites or companies.
We will never put our customers on any type of spam email lists from other companies. Any tangible products ordered thru our site, such as DVDs, will
be shipped in plain mailing boxes that give no clue to what's inside the package and the mailing label will simply read that it's from "CGV". Credit and
debit cards used to purchase tangible products from our site will have their statements read that they were billed by "Scottish Nightmare" which is our
parent company.
We may in the future send our DVD customers and site members both, or either, offers in the mail or offers via email (things such as DVD catalogs or
electronic e-zines sent via email). If you would not like to receive any of these mailings or emails at any time, just contact us via email and ask us
to remove you from our mailing list and we will.
If you have any further questions please read our FAQ or just send us an email us.
