COLORS
CNV strives to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on the Site. However, because the colors you see will depend on your monitor, CNV cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate.
AVAILABILITY, ERRORS AND INACCURACIES
If an item is out of stock, it cannot be purchased.
Occasionally, a product package will be updated though the product remains identical. The depiction of the product package you order may differ from the product package you receive.
CNV's acknowledgement of an order means that your order request has been received; it does not mean that your order has been accepted or shipped, or that the availability of an item has been confirmed. CNV makes a conscientious effort to describe and display its products and services accurately on the Site. Despite these efforts, a small number of the items on the Site may be described inaccurately or unavailable, and we may experience lags in uploading updates throughout the Site and in our advertising on other sites. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information, including, product images, specifications, availability and services. CNV reserves the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies or omissions at any time without prior notice. We apologize for any inconvenience.
As part of our shipping procedures, we verify the availability before an item is shipped out.
If an item is no longer available, or we determine that there were inaccuracies in our product information, we will make every effort to route your order to another supplier at no additional cost to you.
If we cannot fill your order by any other means, we will cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation via email.

The risk of loss and title to products purchased on the Site pass to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier.
RETURNS

Our customer service representatives will work with you to come up with the best solution for your situation by: replacing the original item or refunding your money as store credit to your account, then helping you find the product you prefer, and placing a new order for you.
To use our guarantee program, contact customer service.
All product returns require a Return Merchandise Authorization, (RMA) number.
Customer service representatives will provide shipping instructions. Do not repackage the order and return it to the "shipped from" address.
Returns of products that are not defective or damaged incur a 20% processing fee.
UNDELIVERABLE ORDERS
Please take care in providing your shipping information. What you provide is exactly how your shipping label will be printed. Orders returned to us as undeliverable will result in a 20% processing fee and no shipping refund will be issued.
