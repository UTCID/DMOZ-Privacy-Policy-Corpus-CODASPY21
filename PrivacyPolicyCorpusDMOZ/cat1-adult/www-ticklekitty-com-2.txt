Privacy & Security
Tickle Kitty takes your privacy very seriously, because it’s the key to your trust. When you’re sure your order and personal information is safe with us, you can order with confidence. Here’s how Tickle Kitty's triple-guard protection works:
1. Our Lips Are Sealed. We don’t rent, sell or trade our mailing list. All your personal information is kept completely confidential. Your information never leaves our control. We guard each name and transaction like it’s our own.
2. Our Website Is Secure.Our shopping cart is Level 1 PCI DSS complaint and we use 128bit encryption to secure communications between your computer and our servers. In other words, your data and information you share with us is safe!
3. Our Packages Are Discreet. When your order arrives at your door, it’s in a plain box—with NO CLUES as to what’s inside. The return address label simply says it's from “TK Press”. Your neighbors, family, snooping roommates, and even the deliveryman, will suspect nothing.
