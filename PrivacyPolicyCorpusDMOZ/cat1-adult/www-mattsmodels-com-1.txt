Matt's Models Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use and access to any of our sites, collectively known as "The Sites", which includes http://www.mattsmodels.com.
We are committed to protecting your privacy. The following information is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, disseminate and safeguard the information you provide to us while accessing and using our Sites. By accessing and using our Sites, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our information practices, please do not access or use our Sites. As provided below, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, add or remove portions of this policy at any time by posting such changes to this page. Such changes will be effective upon posting. The Sites request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully and consult it regularly.
Protecting Your Files on Your Computer
There are frequent instances where you may wish to maintain your privacy by keeping your Internet traces or sensitive files on your computer secure from others. We suggest that you consider privacy software such as PrivacyView.
PrivacyView protects all your sensitive and private files. This software encrypts Internet surfing traces and sensitive data. PrivacyView's system of secure password protection works much better than manually deleting Internet history, cookies, favorites and temp files.
In addition to privatizing the surfing experience, PrivacyView gives you the ability to conceal downloaded pictures and movies on your computer by encrypting and hiding the files. Once the downloaded content is stored, the images and movies can be searched and retrieved for viewing within PrivacyView.
The software is inexpensive, comes with support and instantly gives you piece of mind. You can learn more about privacy software, or try PrivacyView for free, at www.privacyview.com.
