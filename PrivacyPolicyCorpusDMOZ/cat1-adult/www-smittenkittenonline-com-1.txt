SHIPPING & DELIVERY The risk of loss and title for all merchandise ordered on this Web site pass to you when the merchandise is delivered to the shipping carrier. The Smitten Kitten uses the United States Postal Service (USPS) and United Parcel Service of America (UPS) as its carriers. USA shipping & handling rates are based upon weight of each individual package/items and the postage cost for the shipping carrier and service you select.
Please be aware that the United Parcel Service (UPS) will require a signature for delivery. This measure is taken to ensure your privacy and the security of your package. Your package will not be left at your doorstep, in your lobby, etc. without a signature. For more information on UPS shipping procedures, please visit www.ups.com.
The United States Postal Service (USPS) will NOT require a signature for delivery unless you request signature confirmation at the time you place your order. For more information on USPS shipping procedures, please visit www.usps.com.A shipping and handling fee is applied to all orders. The shipping and handling cost is a non-negotiable flat rate fee that covers the cost of postage as well as handling and packaging costs. If a delivery is refused by the customer without Smitten Kitten authorization, a fee for return shipment and/or a restocking fee may be deducted from any potential refund. While we strive to expedite and deliver all orders as quickly as possible, we ask all customers to allow us 7-10 business days for delivery time after The Smitten Kitten has processed your order, although an order may be delivered in quicker time. Once an order is placed into our database, it takes time to process in fulfillment and ship out. Postal delays can increase delivery times.
