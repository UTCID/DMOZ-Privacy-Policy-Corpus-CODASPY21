10. Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") – for California residents
The CCPA provides California resident users of Redbubble.com (referred to in this section as “California consumers”) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes California consumers’ rights and explains how they can exercise them.
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
California consumers have the right to certain information about Redbubble’s collection and use of their personal information over the past 12 months. Sections 3, 4 and 5 above describe the types of personal information Redbubble collects, how it is processed by Redbubble and the third parties with whom Redbubble shares such information and the purpose for that sharing.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
California consumers have the right to request that Redbubble deletes any of their personal information collected from them, subject to certain exceptions set out in the CCPA. These rights may be exercised by clicking this link: ‘Do not sell my Personal Information’ (also in the footer) or by emailing privacy@redbubble.com.Only the relevant California consumer, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that is authorized to act on a California consumer’s behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to that California consumer’s personal information. California consumers can also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor child.
California consumers may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:
provide sufficient information that allows Redbubble to reasonably verify identity; and
describe the request with sufficient detail that allows Redbubble to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Response Timing and Format
Redbubble will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If more time is required (up to 90 days), Redbubble will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. There is no fee for processing verifiable consumer requests unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
Non-Discrimination
Redbubble will not discriminate against anyone for exercising any of their CCPA rights. However, certain financial incentives may be offered to the extent permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive that is offered will reasonably relate to California consumers’ personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program would require prior opt in consent, which may be revoked at any time.
Other California Privacy Rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits California consumers to request certain information regarding Redbubble’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@redbubble.com.
