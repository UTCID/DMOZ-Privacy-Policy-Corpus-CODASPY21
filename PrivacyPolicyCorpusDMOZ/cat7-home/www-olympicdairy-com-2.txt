Third Party Information and Hyperlinks
Although Ultima monitors the information contained on the Website, some of

While Ultima makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all information

Nutritional information
Subjects related to nutrition or health may be discussed on the Website, but
they must not be interpreted as professional advice. Always consult a
nutritionist or a health care professional before making any changes to your
diet.
Anonymous Information Gathered through the Website
Ultima gathers anonymous information respecting the use of its Website.
Thus, Ultima uses various technological tools to know which pages of its
Website have been consulted by visitors, to determine the frequency with
which hyperlinks are used and to compile statistics on visitors and their use
of the Website. This information is gathered by means of an analytical platform (such as: Google Analytics), log files and cookies. This anonymous information is gathered in such a way that Ultima is unable to identify you.
Ultima may post advertisements based on areas of interest on this Website,
which is owned by Ultima, as well as on the other websites it operates and on
any other third-party websites, using the anonymous information gathered
when you consult this Website. Advertising campaigns based on areas of
interest, which are sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted
advertising campaigns, are displayed based on the anonymous information
gleaned from your activities on the Website and from any other websites you
may have visited that posted content or advertising campaigns from Ultima.
Like other online advertising networks, Ultima uses cookies, web beacons
(also known as web bugs) and other technologies (collectively, the “ Cookies ”). Cookies allow Ultima to determine which advertisements you
see, which advertisements you click on and the other things you do when you
consult the Website. This allows Ultima to offer you more useful and relevant
advertising. For example, if Ultima is able to know what advertising is
presented to you, it can avoid showing you the same advertising repeatedly.
Ultima does not connect your activities on third-party websites to your
identity when Ultima offers you advertisements based on areas of interest.
Advertisers or advertising agencies working on their behalf sometimes use
various technological tools to send the advertising campaigns that appear on
our Website directly to your web browser. To do so, they automatically obtain
your IP address. They can also use Cookies to measure the efficiency of their
advertising campaigns and to personalize advertising content. Ultima has no
access to or control over these Cookies or other technological tools that thirdparty advertisers or websites might use.
Generally, you may choose not to receive personalized advertising
campaigns from third-party advertisers and advertising networks that are
members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or that subscribe to the
Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising by
visiting the opt-out page of the websites of the NAI and the Digital
Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can also disable Google Analytics for Display
Advertising and customize the advertisements displayed on the Google
Display Network via the Ads Settings page (link).
