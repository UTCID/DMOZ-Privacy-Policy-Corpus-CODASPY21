The Project stores profile information in order to keep statistical records and determine the successes of the Site. Aggregate and anonymous data that is not personally identifiable as well as other non-personally identifiable information collected automatically through using the Site (see clause 1B) may be submitted to third parties that provide website analysis tools, mapping services, and mass mail/sender analysis services in order to determine and report the demographics of users and the successes and impacts of The Site. Aggregate and anonymous data may also be submitted to our investors/grantors, to Site members, and Site visitors in order to reflect the statistical impacts and demographics of the Site.
You certify that the information you provide is provided voluntarily, and may be used to maintain your user account, facilitate participation in the Service, and to determine the demographics and general successes of The Site.  You are encouraged to avoid submitting any information to The Project site that you are not comfortable sharing publicly with others.
Users can view and access their information through their personal profile pages. You are responsible for changing or maintaining your information except as noted in Part 2, keeping it up-to-date to reflect an accurate profile, and limiting the amount of information that is displayed publicly on your profile.  The Project may collect your credit card information for the purposes of donations when you make them, but will not save the credit card information.
