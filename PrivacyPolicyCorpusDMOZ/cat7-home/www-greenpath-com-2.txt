Use of Site and/or Service
The GreenPath website at www.greenpath.com and the GreenPath Portal (“Site“) and the services provided (“Service“) are maintained and operated by GreenPath, Inc. (“us,” “we,” “our,” or “Company”) with its registered office at 36500 Corporate Drive, Farmington Hills, MI 48331.  GreenPath has one goal: Empowering people to lead financially healthy lives.  Thus, we offer this Site and Services for you to view information and documents (collectively, “Materials”), use chat and message services (“Forums”) as they are made available from time to time in our sole discretion, and make purchases of our products and services as such functionality is made available from time to time in our sole discretion.  Please note that you must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services on this Site.  If you breach any of the Terms in these Terms of Use (“Terms”), your authorization to use this Site or these Services automatically terminates.
Registration Requirements
Registration is not required or necessary to browse our Site. You may voluntarily provide your contact information for a GreenPath employee to contact you regarding our services.  As a GreenPath client, you have the opportunity to view your personal documents online and use advanced messaging services. In order to do so, you must first set up your user name and password using a valid email address.
You agree that the information you supply will be accurate and that you will not supply the email address of, or register under the name of, another person. We reserve the right to reject any username we deem offensive or inappropriate. Users of the Site (“Users”) may not register as a business name.
Account Responsibility
Users are solely responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others. You are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site. You agree to notify GreenPath, Inc. immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
While it is acceptable for Users to maintain multiple accounts, GreenPath can and does track multiple shared accounts from a single or multiple computers as one account in terms of these Terms of Use violations. If the Terms of Use are violated severely enough to warrant the banning of one account, all known accounts shared between a single or multiple Users who use the same computer may also be banned for the actions of the violating account at the administrators’ discretion.
Because of this rule, it is highly recommended that Users do not share their accounts with others, nor share their computers used to access the site with others, as the actions of some other person could easily directly impact all known shared message board accounts.
Should a user be temporary blocked from the site based on violations of these Terms of Use, we ask that they comply with the banned period. Permanent bans will result should Users intentionally abuse access or “hack” their way onto the site using Proxy IP addresses.
Text Messages
You will receive text reminders related to our Services. Frequency may vary by account and preferences.  STANDARD DATA FEES AND TEXT MESSAGING RATES MAY APPLY BASED ON YOUR PLAN WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE CARRIER.  As mobile access and text message delivery is subject to your mobile carrier network availability, such access and delivery is not guaranteed.  You may opt-out of text delivery at any time by texting STOP in response to one of our text messages, BY TEXTING STOP TO (855) 218-7795, (855) 219-4486, (855) 219-4426, (866) 564-6468, OR (866) 750-7545, OR BY CONTACTING US AT (800) 550-1961.
Privacy and Release of Information
Under normal circumstances, GreenPath will never release your provided information to any third party without your consent.  However, in cases of Terms of Use violations or illegal activities, we reserve the right to forward any and all known information about you and your accounts to your ISP (including libraries, schools, and places of employment), email service provider, your ISP account owner (if someone else is actually paying for it), and any parties whose copyright has clearly been infringed by your actions on the boards, or requests from law enforcement authorities.
All of the information that we collect from you, such as registration and credit card information, is subject to our Privacy Policy. Please click here to see our full Privacy Policy.
User Conduct
You agree that you will not use the Site to perform the following actions:
Impersonation
Users may be immediately banned (along with any associated accounts) for impersonating other Users by creating and/or using an account with a name clearly intended to impersonate, mock, or antagonize another user, or otherwise falsely claiming to be another message board member.
Unauthorized Access
Accessing or attempting to access any GreenPath user account not belonging to the user in question without permission is prohibited. Accessing another user’s account in this manner is grounds for immediate loss of all known accounts, and may result in criminal and civil liability.
Bugs and Exploits
Using exploits or tricks in the GreenPath code to gain privileges, access, or abilities not clearly intended by the board design is prohibited. Making exploits public or using them for personal benefit is grounds for immediate loss of all known accounts, and may result in criminal and civil liability.
Other
Any other activity that is clearly detrimental to the flow of conversation and normal activities of GreenPath and its Users may also be deleted.
