Use of brands
As use of DPIE-owned trademarks, logos and brands often implies endorsement, these can't be used without the express permission of the organisation.

Links from our website
This website contains links to other websites (linked sites). These links have been included on the site with the intention of increasing the information available to you. If you use these links, you may leave this website. DPIE has no control over linked sites, and therefore:
we can't accept responsibility or liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense you might incur if you rely on information appearing on linked sites
when you visit a linked site, you will be subject to the privacy policy of that site and will no longer be protected by the privacy policy of the DPIE site
we are not responsible for the views, opinions, standards or information expressed on linked sites. The provision of a link does not imply that we endorse those sites or the people or companies who own them, and vice versa.

Logos, emblems and trademarks of the State of NSW and/or the Department and its cluster agencies must not be used for web linking purposes.

Disclaimer
While website material has been created with all due care, the Department does not warrant or represent that the material is free from errors or omission, or that it is exhaustive.

Bearing in mind the importance of freedom of expression to our democratic society, the NSW Government does not necessarily endorse or support the views, opinions, standards or information expressed at any linked sites. Similarly, you should not interpret the absence of a link from the NSW Government site to any particular third-party site as a criticism or comment by the NSW Government on the provider or content of that site.
