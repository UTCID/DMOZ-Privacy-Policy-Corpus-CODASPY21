Effective August 22, 2019
Retail Competitors - Stores
If you find a lower price on an identical brand and model number currently available for sale at another local competitor's retail store, Sears will match that price. Just bring in the original advertisement to a sales associate at the time of your purchase. The competitor price must be offered on the same date as the date of your purchase. Price match is eligible only on the day you make your purchase.
Retail Competitors - Online
If you find a lower online price (including any costs for shipping and handling, but not delivery) on an identical brand and model number currently available from a local competitor's retail store honoring its own online price and the item is currently available for sale and delivery in your area, Sears will match the price of the merchandise. Just print the ordering page (including the costs for shipping and handling), and bring it to your Sears store at the time of your purchase. If you are purchasing the item from sears.com, please contact us via phone at 1-800-697-3277. The competitor price must be offered on the same date as the date of your purchase. Sears will not price match internet-only retailers or marketplace or third party sellers on competitor's web sites. Price match is eligible only on the day you make your purchase.
Sears Branded Stores and Sears Branded Websites
If you find a lower price on an identical brand and model number from another Sears branded non-outlet retail format or website, Sears will match that price for up to 30 days after the date of your purchase. Sears will not price match limited time Online Only events, special Online Price, or conditional Online Only Special Offers on our websites. Only items listed as Sold by Sears are eligible for price matching on our websites. Sears will not price match any Marketplace items or any items sold by Sears Outlet or searsoutlet.com. All other exclusions also apply.

Price Protection Policy
Buy with confidence from Sears. If an item you have purchased from Sears goes on sale for a lower price within 30 days of your purchase, Sears will refund the difference. This Price Protection period is a full 365 days for our “Best Stuff” mattresses!  What's our "Best Stuff?" Signs in our mattress department will tell you which top of the line mattresses we think are our Best Stuff.  Ask an associate for details or visit [sears.com/best-mattresses] for a  list of model numbers.
All Price Match rules and exclusions apply including no Price Protection adjustments between Thanksgiving Day and the Wednesday after Thanksgiving. Sears will not offer a price adjustment on items that include individual Shop Your Way bonus or extra point offers. To claim a Price Protection Policy adjustment, go to your original Sears store where the purchase was made with your receipt. If your purchase was made on Sears.com, please fill out a Price Protection form. You will be given a refund for the difference of the original selling price and the current advertised/reduced price. Apparel clearance merchandise and conditional Online Only Special Offers do not qualify for Price Protection Policy adjustments.
Price Match Policy FAQs
What if the local competitor item is not listed as being limited quantity, but the item is not in stock?
If a local competitor is out of stock of the particular item, we will
not match the local competitor price. In stock means that the item is
available for same day pickup. We reserve the right to call the local
competitor to verify if the item is in stock.
What do you consider to be a local competitor retail store?
Local competitor retail store refers to a store that is in the same
market area and/or within a reasonable distance of our store.
How do you handle a price match if the Sears price includes a promotional offer such as a free gift card or rebate?
The Sears net purchase price is calculated by deducting the value of all
instant and mail-in discounts such as rebates, free offers and
promotional gift cards. Existing rebates and free offers associated with
a product purchased at Sears will not apply if a price match is
executed.
What does identical item mean?
An identical item is the same brand and model number. This item must be
new and incarton and include the same US warranty and same accessories
as the Sears item. For tires in Sears Automotive, identical means the
same brand, model number and tire size.
What are the other Sears branded formats?
Sears branded non-outlet retail formats or websites include Sears, Sears
Grand, Sears Hardware, Sears Hometown Stores, sears.com, and
searshometownstores.com. We do not price match merchandise from Sears
Outlet Stores, searsoutlet.com, or any Marketplace items on Sears
Holdings websites.
Does Sears match retail stores that require a membership?
Sears will match membership club stores. Customers must present their
current membership card along with the proof of the price that is being
matched. Sears does not price match military PX retail stores.
