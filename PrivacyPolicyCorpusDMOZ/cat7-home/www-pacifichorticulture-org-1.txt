Privacy Policy
Non-Personal Information
We at Pacific Horticulture Society (“PHS”) are very respectful of your privacy concerns. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the PHS site. However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded via standard website analytics tools. This information is used to provide an enhanced online experience for our visitors. Information tracked includes the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor’s Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Quest). By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor’s computer are automatically available to that visitor. Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of visitors to the site but only in an aggregate and non-personally identifiable form.

E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to PHS only when voluntarily submitted. Personally identifiable information collected when visitors voluntarily fill out contact forms is retained by PHS. This information is used to better understand visitors’ use of our site and is never sold, shared, or rented to others.
