Tech, and The Right to Privacy and Protection of Your Data
As we navigate our increasingly dynamic and connected digital world, people must be able to maintain their privacy, safety, and security on- and off-line. That’s why we led the development of the Digital Standard to guard consumers’ digital privacy and security, and why we press companies and policymakers to give people more control over the use of their personal data. We also work for a fair and open marketplace by promoting more choices and lower prices through net neutrality, competition among tech and media companies, and efforts to stop unwanted robocalls.
