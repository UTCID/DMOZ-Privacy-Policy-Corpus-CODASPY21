The Investment Management Education Alliance (IMEA) is a trade association committed to education of the investor and does not allow any agent, employee or representative to personally solicit any investment or accept any monies to be invested in a particular fund or security. Investments and solicitations for investment are made directly with an agent, employee or representative of an investment company and not with this Association. Contact the Investment Management Education Alliance if any person or organization solicits funds from you while representing that they are an agent, employee or representative of the Investment Management Education Alliance.
Disclaimer of Warranty.
This website provides data on investment companies which are members of the IMEA as well as companies which do not belong to the Trade Association. The daily price and performance data, total net assets, 12b-1 fee, expense ratio and maximum redemption fee found at this site is provided by Morningstar, Inc. which is an independent firm that provides data to the investment industry. Morningstar Inc., its third party data vendors and The Investment Management Education Alliance make no warranties whatsoever, either expressed or implied, as to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or any other matter. Morningstar, Inc and The Investment Management Education Alliance further do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information, text, graphics, links or other items contained within these materials.

Performance Results.
Performance results are provided at this site for use by investors as a barometer of past performance. Past performance is no indication of future results, and values fluctuate. Fund historical performance does not promise the same results in the future. Principal value, share price and investment returns fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares.
Before You Invest.
Before you invest in any fund, request a copy of the fund's prospectus and read it carefully. The prospectus contains information on a fund's objectives and strategies, risks and expenses. Read it carefully to make sure that the fund is appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance before you purchase shares or invest money.
