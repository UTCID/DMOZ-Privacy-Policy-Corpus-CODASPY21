We actively seek out copyright violations on the Internet and in print and will use full legal force to deal with any infringement of our rights. The only exception to this rule is linking to articles (see below).
Trademarks

Other www.dpreview.com graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are trademarks or trade dress of ours.  Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not ours, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits us.

Hot linking:
"Hot linking" refers to the practice of inserting a link in a piece of HTML to an image on another server. Due to a recent rash of people using hot linking to our copyrighted images in numerous ways, such as on their own web pages, in articles, on commercial sites, and in ebay auctions, we have had to put a technical block on the serving of images from the Web Site. Images can now only be seen where they were intended, on pages within this Web Site. Hot linking takes server time, control, copyright and bandwidth away from the real users of this Web Site and we will not allow it. If you would like to use an image from the Web Site please contact us first and ask permission.

IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
Applicable Law
By visiting the Web Site, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us.
Disputes
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Web Site, goods, or services sold or distributed by or through the Web Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
a. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
b. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA  98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.  We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
c. You and the Web Site each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and the Web Site each waive any right to a jury trial.  Both parties also agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Modification and Severability
We reserve the right to make changes to the Web Site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
