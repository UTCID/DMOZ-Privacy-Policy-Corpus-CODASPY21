Paul Donohue – President and Founder

Paul took advantage of his banking experience to establish Credit Card Management Services, Inc., branded as Debthelper.com, in 1996. Paul has served as its President since inception.

The processors are critical to making sure the credit card companies accept the proposed terms in a timely fashion. Client Services handles thousands of calls a year closing problem reports only after the client says the problem is fixed. The majority of calls by these dedicated employees are outgoing calls to make sure clients are getting the full benefit from their program with DebtHelper.com.
Counseling Department
The counselors spend 90% of their time in telephone or personal consultations with clients helping them get control of their financial lives. Counselors make sure the financial plan, which some time results in getting clients back on track without joining a program. Counselors are partners with their clients every step of the way to financial freedom.
Operations Department

These people are the unsung heroes of the company who make sure payments are processed with a goal of zero defects.
