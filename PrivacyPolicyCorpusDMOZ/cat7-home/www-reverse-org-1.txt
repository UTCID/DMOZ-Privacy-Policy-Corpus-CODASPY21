You can visit us on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your e-mail address. In this case, our web servers collect the name of the domain you used to access the Internet, such as “aol.com” or “yahoo.com,” as well as the web site you came from and the web site you visit next.
We may select outside companies who provide services on our behalf and use this information in the course of delivering advertisements to you and to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to our web site, in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance and to make the site easier and more convenient to use.
We may aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and services, and provide these statistics to third parties. However, when we provide these statistics to third parties, they will not include any personal information that identifies you, unless you have agreed to receive personally-tailored information.
When you fill out a form on our web site, such as the Calculator or the Contact Us form, we collect information to help us answer your inquiry.
