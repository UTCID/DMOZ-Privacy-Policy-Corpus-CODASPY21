This is achieved either by the deterrence of fully operational CCTV cameras or effective intruder image recording if the deterrence fails.  The recording is not retained beyond 30 days unless there is incident information required for investigation or evidential purposes.The external cameras are fixed and specifically sited to cover the entrances of FCC premises and shielded “blind spots” (areas that are not open to public access) around the periphery of all FCC buildings. They are day/night (infrared) capable.Data is securely stored on the recording machine within the computer room at Malvern. This is a hard disk system in an interior room with controlled access.  The system automatically overwrites recordings after 30 days.  No additional copies are held.Interior cameras are movement activated and focussed on the main working area and provide additional alarm capability to the fitted intruder alarm system. They are in operation outside normal working hours and are internally focussed. Out of hours all shutters are down and no external views are possible. They are day/night (infrared) capable. The images are stored on a remote internet storage capability for 30 days.The view is restricted to the FCC premises with the exception of some road coverage on the periphery of the cameras due to their necessary location to fulfil their main security function.In the unlikely case that ‘passer-by’ images are captured, or partially captured, they are not retained, shared or accessed beyond those with security/CCTV access within FCC. Individuals concerned about possible image/data capture should contact duty@fostercarecooperative.co.uk, relating the date, time and location of concern. This will be treated as a Subject Access Request which we would request, supported by an identifiable image of the applicant. Any image request beyond 30 days cannot be fulfilled as no archive images are retained.Changes to our policyWe reserve the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy, and we will post those changes on this page. Please review this page on a regular basis for changes. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy Statement under which the information was collected.
