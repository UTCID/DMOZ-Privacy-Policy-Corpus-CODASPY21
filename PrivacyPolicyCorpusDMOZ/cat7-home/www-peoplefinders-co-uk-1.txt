PeopleFinders Terms of Use
Consumer | Enterprise
Last Updated: January 1, 2020
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF SERVICE
This Terms of Use (the “Agreement” or “Terms”) is an agreement between you and PeopleFinders who owns and controls the website www.peoplefinders.com (collectively, “PeopleFinders”, "us", "our" or "we") and sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the website www.peoplefinders.com, and any successor websites, (collectively the “Site”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications and mobile-focused websites (the Site and other PeopleFinders interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “PeopleFinders Applications"). The Terms govern your use of the PeopleFinders Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise and any other means or applications in which you connect with us or use our services (“Services”)).
Each time that you access or use PeopleFinders Applications you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to any of the Terms, you must discontinue using PeopleFinders Applications and Services.
Contact and Electronic Communications. By accessing the PeopleFinders Applications or Services, you consent to having this agreement provided to you in electronic form and that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in writing. You acknowledge that when you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide any contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service (“Contact Information”), you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about our Services using the Contact Information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
YOUR USE OF THE PEOPLEFINDERS APPLICATIONS
PeopleFinders provides a database of public records and publicly available sources of information aggregated for your convenience. The PeopleFinders searches, including its background checks, made available by and through the PeopleFinders Applications, are provided for informational purposes only. While we are constantly updating and refining our database and Services, we do not represent or warrant that the results provided will be 100% accurate and up to date and, as such, PeopleFinders shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness, availability or unavailability of any information transmitted or made available via the PeopleFinders Applications. PeopleFinders does not make any representation or warranty as to the character or the integrity of the person, business, or entity that is the subject of any PeopleFinders searches. PeopleFinders also reserves the right to delete any information from its databases at any time.
PEOPLEFINDERS IS NOT A CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY FOR PURPOSES OF THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (“FCRA”). AS SUCH, THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO CONSUMERS, AND OBLIGATIONS PLACED UPON CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES, ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED BY, NOR CONTAINED WITHIN, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
Restrictions on your Use of our Services. You may not use any information obtained from our searches, including, without limitation, the PeopleFinders background checks, in connection with determining a prospective candidate’s suitability for:
Health insurance or any other insurance
Credit and/or loans
Employment
Education, scholarships or fellowships
Housing or other accommodations
Benefits, privileges or services provided by any business establishment
Limited Guarantee. Most of the Services accessible from PeopleFinders Applications come with a limited guarantee; this means that if your search does not return any results, we may provide you with another search, at no additional cost to you, but will not refund your purchase. You acknowledge that the Services are provided "as is." You are paying for us to conduct a search on your behalf, not to return any particular result. Information is often obtained by third parties and the accuracy of the information cannot be guaranteed. Users should use extreme caution when interpreting search results. Some of the information provided in searches is based upon logic-based assumptions from information in our database compiled from public records regarding individuals’ names, addresses, ages, last names and the dates which correspond to these names, addresses and ages. We may also provide you publicly available marriage and divorce records when you conduct a search using our Services. Positive or false matches based on our assumptions or records may not provide conclusive confirmation of an individual’s status (marital or otherwise).
Therefore, we urge you to independently verify any information you gather from our PeopleFinders Applications as a possibility exists that our search results could be inaccurate.
Personal Use Only. The PeopleFinders Applications, the content and the Services are intended for your personal, noncommercial use in accordance with these Terms. You agree that you will not, unless specifically permitted by us (i) copy, display or distribute any part of the content or PeopleFinders Applications, in any medium, without PeopleFinders prior written consent, or (ii) alter or modify any part of the PeopleFinders Applications other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the PeopleFinders Applications for their intended purpose. You further agree that you will not use any automated devices, such as spiders, robots or data mining techniques to download, store or otherwise reproduce, store or distribute content or to manipulate the PeopleFinders Applications or Services. You will take no action to interfere with, interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of the PeopleFinders Applications or any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment. You may not use the PeopleFinders Applications or Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any PeopleFinders server, or the network(s) connected to any PeopleFinders server, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of any PeopleFinders Applications or Services. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any PeopleFinders Applications or Services, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to any PeopleFinders server or to any of the PeopleFinders Applications or Services, through hacking, cracking, and distribution of counterfeit software, password mining or any other means. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available through the PeopleFinders Applications or Services, including but not limited to using any network monitoring or discovery software to determine the architecture of PeopleFinders Applications or extract information about usage, individual identities or users. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any software accessed through PeopleFinders Applications or Services, including any proprietary communications protocol used by PeopleFinders. You may not use information obtained from the PeopleFinders Applications to transmit any commercial, advertising, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation, harass, offend, threaten, embarrass, or invade the privacy of any individual or entity, or violate any applicable law, regulation or rule.
You also agree to adhere to the following:
You will use the Services only for appropriate, legal purposes, and in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
You will obtain any and all necessary licenses, certificates, permits, approvals or other authorizations required by federal, state or local statute, law or regulation that govern your use of the Services.
You will not use the Services in a manner that may cause emotional or physical harm to anyone, or to "stalk" or otherwise harass another person.
You will not use the Services to seek information about or harm minors in any way.
You will not use the Services to seek information about celebrities or public figures.
You will not use the Service to promote or provide instructional information about illegal activities or promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual.
You will not resell, sell, lease, license, sublicense or otherwise commercialize any of the information you obtain from the Services without our prior written consent.
You will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information you receive from the Services is stored in a secure manner.
Legal Notices about your Searches. We have not considered or assessed the specific risk that any convicted sex offender displayed on a search will commit another offense or the nature of any future crimes that may be committed. Only information on registered sex offenders allowed to be legally disclosed appears on a search. Some registered sex offenders are not subject to public disclosure, so that they are not included on the search. State law does not allow offenses other than the crimes for which the convicted sex offender is required to register to be disclosed. Extreme care must be taken in the use of information in a search because mistaken identity may occur when relying solely upon name, age, and address to identify individuals. If you believe that any information in a search is in error, please contact a police or sheriff's department, or contact the Department of Justice by e-mail at MegansLaw@doj.ca.gov. In some states, like California, it is illegal to use information obtained through public records to commit a crime against a registered sex offender or to engage in discrimination or harassment against a registered sex offender. Criminal misuse of this information subjects the person who misuses it to a sentence enhancement, in addition to the punishment for the crime committed. Civil misuse of this information may subject the person to civil damages and penalties pursuant to California Penal Code Section 290.4 (e) (3) (A).
Registration Obligations. In consideration of your use of the PeopleFinders Applications, you represent and agree that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving our Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction and will provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by PeopleFinders Applications. PeopleFinders reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the PeopleFinders Applications or Services without notice for any or no reason.
Security of Username and Password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account for any PeopleFinders Applications you interact with.
You agree not to disclose any login or password for your use of the Services to anyone.
Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify PeopleFinders immediately of any unauthorized use or theft of your account(s) or any other breach of security (and to provide properly documented evidence as reasonably requested by PeopleFinders). We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you will be liable for losses incurred by PeopleFinders or another party due to someone else using your account or password.
PEOPLEFINDERS SERVICES
Individual Searches. You can use the PeopleFinders Applications to search for basic information about people, such as address or phone number; basic information for an email address, such as name, phone, address, and relatives; and you can search for information in public records, such as birth records and marriage records.
Premium Searches. You can use the PeopleFinders Applications to order background checks, which provide comprehensive information about a person; reverse phone reports, which provide information such as the name, address, historical records, and connection status verification on a phone number; statewide criminal reports, which allow you to conduct statewide criminal searches for information such as name, age, gender, and offense details; and nationwide criminal reports, which allow you to search for the same type of information as the statewide criminal reports on a nationwide level.
PeopleFinders Memberships. PeopleFinders offers numerous memberships, which allow you to conduct various types of searches for a monthly or annual fee, or a discounted per report fee.
MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS; CHARGES ON YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT; REFUND POLICY
One Time Service Fees. PeopleFinders Services are available for a one-time license fee. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, please contact us within 30 (thirty) days from the original date of purchase to discuss your concerns. If we cannot solve your concerns, we may provide you with another search, at no additional cost to you. We will not refund your purchase.
Membership Service Fees. If you sign up for our monthly membership or other subscription term you select ("Membership Service") PeopleFinders bills you for your online account using the billing information you provide (your "Billing Account") for use of the Membership Service which enables you to conduct searches during your term of membership you select. A one month term is agreed by you to be a 30-day period. You agree to pay PeopleFinders all charges at the prices then in effect for your use of the Membership Service using your Billing Account, and any applicable taxes, and you authorize PeopleFinders to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the Membership Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method (the "Payment Method Provider"). If PeopleFinders does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. In the event we are advised of insufficient funds in your account or credit to cover your payment by credit card, we may re-present such uncleared or rejected payment to your Payment Method Provider. PeopleFinders reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment and to update your information from available third party sources. You can cancel your membership at any point during your current subscription term to avoid subsequent fees being billed by using our contact form located at https://www.peoplefinders.com/contact or by logging into your account, https://www.peoplefinders.com/login, clicking on the "Your Account" tab and going to the section entitled "Your Membership”. Because of the user access granted to you during the period of membership, all monthly charges are NON-REFUNDABLE regardless of the amount of time left on your monthly term. If you cancel a longer subscription term membership you may receive a pro-rata refund based upon any full months left on your term. Pro-rata months are not refunded. All prices are in US Dollars and do not include Internet service provider, telephone, and other connection charges.
Free or Introductory Promotional Offers. If you have joined under a special introductory trial offer (for example, a discounted or free initial trial) (“Trial”), you hereby acknowledge that unless you cancel before the expiration of your Trial, the applicable fee for the subscription term selected will be posted to your Payment Method on the day after the trial period is completed. In order to receive any refund for a charge made after you have cancelled you must provide proof of cancellation. Such proof will be limited to the automated confirmation email from PeopleFinders showing the date and time of said cancellation.
Limitation on Re-activation. You agree that there is one (1) introductory or Trial offer for use per member/computer/email address. You further agree that if and when you choose to re-activate and continue your membership, your account will re-activate at the then current monthly fee. Use of multiple Trials by you is prohibited and PeopleFinders may charge one regular monthly fee for each additional Trial used by you after the first, even if each subsequent membership Trial is cancelled within the said Trial period.
Cancellation. You may cancel your membership at any time by contacting our Customer Care Department at 800-718-8997. When you cancel automatic renewal on a monthly membership (or a longer term subscription), your membership will continue through the rest of the current month. At the end of that period, your membership will not renew automatically, and you will lose the benefits of membership.
Current Information Required. You must promptly notify PeopleFinders if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made by logging into your account, https://www.peoplefinders.com/login, or any other section on the Site that allows you to change your account settings now or in the future. You can also e-mail us by using our contact form located at https://www.peoplefinders.com/contact. If you fail to provide the company any of the foregoing information, you agree that PeopleFinders may continue charging you for any use of the Services under your Billing Account unless we have evidence that you have terminated your membership. Any attorney fees, court costs, or other costs incurred in collection of delinquent undisputed amounts will be the responsibility of and paid for by you.
Search Limits. We do not allow scraping of our data or excessive collection of our data for any purpose.
If you feel your membership has been turned off in error, or if you would like to discuss upgrading your membership to increase the number of reports you may run per day, please contact our Customer Care Department by using our form located at https://www.peoplefinders.com/contact.
When you order a single Reverse Phone Lookup report, we search through our database for all relevant records. In the event that we do not find data internally, we may utilize the services of a third party to provide you with a report, which incurs an additional cost. When you have a PeopleFinders membership, all searches are done internally. We do not utilize the services of any third party for these searches.

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES
Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without application of conflict of laws rules.
Resolution of any Dispute. In the event a dispute arises between you and PeopleFinders, we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by calling our Customer Care Department at 800-718-8997, or by emailing us using our contact form located at https://www.peoplefinders.com/contact. If, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, these Terms describe how both of us will proceed.
Limitation of Legal Remedies. INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND COMPANY EACH AGREE TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON A BILATERAL (INDIVIDUAL) BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. You and PeopleFinders agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of our relationship; the Content accessible from PeopleFinders Applications; claims that may arise after the termination of your membership; and claims related to marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls ("Claim(s)") which cannot be settled through the Customer Care Department refunding your payments in full, shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes Claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
Class Action Waiver. We each agree that each of us are waiving the right to a trial by jury and may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations under these Terms shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person (“class action waiver”).
Arbitration Procedures. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought. All notices to PeopleFinders shall be sent to the following address: PeopleFinders, 1821 Q Street, Sacramento, CA 95811. All notices to you will be sent to the email provided in your Account or by you. Upon receipt of such Notice of Dispute, the other party shall have a sixty (60) day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim and/or providing all the relief requested in the Notice of Dispute, and/or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or PeopleFinders may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration of any Claim under this Agreement shall be referred to the JAMS (“JAMS”) under its rules and procedures, including the JAMS's Comprehensive Arbitration Rules. These rules and procedures are available by calling the JAMS or by visiting its web site at www.jamsadr.com. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $10,000 PeopleFinders will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; and (2) if you prefer will conduct the arbitration by telephone. Attorneys’ fees are recoverable by the prevailing party.
Choice of Law. This arbitration agreement concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. The FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
Venue. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that any litigation arising out of this agreement, whether in arbitration or judicial proceedings, shall be conducted in Sacramento County, California.
Exception. Any claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader or injunctive relief arising out of a Claim shall not be subject to arbitration.
Survival. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this agreement and the closing of your account or membership.
Severability. If any provision of these Terms is declared or found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions shall remain fully enforceable except that if for some reason this prohibition on class action waiver cannot be enforced, then this agreement to arbitrate will not apply.
MISCELLANEOUS
These Terms and policies incorporated herein ("Policies"), are the entire agreement between you and PeopleFinders. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and PeopleFinders relating to your use of the PeopleFinders Applications or the Services. PeopleFinders may assign these Terms in whole or in part, at any time. If any part of these Terms, other than class action waiver as set forth above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. Headings in these Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of these Terms. The failure of PeopleFinders to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of PeopleFinders of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by PeopleFinders or be deemed a waiver by PeopleFinders of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of PeopleFinders under these Terms, its Policies and any other applicable agreement between you and PeopleFinders shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit PeopleFinders right to exercise any other right or remedy.
