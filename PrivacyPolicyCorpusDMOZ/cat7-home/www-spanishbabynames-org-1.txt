Spanish Names
Being able to call someone by their name is always crucial in establishing a relationship and helps avoid ambiguities of the subject pronouns (tú, usted).
The most common names in Spain are an example of society's evolution, although it also shows a certain level of what names are fashionable at the time.
Furthermore, the fact that different languages are spoken in different parts of Spain (Galician, Catalan, Basque, and Castillian) means that the most popular names vary from region to region.
During the transition between dictatorship and democracy, there was a regional and national joy that increased the frequency of names that identified the "children of democracy." Among the most popular are Irati, Naira, Iria, and Laia for girls and Beneharo, Iago, Iker, and Didac for boys.
As the years passed and Spain became more politically and socially stable, the most popular names became more stable and homogenized across the country. While our grandparents are called Francisco, Antonio, José, or Manuel and María, Ana, Carmen, or Dolores, the most common names throughout Spain in 2017 according to the National Institute of Statistics were Lucía, Sofía, María, Martina, and Paula for girls and Lucas, Hugo, Martín, Daniel, and Pablo for boys.
Some of the names that are particular to each language are still popular today. Here are some of the most common by region.
