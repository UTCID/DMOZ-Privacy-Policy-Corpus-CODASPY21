HammerZone.com and its publisher, Maki Media
Group LLC, does not collect any
personal identifying
information from our website visitors.
However, we use third-party
advertising companies (such as Google) to serve ads when you visit
our website. These companies may use information about your visits
to HammerZone.com (and other websites) in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
These third-party companies do not
gather information about your name, address, email address, or
telephone number.
If you would like more information about
this practice and to know your choices about not having this
information used by these companies,

But Wait... There's More!
You should be aware of the following information about Google and
the
DoubleClick DART cookie:
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads
on HammerZone.com.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to
our visitors based on their visit to HammerZone and other sites
on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting
the Google ad

HammerZone.com and Cookies:
We recently discovered that HammerZone's web
server places a "cookie" (a small identifying number) on your
web browser, which means that the web server may recognize your
computer if/when you visit HammerZone.com again. It's our
understanding that most web servers do this.
While the server may keep track of when you
visited, what pages you looked at, and how long you stayed, we don't
know how to access the raw data. And if we could access this
information, we wouldn't know what to do with it. We may have enough
computer knowledge to create web pages, but the topic of web browser cookies is
far above our skill level. We do know that the server uses these
cookies when it creates various web traffic reports, but the reports
do not identify any person or organization.
