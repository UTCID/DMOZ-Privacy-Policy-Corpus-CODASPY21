AGENCY:
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation.
ACTION:
Notice of a modified system of records.
SUMMARY:
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposes to update, reissue, and rename a previously published Department of Transportation (DOT) system of records titled, “Department of Transportation—DOT/NHTSA 415 Artemis/Vehicle Owner Complaint Information.” This system of records allows NHTSA to collect and retain complaints, letters communicating vehicle or equipment concerns, and supporting documentation which may include photos, videos, police accident reports, repair invoices or medical information (collectively, “vehicle owner questionnaires” or “VOQs”) submitted by or on behalf of vehicle or equipment owners and lessees (consumers). NHTSA updated the notice with regards to: System Name to Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) System to appropriately identify the specific records maintained in the Artemis system covered by the Privacy Act; System Location to include NHTSA's current address and the location of the Start Printed Page 17235Federal disaster recovery facility in Stennis, MS; System Managers to update the name and contact information for the system's current points of contact; Authority for Maintenance of the System to reflect the system's underlying authority; Purposes to provide clarity and facilitate understanding of NHTSA investigation and recall processes; Categories of Records to provide greater clarity of the type of records and information included in the system; Record Source Categories to provide additional information about the mechanisms used by NHTSA for collecting records in the system; and Routine Uses to modify an existing routine use to permit sharing of records with manufacturers named in VOQs earlier in NHTSA's investigation and recall processes than permitted under the previously published system of records notice (SORN), unless a consumer “opts-out” at the time of collection, and to provide additional details and clarification about NTHSA referrals of complaints to other agencies; and Policies and Practices for Storage, Retrieval, Retention and Disposal of Records, respectively, to provide additional information about the location of the system, methods of retrieval, individuals permitted to retrieve records, and to specify the applicable NARA record retention schedule; Administration, Technical and Physical Safeguards to detail the privacy-risk mitigating controls applicable to the system. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify and clarify the language, formatting, and text of the previously published notice to align with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget Memoranda A-108. This updated system, Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) System, will be included in the Department of Transportation's inventory of record systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, NHTSA proposes to update, reissue, and rename a previously published DOT system of records titled, “Department of Transportation—DOT/NHTSA 415 Artemis/Vehicle Owner Complaint Information.” The updated system of records consists of VOQs submitted by or on behalf of consumers.
Under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301, NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation (ODI), is responsible for identifying, investigating and ensuring the remedy, through safety recalls conducted by manufacturers, of safety-related defects and non-compliance issues in motor vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment. To accomplish this, ODI collects and evaluates information from several different sources: Consumers, motor vehicle and equipment manufacturers, State and local law enforcement, insurance companies, automobile dealers, advocacy groups, and other entities. Among the types of information collected by ODI are VOQs that can be submitted through NHTSA's website https://www.NHTSA.gov, through a telephone hotline where an operator inputs the consumer's information into an electronic form, or a hard copy form sent to NHSTA by mail. ODI also receives letters from consumers and their Congressional representatives communicating vehicle and equipment concerns that the Agency, in addition to or in place of the questionnaire form. This system enables NHTSA to facilitate the defect investigation and recall processes, which may include contacting consumers regarding their complaints or recalls affecting their vehicle. ODI relies on the Advanced Retrieval (Tire, Equipment, Motor Vehicles) Information System (ARTEMIS) to provide centralized storage, document management and data analysis tools for all information collected in support of the defect investigation process, including VOQs. NHTSA uses the information in this system to help the Agency identify, investigate and ensure that manufactures remedy, through recall, replacement or repair, (1) potential safety defects and failures to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) in motor vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment, and (2) problems with the scope, administration, notification or remedy of a recall. NHTSA also may use the email addresses and Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) collected, to contact consumers whose vehicles are the subject of VOQs, and to notify consumers via email of open recalls applicable to the vehicles or equipment referenced in their VOQs.
Changes to the System Name, System Location, System Managers, Authority, Purpose, Categories of Individuals Covered by the System, Categories of Records in the System, Record Source Categories, Policies and Practices for Storage, Retrieval, Retention and Disposal of Records, and Safeguards improve transparency, but do not reflect substantive changes to the Notice. In particular, NHTSA's change to the System Name is intended to clarify for members of the public that only VOQs (as defined above) and not all documents stored in ARTEMIS, are part of the VOQ Privacy Act system of records that is the subject of this notice.
Changes to the SORN include:
1. System Name to Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) System to appropriately identify the specific records maintained in the Artemis system covered by the Privacy Act;Start Printed Page 17236
2. System Location to include NHTSA's current address and the location of the Federal disaster recovery facility in Stennis, MS;
3. System Managers to update the name and contact information for the system's current points of contact;
4. Authority for Maintenance of the System to reflect the system's underlying authority;
5. Purposes to provide clarity and facilitate understanding of NHTSA investigation and recall processes;
6. Categories of Records to provide greater clarity of the type of records and information included in the system;
7. Record Source Categories to provide additional information about the mechanisms used by NHTSA for collecting records in the system;
8. Routine Uses to modify an existing routine use to permit sharing of records with manufacturers named in VOQs earlier in NHTSA's investigation and recall processes than permitted under the previously published SORN, unless a consumer “opts-out” at the time of collection;
9. Routine uses to replace a general routine use permitting NHTSA to refer complaints to other state or federal agencies with three separate routines uses specifying that NHTSA may share consumer complaints with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in connect with NTSB investigations of surface transportation incidents, and highway accidents and incidents including those at railway grade crossings; to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to support enforcement of consumer product safety laws; to the Federal Trade Commission in matters involving potential unfair or deceptive practices;
10. Routine uses to add a routine use permitting NHTSA to share with the Department of Homeland Security consumer complaints indicative of a cybersecurity vulnerability impacting critical infrastructure;
11. Routine Uses to remove internal uses of the information in the VOQ by ODI which are more appropriately addressed in the system's Purpose.
12. Policies and Practices for Storage, Retrieval, Retention and Disposal of Records, respectively, to provide additional information about the location of the system, methods of retrieval, individuals permitted to retrieve records, and to specify the applicable NARA record retention schedule;
13. Administration, Technical and Physical Safeguards to detail the privacy-risk mitigating controls applicable to the system.
14. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify and clarify the language, formatting, and text of the previously published notice to align with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget Memoranda A-108. This updated system, Vehicle Owner Questionnaire (VOQ) System, will be included in the Department of Transportation's inventory of record systems.
NHTSA routinely publishes VOQs without personally identifiable information (PII) on its public facing website. A critical piece of information included in a VOQ is the VIN. A VIN is coded information that a vehicle manufacturer assigns to each vehicle it produces. This code contains seventeen alphanumeric characters that provide information about the vehicle. The first eleven characters identify the manufacturer and various generic attributes of the vehicle, such as the make, model, model year, body style, engine type, wheel base, supplemental restraint system and production plant, etc. The last six characters are the number sequentially assigned by the manufacturer in the production process. This sequential number is the part of the VIN that identifies a specific vehicle such as build history, standard or optional equipment packages and service history (and makes it possible through a search of public records to determine the identity of the owner). Because the VIN provides significant data, a VIN is critical to NHTSA's and a manufacturer's assessment and evaluation of potential safety issues in motor vehicles. NHTSA publishes the first eleven characters of the seventeen characters of VIN because, without the last six characters, the VIN cannot be linked to an individual. The public, including vehicle equipment manufacturers, can view these complaints with the truncated VIN and access the general make, model, model year attributes of the vehicle. Without the full seventeen character VIN, a manufacturer is unable to identify the precise vehicle that has experienced a potential safety related defect. Without such information, a manufacturer is unable to learn of vehicle specific information and focus on or identify potential safety issues.
The previously published SORN permitted NHTSA to share PII, including the full VIN, in VOQs with the manufacturer of the vehicle or equipment identified in a VOQ only after the agency has opened a formal investigation or a manufacturer has commenced a recall. In NHTSA's view, providing manufacturers and other stakeholders earlier access to PII in VOQs is critical to improving highway safety because earlier access will help manufacturers to identify the specific vehicle and its attributes that is subject to the complaint and remedy safety defects and noncompliance issues in a more timely manner than under the previously published SORN. Modifying this routine use will permit NHTSA to share VOQs with manufacturers on a routine basis as soon as is practicable after receipt by the Agency. Sharing these records at an earlier stage than permitted under the previously published SORN is compatible with the original vehicle safety purposes of the system because it allows NHTSA to provide manufacturers with information necessary to definitively identify the build history, equipment options, and repair history of a vehicles identified in a VOQ, and to identify, investigate and work with NHTSA to remedy a potential safety defect, failure to comply with an FMVSS or recall administration, scope or remedy issue.
To limit the potential privacy risks of sharing consumer contact information with manufacturer of the vehicles or equipment identified in the VOQ, NHTSA updated its collection instrument (see 2127-0008) to include explicit opt-out. Consumers who choose to opt-out will not have their information shared with the manufacturer of the vehicles or equipment identified in the VOQs unless the Agency opens an investigation or a recall is initiated. The Agency takes consumer privacy seriously and has included this new “opt out” feature in the VOQ form in order to provide consumers with additional control over their personal information. To enhance transparency, the “opt-out” appears in a prominent place in the electronic form maintained on the Department's public website, and will be communicated to consumers by hotline operators at the end of each hotline call. If consumers, at the point and time of collection, either check an “opt out” box on the VOQ form or direct the hotline operator collecting their information over the telephone to do so, NHTSA will not share with manufacturers the personal information provided in response to VOQ questions unless the Agency opens up a defect investigation or a recall takes place. At that point, an existing routine use permits the Agency to share their VOQs with the manufacturer of the vehicles or equipment identified in the VOQs. In addition to the approximately 70,000 VOQs filed annually directly with NHTSA, the Agency also receives approximately 1500 letters per year Start Printed Page 17237from consumers or consumers' Congressional representatives communicating vehicle and equipment concerns that the Agency may convert into VOQs. It is not practicable for NHTSA to provide this small subset of consumers with the opportunity to “opt out” of sharing their personal information with the manufacturer of the vehicles or equipment identified in their letters. For this reason, NHTSA will pursue a privacy-positive course of action and assign “opt-out” status to the VOQs generated from these letters. NHTSA will not share their personal information with the manufacturer of the vehicles or equipment identified in these letters unless the Agency opens a defect investigation or a recall is commenced.
To further enhance transparency, NHTSA is adding a routine use concerning comments received in the free form narrative section of the web based VOQ form and VOQs received through the hotline. The publicly available VOQs are on NHTSA's website, accessed through NHTSA.gov. As part of the online VOQ form, NHTSA has a free text narrative section that requests that the consumer “In your own words, tell us what happened.” NHTSA provides notice to the consumer that any text submitted will be made public without edits. Once the individual submits the online form, NHTSA publishes these comments without edit and other non-personal identifying information in the VOQ to NHTSA's public website. In order to advise the public how NHTSA uses the narrative comments in a VOQ, NTHSA is establish a routine use this system of records. This routine use is compatible with the purpose of collection, which is to provide the public with information concerning potential safety related defects and noncompliance with a federal motor vehicle safety standard.
Finally, NHTSA is replacing pre-existing, generally-worded, routine use that permits NTHSA to share consumer complaints with “appropriate State or Federal agenc[ies] for actions involving matters of law or regulation beyond the responsibility” of NHSTA with three separate routine uses that specify the agencies with and purposes for which NHTSA shares information. This does not reflect a change in the types of disclosures NTSHA has or will make under the routine use, but is merely intended to provide clarity and transparency into how NHTSA shares information with other agencies. NHTSA also is updating its routine uses to permit disclosure to DHS when the consumer complaint evidences a potential cybersecurity vulnerability impacting transportation critical infrastructure. These routine uses are compatible with the purpose of the collection as a “necessary and proper” use of the information, as discussed more below. Individuals who provide VOQ information to NHTSA do so because they are seeking Federal agency intervention to address a potential issue with their vehicle. When the potential issue relates to a matter outside of NHTSA's jurisdiction, individuals may expect that NHTSA will share the information with the Federal agencies having jurisdiction for the matter. Thus, this routine use with compatible with the purpose of the collection, which is to identify, investigate and remedy potential safety defects.
NHTSA is updating this Notice to include Departmental general routine uses previously incorporated by reference, to the extent that they are compatible with the purposes of this System. As recognized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its Privacy Act Implementation Guidance and Responsibilities (65 FR 19746, July 9, 1975), the routine uses include all proper and necessary uses of information in the system, even if such uses occur infrequently. NHTSA has included in this Notice general routine uses for disclosures to law enforcement when the record, on its face, indicates a violation of law, to DOJ for litigation purposes, or when necessary in investigating or responding to a breach of this system or other agencies' systems. NHTSA must work with DOT to take appropriate action to address any apparent violations of the law, and to share information with legal counsel in the Department of Justice when necessary for litigation. OMB has long recognized that these types of routine uses are “proper and necessary” uses of information and qualify as compatible with agency systems. 65 FR 19476. In addition, by OMB Memorandum M-17-12, OMB directed agencies to include routine uses that will permit sharing of information when needed to investigate, respond to, and mitigate a breach of a Federal information system. NHTSA also has included routine uses that permit sharing with the National Archives and Records Administration when necessary for an inspection, to any Federal government agency engaged in audit or oversight related to this system, or when DOT determines that the disclosure will detect, prevent, or mitigate terrorism activity. These types of disclosures are necessary and proper uses of information in this system because they further DOT's obligation to fulfil its records management and program management responsibilities by facilitating accountability to agencies charged with oversight in these areas, and the Department's obligation under Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law 108-456, and Executive Order 13388 (Oct. 25, 2005) to share information necessary and relevant to detect, prevent, disrupt, preempt, or mitigate the effects of terrorist activities against the territory, people, and interests of the United States.
Finally, this system includes a routine use to permit sharing with our contractors, consultants, experts, grantees, and others when necessary to fulfill a NHTSA function related to this System. Agencies routinely engage assistance of these types of individuals in the fulfillment of their duties, such as contract support necessary to maintain the database in which these records are housed. NHTSA relies on contract support to maintain this system, and disclosures for this purpose are compatible with the purpose of the collection.
