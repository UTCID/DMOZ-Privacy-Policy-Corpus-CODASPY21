Platform PRIVACY STATEMENT
This privacy statement covers Platform. Because Platform wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices: What personally identifiable information Platform collects, what personally identifiable information third parties collect through the Web site, what organization collects the information, how Platform uses the information, with whom Platform may share user information, what choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information, what types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Platform control, and how users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact Platform Customer Support via the online contact form mentioned at the bottom of the page.
Information Collection and Use
Platform is the sole owner of the information collected on Platform. However, information voluntarily submitted to forms on Platform will be shared with other companies in order to serve our customers. This information may be shared with and/or sold to one or several contractors or third party providers, as well as companies contracted to work with Platform for the purposes of lead qualification/verification. Platform may also use user information internally to present other relevant offers to our users.
Platform collects information from our users at several different points:
Landing Pages
Users entering This Site from external websites through creative including widgets, ad banners, ad text, or any other advertising creative may be directed to signup-form landing pages. These landing pages may serve a variety of purposes, including collecting user information for the purpose of being passed on to qualified home services installation partners or home services lead aggregators, offering free home service estimates in exchange for the user’s email address, or other variations on this theme. Users of Platform ALWAYS have a choice to participate and submit their information onto Platforms web forms.
Registration
In order to use some features of This Website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide contact information (such as name and email address) as well as certain information regarding a user’s home and energy usage. Platform may use this information to contact the user, via email, direct mail or telephone, about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. Platform may provide this contact information to contractors and other third party service providers and home improvement lead aggregators who can help fulfill your information/service request.
Third Party Communications
As stated above, Platform may provide the user’s contact information to contractors and to other third party service providers and home improvement lead aggregators who can help fulfill the user’s information/service request. Accordingly, these third parties may directly contact the user (via email, direct marketing, or telemarketing) about (i) the user’s information/service requests through Platform and/or (ii) their own products and services. Please see the Opt-out section for how to opt out of receiving these communications.
Profile
We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users detailing their home improvement project preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide the quote service and improve the content of Platform for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s service from Platform and may be used to direct pertinent Platform marketing promotions to them. We may share your profile with third party service providers in order to enhance your user experience and our services.
Cookie Disclosure
What’s a cookie?
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time.
Why do we use cookies?
Platform uses cookies to restore users to a previous session after leaving Platform. By setting a cookie on our site, we are able to save the information and settings provided by the user in an earlier session even if they have not registered.
Deleting cookies
If the user has not registered with Platform, deleting cookies means that the user may be unable to restore information from a previous session. There are a number of software and shareware programs available that are designed to periodically purge cookie files from the user’s hard disk. We do not recommend these applications and, as such, cannot address any resulting support issues that may be related to the use of these programs.
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/ time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer Platform, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Special Offers and Updates
We send users email notifications of various events relating to the use of Platform. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and/or a newsletter. During the sign up process, we do present the option note to receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
Email
If a user wishes to subscribe to our emails, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users, we provide a way to unsubscribe from/opt-out of these communications in each message we send.
Service Announcements
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if The Website’s service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
Customer Service
Platform may communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user’s wishes.
Legal Disclaimer
Though Platform makes every effort to preserve user privacy, Platform may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Platform.
Sharing of Information
Platform does not sell or otherwise disclose information about our website visitors, except as described here. Platform may share the information you provide with contractors and other third party service providers and lead aggregators in order to help fulfill your information/service request. Please note that these third parties with whom Platform shares your information may (i) use such personal information for their own purposes (including commercial purposes) as set forth in their respective privacy policies or (ii) may disclose or dispose of your information to other third parties in the course of their own business. Users may opt out of this use by contacting these third parties directly. The opt-out terms for these third parties will be governed by their respective privacy policies. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity or (ii) if this is necessary to protect the vital interests of Platform or a person.
Business Transitions
In the event Platform goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be a part of the assets transferred.
Widget Tracking
We may use third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our services. We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.
We may also use third party redirects, which will redirect you through a third party server before redirecting to the final landing page. On this redirect, the third party may place its own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device (e.g., for purposes of retargeting) and collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.
Choice/Opt-out
Platform’s users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information.
Users who no longer wish to receive Platform’s emails and/or promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” links present on all communication sent from Platform.
Upon a user’s request, Platform can (i) provide the user with a list of all the companies to whom we have provided your contact information pursuant to Platform and (ii) provide the user the categories of information shared with the third parties. Although the user’s information may be submitted to a contractor or third party immediately after the user’s information is submitted, the user may opt-out from future information sharing or additional contact from Platform by emailing us directly at thomas@contractorquotes.us. Note if the user’s information has already been shared with a contractor or third-party, the user will have to opt out by contacting each contractor or third party directly (or opt out upon receiving communication from them). Platform will make a good faith effort to assist the user in this request. Please note that this service is free to the consumer; however, we are only required by law to respond to one request per year.
If the user receives a commercial email from one of our third parties, the user may be able to unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of each email. If the user wants to opt-out from all communications from these third parties, the user may opt out of this use by contacting these third parties directly.
Links
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Platform, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time Platform requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used [shared with the contest [survey] sponsors] to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties.

Platform will automatically send the friend an mail inviting them to visit Platform. Platform does store this information for the sole purpose of sending emails and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” links present on all communication sent from Platform.
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can be done by responding to emails we send out or emailing our Customer Support at thomas@contractorquotes.us.
Notification of Changes
If Platform decides to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places Platform deem appropriate so Platform’s users are always aware of what information Platform collects, how Platform use it, and under what circumstances, if any, Platform disclose it. Platform will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
In some cases where Platform post a notice Platform will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from Platform, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
