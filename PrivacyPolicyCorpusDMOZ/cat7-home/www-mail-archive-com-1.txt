How can I archive a public list?
If you are a Google Groups administrator, please directly subscribe
archive+gg1@mail-archive.com. For Yahoo Groups, please use
yahoo@mail-archive.com.
Otherwise subscribe archive@mail-archive.com
to the mailing list. Contact
us for help if needed.
Are you the list administrator?
Yes: The Mail Archive does not
respond to "confirmation requests". You should add the subscription
such that a confirmation is not required.
No: go to
the subscription confirmation
page, find the confirmation message, and follow the instructions.
IMPORTANT: The Mail Archive will create a publicly readable archive.
The Mail Archive merely provides an archival forum for mailing lists.
The Mail Archive does not necessarily agree or endorse any particular viewpoint posted to a mailing list.
The Mail Archive exercises no editorial control unless required by applicable law.
The Mail Archive automatically detects when it receives
mail from a new list. Thus, you are encouraged, although
certainly not required, to send a test message to the
newly archived list. If you are adding several lists to
the archive, send a separate and distinct test message to
each one.
Will this service work for my list?
10 years of growth
Almost certainly. We require that the name of the list be
present somewhere in the email headers. Almost all mailing
lists do this automatically. For example, when people send
mail to the list foobar@jab.org, the name of the list
shows up prominently in the To: header as
well as other places. A few lists do funny tricks with
email headers, and try to hide the name of the
list. Spammers are notorious for forging and hiding
headers. Sometimes even legitimate lists will try to hide
the listname. This is most common when the list is for
one-to-many communications, as opposed to many-to-many
communications. Any list that mangles email headers to
hide its name is incompatible with the service and will
not be archived. We do not archive lists whose name does
not begin with a letter. We've found that list names
beginning with numbers or unusual punctuation are almost
always noise, i.e. unsolicited commercial email or
spam. The illustration shows growth (one year per ring) of
some major users of The Mail Archive.
Can I delete a message from the archive?
List administrators may remove any message from their
list.
In addition, any poster may request removal of
messages that that they themselves have written without
having to get administrator approval.
Deletion requests
for messages written by another user (including messages
where an individual’s public post may have been quoted by
someone else) will require list administrator approval.
We feel this policy strikes a balance between respect for
individual privacy and respect for the concept of public
mailing lists and open public discussion. Removal requests
should be sent to our support address
themailarchive@gmail.com.
How do I contact a list administrator?
We do not know the contact information for the mailing
list administrators.
Most mailing list services have a
"-owner" address where you can reach the list admin (for
example, if the list is gossip@mail-archive.com then the list admin
can likely be reached at gossip-owner@jab.org).
We
maintain an automated web page for each mailing list that
may contain the List Owner's contact information.
You can
reach this page by going to "info.html" on the list
archive.
For example, if the list is gossip@mail-archive.com, then
you can go
to http://www.mail-archive.com/gossip@mail-archive.com/info.html. If
none of the above works, you will need to search for the
website that hosts the mailing list, or post a question to
the mailing list.
Where can I discuss the The Mail Archive's service?
The public mailing list gossip was
created for informal support or discussion amongst users
of the archiving service. Only subscribers
may post.
NOTE: The gossip@mail-archive.com list is strictly for
discussions related to the mail-archive.com service, AND
ONLY the mail-archive.com service. Messages related to the
content archived on The Mail Archive are NOT appropriate
for the list and will be ignored.
Examples of appropriate topics for gossip@mail-archive.com:
My list does not show up in the archives.
List messages are not getting archived.
Searching is not working.
...
We also have a support team.
What is your privacy policy?
The Mail Archive does not solicit personal information,
does not try to identify individual visitors, and does not
send out junk email. We comply with internet standard
email headers which restrict or prohibit archiving. System
logs record server activity, including IP addresses of
visiting computers. These logs are stored for a limited
time (less than 90 days) and used for troubleshooting,
aggregate statistics, and performance tuning
only. Advertisements are governed by the advertising
agency's
privacy
policy, please consider installing advertisement
blocking for your web
browser. Questions regarding privacy issues should be sent
to the support
team. See also Can I delete
a message from the archive?
What about spamming?
Do not send unsolicited commercial email to any mailing
list or individual in the archive. Spamming is expressly
forbidden, and also illegal. The service is based in
California, USA which has anti-spam laws, including
California Penal Code Section 502 (added by Assembly Bill
1629 (1998), approved by Governor September 26, 1998),
California Business and Professions Code, Division 7, Part
3, Chapter 1, Article 1.8 (added by S.B 186 (2003),
approved September 23, 2003). We consider spammers a very
serious threat to mailing lists, archiving and internet
communication in general. The Mail Archive despises spam
and will never send unsolicited email to any list or list
member for any reason.
The Mail Archive utilizes two levels of electronic
countermeasures to prevent spam incidents. First, we
explicitly block spam harvesting robots (spambots) from
accessing our server. We deny access, at the server level,
for any software that matches the browser ID of a known
spambot. Our second line of defense is to make sure that
the web pages themselves are spambot resistant. We do not
use any unshielded mailto: hyperlinks, email
addresses and we strip out, scramble, or obfuscate email
addresses from message headers and bodies. Yet we still
provide a way for people to reply to an archived message,
using their regular email software. This feat is achieved
with a special POST protected CGI gateway which returns a
mailto: URL to the user agent. This technique
is extremely effective in blocking generic spam harvesting
robots; for more information, see
Mullane's Spambot
Beware guide. The effectiveness of our spam-blocking
preventative measures are monitored by spambot trap
addresses like honeypot@jab.org and
many others.
Despite all these steps, recognize that any time an email
address is exposed on the internet, obfuscated or
otherwise, spammers could potentially abuse it. Open
mailing lists are vulnerable to spam attacks. Thus there
is some risk associated with using The Mail Archive, and
we do not assume any legal liability for
spammers. Suggestions or feedback regarding privacy or
anti-spamming enhancements are appreciated.
Why is there spam in the archive?
Any spam that finds it way into The Mail Archive is coming
from an evil spammer sending their garbage to the mailing
list. Spam appearing in the archive is not coming from us
and never would. We apply an inbound spam filtering
service to remove spam before it ever gets to us, to
minimize the problem. If you would a specific piece of
spam removed, please contact
our support
team.
What guarantees do you provide?
None! There are no quality of service guarantees. We work
very hard to keep the service running smoothly, but we
cannot provide any guarantees.
The Mail Archive has been running since 1998. Archiving
services are planned to continue indefinitely. We do not
plan on ever needing to remove archived material. Do not,
however, misconstrue these intentions with a warranty of
any kind.
We reserve the right to discontinue service at
any time.
And yes, we regularly backup data just in case something
goes wrong.
What is the search syntax?
Searches span all archived messages in a particular
mailing list. More complex searches are supported through
advanced query syntax. Phrase search is supported. So are
fancy boolean operators like + - AND OR NOT
(). Finally, searches can be limited to a
particular email field such as from,
date, subject or
message. For example, one can find all
messages from April 2002.
The sort order can be controlled
by adding sort:newest or sort:oldest
to your search string.
"battle royale"
+Jeff -Breidenbach -Marshall
(dualing OR dueling) AND banjos
from:"Mac Oglesby"
date:[19980101 TO 19981231] Breidenbach
date:200204*
help sort:newest
To place a search form on a web page, use the following HTML.
Don't forget to replace gossip@mail-archive.com with the listname of interest.
<form action="/search" method=get>
<input type="hidden" name="l" value="gossip@mail-archive.com">
<input type=text name="q" value="" size=25>
</form>
The North American Sundial Society published an
excellent reference
document describing search in more detail. Very advanced users may
also wish to read
the Lucene
documentation, noting The Mail Archive defaults to the AND conjunction
operator.
Do you have message-id search?
Sure, you can search right from the homepage. Advanced
users who wish to programmatically search for a RFC2822
Message-Id may use this form as an example. We also have a
hyperlink example.
Message-Id:
e.g. 9dc4201d0807272359r1f0ad9d6ta44f31f439de58b7@mail.gmail.com
How can I import existing archives?
By far the easiest way to import messages into The Mail
Archive is via an mbox
file. First make sure the archive is started, then
contact our support
team if you have an mbox file you wish to import. Advanced
users may find an email conversion utility useful for Eudora, MH, IMAP,
maildir, YahooGroups,
and the ever popular broken
mbox files that don't have >From quoting. Mailman users
who already have gzip'd
text or mbox archives online can just supply a URL. Please
don't even think about forwarding old messages directly to the
archival address. First, there's an excellent chance they will
be eaten by a spam filter. Second, unless you really really
know what you are doing, the forwarding process will add extra
headers to the message, which will confuse the sorting
software and the messages will not archive correctly.
Messages don't show up.
Some email messages specifically request not to be
archived. Any messages bearing the header
X-No-Archive: yes will not be archived by
this service.
My list splits into multiple archives.
Sometimes a mailing list will have multiple email
address. For example, a list might use both
"adorable@odc.com" and "adorable@vorlon.odc.com". When The
Mail Archive automatically sorts incoming email, it has to
figure out that both email addresses are actually for the
same list. It looks (rather thoroughly) for clues in the
email headers to do this sorting; usually this works very
well.
Sometimes, however, it can be difficult or impossible by
just looking at headers to know that two email addresses
really belong to the same list. For example, when email
comes from "mhonarc@ncsa.edu" and "mhonarc@rosat.de" it is
tough to know, automatically, if that is one list or
two. If you run a list, and are experiencing this problem,
add a header such as x-mailing-list:
mhonarc@rosat.de to each and every email (as many
lists currently do). This blatant clue will give the
automatic sorting program all the hints it needs.
Do you support RSS?
Yes. Each list has an associated RSS feed. The feed
provides metadata for syndication purposes - typically
websites who wish to link to the most recent messages in a
particular archive. The RSS lives at the fixed location
<LISTURL>/maillist.xml. For example, the
gossip@mail-archive.com RSS file would be located at http://www.mail-archive.com/gossip@mail-archive.com/maillist.xml.
Additionally, we maintain a master list of all active RSS
feeds in OPML format.
Do you support multiple languages (i18n/l10n)?
The Mail Archive will handle email in any language. By
default, an archive's localization will be in
English. That means you will see English language labels
like "Search" or "earlier messages" even if the message
itself is not in English. To request a different
localization, use the menu on the archive's info
page. Currently supported localizations include
Arabic,
Catalan,
Chinese,
Czech,
Danish,
Dutch,
English,
French,
Galician,
German,
Greek,
Hebrew,
Hungarian,
Indonesian,
Italian,
Japanese,
Korean,
Lithuanian,
Norwegian,
Polish,
Portugese,
Romanian,
Russian,
Serbian,
Spanish,
Swedish,
Tamil,
Turkish,
Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese.
It is very easy to add a new localization. Translate the
following words to your language and send the results to
the support
team. It is much more important to make sense in context
and sound good than to provide a literal translation.

Can I customize the look and feel of my list's pages?
Yes.
It is very easy to brand an archive with a custom
logo. Logo
images may be submitted on the archive's info
page. The maximum allowed size of a logo is 300 pixels
wide by 50 pixels tall; larger images will be automatically
downscaled.
How can I change an archive's info page?
QR code
Each archive has
an infomation page
describing the list. For example, the information page
might say how to a user can subscribe or unsubscribe to a
list, or reference alternate archives. There is also a
field called "hints" which allows one to add keywords
describing the list. While some fields can be directly
edited from the webpage, most fields are generated
automatically based
on standard
email headers sent with list messages. To update this
information, the list administrator must adjust settings
on the list server software; consult the documentation for
the list server software for details. Not all list server
software has the ability to set or adjust these headers
although it is becoming increasingly common. The
information page also contains a QR Code. People with
fancy mobile phones can take a picture of this barcode and
directly access the corresponding archive without any typing.
How can I download all or part of an archive?
You can use any website mirroring tool to download an
archive in HTML format to your local computer. Please
don't hammer The Mail Archive's servers too hard; do not
request more than one page a second, do not try to
download millions of web pages. Most importantly, do not
abuse a list archive content in any way shape or form; if
in doubt please check with the list admin first. The Mail
Archive usually keeps a copy of the raw email messages as
well, but they are not web accessible. This is mostly to
prevent address harvesting by spammers. However, we also
sometimes move older raw messages to cold storage since
they are not actively used.
Sometimes the list admin
needs access to the raw messages, for example to export to
another archive. We'll accommodate such requests when
practical.
Do you handle high volume lists?
We accept lists that get tens of messages per day. Only
the most recent 3000 messages are available via date or
thread indexes. Everything should be accessable via the
search engine.
Do you archive attachments?
Currently image attachments and excessively large
attachments of any sort are unlikely to be archived. It is
possible that in the future, no attachments of any sort
will be archived.
How good is message threading?
Threading usually works very well, but occasionally there
is a hiccup. For example, one might see two different
topics threaded together. Usually this occurs when a
message author hits reply to a message in one topic, but
manually changes the subject line to match another topic.
When this happens, the threading subsystem has to decide
whether to track "who replied to what", or to track the
subject line. The Mail Archive goes with the former
because that is usually more reliable. For more
information about threading and the special email headers
that get inserted into a message whenever you hit reply,
see the MHonArc FAQ
entry.
How is the service performing?
Historical and current uptime statistics are available
starting 2005. We typically have an annual uptime
somewhere around 99.7%
every year.

Total uptime:
archiving latency over last 24 hours
Archiving latency can vary dramatically. First, The Mail
Archive has a never ending capacity battle. More and more
people use the service, slowing down archiving
performance. We upgrade the software and hardware to keep
pace, improving performance. Second, under high load the
service gracefully switches over to a more efficient batch
mode, which means that many messages are processed at a
time, not necessarily in the order received. Archiving
latency is an important metric and under typical operating
conditions messages appear in the archives within minutes
of receipt. However, performance depends greatly on
message traffic patterns. The graph shows how many
messages are piled up and waiting in the service's inbox
at any given time.
HTTP queries per second
HTTPS queries per second
The Mail Archive has not experienced any major problems
with serving capacity and we don't foresee near term
problems. Most computational resources are
spent up front during archiving time. So far we we have
no trouble keeping up with both users, and the
ravenous web crawlers from the global search engines. And
they sure are ravenous! The unique IP address count should provide
a rough idea of human visitors, while the graphs describe
overall traffic.

How can my organization partner with The Mail Archive?
The Mail Archive works with a number of organizations to
provide primary or secondary list archives. For example,
some organizations run a large number of mailing lists and
systematically archive everything on this service. Contact
the support
team for assistance or discussion. Users of the mailman
list server software on Linux may want to use the
following script as a starting point.
# cd /var/lib/mailman/lists
# echo archive@mail-archive.com > /tmp/foo
# ls | xargs -n 1 add_members -r /tmp/foo
Why is it free? What's the business plan?
The Mail Archive was a creation of Jeff Breidenbach in
1998 and run for six years as a personal hobby
project. Jeff Marshall joined in 2004 and the service
ran as an advertisement supported small business through
2018. As of 2019 the service has returned to hobby status.
Do you give back to the community?

What is your engineering philosophy?
"gen8" undergoes hardware testing
For hardware, The Mail Archive primarily utilizes an
x86-64 architecture server attached to high speed RAID
disk array with a multi-terabyte raw capacity. The server
is housed in California in a professionally managed
datacenter, including battery buffered power, high speed
network connect, and high clue network administrators. Our
preferred server vendor is
Ashford Computer Consulting Service.
For software, the service utilizes best of breed Free
Software programs running under the Ubuntu
operating system. Application software includes the Apache web server, MHonArc archiving
software, and PyLucene
search library. Both the core OS and the Ubuntu
application collection are automatically upgraded on a
daily basis against distribution bug fixes and security
patches. We contribute directly to the maintenance of key
packages
at the Linux distribution level.
A custom design element of The Mail Archive is the sorting
system. List mail comes into a single address and is
automatically separated. The competing approach would be
to provide a separate email address to each list, and then
let the MTA and SMTP infrastructure do the work. The Mail
Archive's sort-based design is partly historical (it was
derived from personal email filters), partly intellectual
(the challenge of making a great sorting algorithm), and
partly user oriented (it's a little easier from the user's
perspective to work with a fixed address). The purely
technical downsides of using a sort algorithm is
computational cost and complexity, especially with respect
to crossposts. And it can be a challenge when lists that
migrate from server to server or widely fluctuate their
headers.
The graphic layout and general look-and-feel of the website
was done by
Russ
Weakley
from Max
Design. Russ performed most of The Mail Archive's site
design, first in 2004 and more recently in 2012 with a
redesign of the message pages.
Any shortcomings in the
site's design are ours alone, however, as we alter the
design.
We highly recommended Russ if you are looking for
a great design experience.
How can list servers integrate better?
If you program list server software, first and foremost
please support RFC2369. If you are interested in tighter
integration with The Mail Archive, we'd love to be an
explicit configuration option. User interface is important;
the option should be easy for list administrators to invoke
but not cause confusion or accidents. The option must add
archive@mail-archive.com as a subscriber to the list. It may
make archive@mail-archive.com immune from automatic
unsubscribe mechanisms and ban it from posting. It may add
the RFC2369 header List-Archive:
<http://www.mail-archive.com/gossip@mail-archive.com>
with gossip@mail-archive.com replaced by the posting address used in
the List-Post header. It may add a reference to the archive
in the message footer.
_______________________________________________
Gossip mailing list
http://www.mail-archive.com/gossip@mail-archive.com
For fancy integration, you can make a live hyperlink to
the archive in the footer. You can do this using the
message-id.

http://mid.mail-archive.com/e332889b0807292221r2aea3975l3d6f66848d13b279@mail.gmail.com
For really fancy integration (maybe too fancy), you can
add a hashed reference archive message in the footer. We
also recommend transmitting the URL via an RFC5064 header,
such as Archived-At:
<http://go.mail-archive.com/6B4LX8klSXjr7Ot_gvb6ZkUybHI=>.
This python implementation demonstrates the hash
calculation used by The Mail Archive.
