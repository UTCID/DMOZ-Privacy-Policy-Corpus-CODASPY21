Privacy Policy
It's quite simple from my personal perspective:-
My website is powered by Site Build It!
I don't collect e-mail addresses
Any information stored during the process of our communication is for my personal use.
I don't go around e-mail spamming people (not least because I don't have time).
The forum and any comments you submit are processed by the content 2 element of Site Build It!
I'm a barbecue enthusiast and the information on this site is here for your fun and enjoyment - I hope that you get both!

web browser to enable our system to recognize your browser.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have come to the
site for the first time, or have returned to a specific page. If you
personalize the site's pages, or register with any of our site's services, a
cookie enables barbecue-smoker-recipes.com to recall your specific information on
subsequent visits.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying settings in
your browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able
to fully experience the interactive features of the site.
A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a

bugs. They are commonly used by sites that use third-party services to monitor

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our website. These
companies use cookies and web beacons in their ads to ascertain how many times
you've seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give
us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally
identify you with that information from our website.
Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses the
