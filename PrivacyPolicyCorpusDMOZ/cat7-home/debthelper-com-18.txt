Refund Policy
If you cancel services before they are rendered you are entitled to a full refund. Once confirmation of your appointment is sent to your Payday Lender, the fee for the counseling services is non-refundable. If your title company sends in payment for your counseling or education fee after you have paid, you are entitled to a refund of the amount you paid for the appointment. Refunds are first returned in the manner in which they are paid. For example if you paid by debit card, your debit card will be refunded. If any situation occurs where the first method of payment becomes unavailable to credit, the billing department will determine how to return your payment to you. If services are rendered and you apply for a waiver or hardship, all or a portion of your fees may be eligible for a refund after receipt of good funds. If any portion of your payment to Us is already distributed to a third party on your behalf (such as paying your credit card debt to your creditor), those payments to us are non-refundable.
