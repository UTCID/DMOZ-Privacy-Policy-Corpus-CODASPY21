Testimonials
"These meetings with Sue have brought me clarity, have helped me set and accomplish business and personal goals, satisfaction of completion, but most of all “Time” to do some of things I enjoy doing. She has helped me stop the juggling act.""Sue’s book leaves no stone unturned, no question unanswered … Whether it’s stuff, time, perspective or plans, she presents clear, easy-to-follow suggestions and ideas that help the reader clarify what’s important and how to let go of the rest. … from a holistic standpoint, taking into account the emotional and relational factors that are so often at the core of our difficulties…."Her work is based on the recognition that our lives are a series of stages or chapters, and that each new stage has its own requirements for a successful and fulfilling transition. It can often feel like an overwhelming challenge to manage such transitions deliberately and mindfully. Sue’s robust and encouraging approach to this challenge makes it possible to break down and eliminate even the most daunting-looking obstacles." Kathryn May, MSW, Life Coach and Therapist"Our conversations made all the difference in my getting both an emotional and organizational grasp on the road map for sorting and moving.
Again, just having you to talk through the process with me made the difference I needed to focus and design a doable plan of attack. … my reframing the move to one of “going ahead” rather than “leaving behind” was the shift for emotional motivation I needed. Honestly, I’d still be stuck without having asked for help and reached out to you. The concept of roadmaps – and the other pearl of using the ladies room for a quiet place before speaking etc… will stick with me forever as GREAT tools!"“Sue West brings a librarian style sensibility to organizing while offering advice that is easily accessible to everyone….the art of reorganizing to suit your values and to help you through life transitions…. She emphasizes that there is no right or wrong way to organize. ….aims to overcome any fear individuals have about getting organized by encouraging small steps….She discusses organizing as an “ongoing process” and encourages communication among those who share living space to avoid unintentionally sabotaging any strides toward a more ordered household. … As an archives consultant who helps families create order for their personal papers, and as a former professional librarian, I recommend this book to anyone who bemoans lacking an innate sense of how to order their world.It is also helpful for those who need a new perspective to help rethink their possessions and to re-examine their sense of self to step comfortably into the future. Ms. West’s book will walk you through the steps you need to create an organizational system that works for you and makes you feel in control."Melissa Mannon, Archives and Cultural Heritage Consultant, ArchivesInfo“Instructor was compassionate, knowledgeable and encouraged participants to actively speak up and express themselves.
Extremely helpful in planning future goals.”"Working with Sue West is working with someone who is “all in!” Fully focused, engaged
and insightful is how I would describe our interactions. Sue is skillful in listening and providing the feedback that makes me want to take action! Getting unstuck is what I needed and I am very grateful for Sue’s expertise in removing the glue from my shoes!"What clients are sayingReviews for Organize for a Fresh StartPractical Strategies in Your InboxSubscribe to read practical strategies to common challenges, either as they're published or as a monthly summary.Read a sample | Sign up here!Blog CategoriesAD/HDBest of Blogs-Start HereBook Reviews for My BooksBusiness Organizing/Home OfficeChangeCommunicationsDecision MakingDownsize, RightsizeFinancesHolidaysHome OrganizationInterviews and Guest PostsLife "Balance"Papers and/or TechnologyProductivity OR ADHD Tips – Videos – 2 minutes eachSelf CareTime ManagementWorking on ProjectsADHD Self-Paced Workbook Save Printed workbook  Kindle version Coach Sue West Copyright © 2020 Website by Janet Barclay Privacy Policy
