Use of Cookies and Web Beacons

modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the

A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor
your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used
by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic.
They may be used in association with cookies to understand
how visitors interact with the pages and content on the
pages of a web site.
We may serve third party advertisements (such as, but not
limited to Google Adsense) that use cookies and
web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web
site to collect information.
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify
you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be
used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions
shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so
choose.
