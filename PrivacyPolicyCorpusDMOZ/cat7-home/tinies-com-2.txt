Privacy Notice
Tinies ("Tinies/we") is a recruitment business which provides work-finding services to you, our clients and childcarers ("you")
Tinies must process personal data (including sensitive personal data such as police records or health information) so that we can provide these services to you. Tinies knows that you care how information about you is used, shared and stored, and Tinies assures you that we will do so carefully and sensibly and always in accordance with UK Data Protection laws. You may give your personal details to Tinies directly, such as on an application or registration form, or via our website, or when speaking to a Tinies branch. Or we may collect data from another source such as a jobs board. Under UK law, Tinies must have a legal basis for processing your personal data once collected. For the purposes of providing you with childcare recruitment services or childcare training, we will only use your personal data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice. Tinies has never and will never sell your data to any third party. And we only share your data in accordance with this Privacy Notice and in order to provide our childcare recruitment services to you, or to provide you with childcare training (if you have indicated that you are interested in childcare training). For more information: Tinies Data Protection Policy 1. Collection and use of personal data A. Purpose of processing and legal basis Tinies will collect your personal data (which may include sensitive personal data) and will process your personal data for the purposes of providing you with childcare recruitment services or childcare training. The legal bases we rely upon to offer these services to you are: 1) Consent, where we ask you specific questions about processing your data; 2) Contractual obligation under our terms and conditions, ie we cannot perform the contract with you unless we process your data; and 3) In rare cases, a legal obligation (where we are required to pass on details to a regulatory authority such as Ofsted, DBS or LADO) B. Recipients of data Tinies will process and share your personal data and/or sensitive personal data with the following recipients: 1) Clients of Tinies: for example parents and nurseries who are looking for childcarers. 2) Childcarers of Tinies: if you are a client of Tinies and you are looking for a nanny, then we will have to share details of your job with our childcarers in order to find the best one for you. 3) Our IT company, Sapnagroup: Sapna run our database and organise the storage of our data. Sapna are required to abide by UK Data Protection Laws, and are trusted partners of Tinies. 4) My Family Care Limited ("MFC") the franchisor of Tinies and Bright Horizons Family Solutions Limited (the parent company) and their clients. Tinies is part of MFC and Bright Horizons, and provide emergency nannies to MFC and Bright Horizon clients. 5) Job boards: Tinies uses a number of job boards to advertise jobs and to search for childcarers, such as Reed, Total Jobs, Indeed, CV Library, Gumtree and other local and national job boards. 6) Training companies: if you have told us that you are interested in childcare training courses, then we will process and share your data with our affiliated training companies, including Tinies Training; Broaden HR, The Childcare Company, Flick Learning Ltd, EFAS Ltd and first aid training companies that Tinies uses to help childcarers get trained in Paediatric First Aid. 7) Regulatory Authorities: if we are required to do so, we may have to share your data with Ofsted, DBS, LADO or equivalent. Please also note that Tinies is a franchise business, with a number of Tinies branches operating throughout the UK. Each Tinies branch is a separate legal entity. Tinies branches may share data amongst themselves when carrying out their childcare recruitment services. C. Contractual requirement Your personal data is required to enable us to fulfil our obligations under our Terms and Conditions with you. We cannot offer or provide our childcare recruitment services or childcare training without having to take your data, process it and share it. You are obliged to provide the personal data under the contractual terms with Tinies but if you choose not to provide the data, we cannot perform any childcare requirement services for you, or provide information on childcare training courses. That means we cannot find you a job, for example, or find you a nanny. 2. Overseas If you are a childcarer looking for overseas nanny positions, Tinies may transfer your data to client families who live outside the European Economic Area ('EEA') for the purposes of providing you with overseas work. This would be necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Tinies to find you nanny work where you have specified that you wish to work overseas. 3. Data retention Tinies will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary, and as detailed below:
Different laws require us to keep different data for different periods of time. For example, if you are a childcarer registered with Tinies, the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, require us to keep work-seeker records for at least one year (a) from the date of their creation or (b) after the date on which we last provide you with work-finding services. If you work as a temp for Tinies or are pay-rolled by Tinies, we must also keep your payroll records, holiday pay, sick pay and pensions auto-enrolment records for as long as is legally required by HMRC and associated national minimum wage, social security and tax legislation (all of which we may be required to keep for 3 to 6 years). Other than the timescales listed above, and if you have registered with a Tinies branch, Tinies will retain your data for 6 years from the time when your registration with Tinies is no longer active. This means, for example, if you are a client, your data will be retained for 6 years from when we have found and placed a nanny with you and you no longer require our childcare recruitment services (which means we make your registration with Tinies inactive). Or if you are a childcarer, 6 years from when you have indicated that you are no longer looking for work and your registration with Tinies becomes inactive. 6 years is the time scale within which a client or childcarer of Tinies can bring a contractual claim against Tinies.† We will contact you before the 6 years comes up to check that you are happy for us to delete your data. If you wish us to keep your data for longer, then you can let us know when we contact you. In any case, you have a legal right to ask us to delete your data at any time by contacting Tinies or your local Tinies branch. If there is any safeguarding issue, or safeguarding allegation, we are obliged to keep your data indefinitely. If we are helping you with a training enquiry, or putting you in touch with a training provider, we will only keep your data for as long as it takes for you to complete your training, unless you have indicated that you would like to receive information on future training courses.
