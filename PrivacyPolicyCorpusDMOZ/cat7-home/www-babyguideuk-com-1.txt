Privacy policy
With the exception of user's IP
address, we, or any company that advertises on our site, do not collect
any personal identifying information about individuals except when
specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals on enquiry
forms etc.
Where a user has voluntarily supplied personally identifying information,
it may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and we
may share the information with companies that advertise on our site.
However, we do not pass on such information to anyone unconnected
to our site.
While we will seek to require companies that advertise on our site
to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility
for their actions. We will however, do all we can to assist in any
situation where a user's personally identifying information is passed
on to unconnected parties resulting in unsolicited messages being
received.
Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal
information (e.g. your name and e-mail address) on our discussion
forums or in the chat area, that information can be collected and
used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from unconnected
third parties. If you receive unsolicited or abusive e-mails as a
result of your participation in these areas of our website, please
forward them to abuse@babyguideuk.com
We will do all we can to assist the appropriate authorities and organisations
to identify and speak with the originators of such e-mails.
