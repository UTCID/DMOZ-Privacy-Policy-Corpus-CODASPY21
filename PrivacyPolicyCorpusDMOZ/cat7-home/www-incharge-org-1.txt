ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITH CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Mandatory Binding Individual Arbitration. Except as expressly provided below, you agree that any dispute, claim, case, or controversy (whether based in tort, contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, equity or any other legal theory) between you and InCharge (whether arising out of or relating to past, present or future acts or omissions) (“Claims”) shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court (“Arbitration Agreement”).
Waiver of Class Actions. You and In Charge each agree that each party will assert Claims in arbitration only in our individual capacity, and not as a representative or member of any purported class. We each agree that we will not participate in any class, mass, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or other representative arbitration proceeding. Each party agrees that the arbitrator has no authority to arbitrate Claims on a class-wide basis and shall not consolidate, combine, or jointly arbitrate Claims of more than one person in a single arbitration.
Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party waives its constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, electing instead to resolve by binding arbitration all Claims.
Small Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Either party may bring individual Claims in small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures. Either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding, which will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.
Arbitration Provider. Each party will initiate arbitration before JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) or any successor to JAMS, which is an alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”). In the event JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a “Demand for Arbitration”, then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by another mutually agreeable arbitration administration service who will hear the case.
Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (available at www.jamsadr.com) (“Arbitration Rules”). The rules of the ADR Provider will govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Arbitration Agreement.
Arbitration Location. If an in-person hearing is required, then it will take place in Orlando, FL, Minneapolis, MN, Chicago, IL, New York City, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Atlanta, GA or Dallas, TX (whichever is closest to your residence), unless the claimant primarily resides outside the United States (in which case the arbitrator will give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings).
Fees. Payment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Arbitration Rules.
Arbitrator’s Authority and Award. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of the parties, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the ADR Provider’s Rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and reasoned statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. Any award will be subject to judicial confirmation or entry in any court having jurisdiction.
Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.
