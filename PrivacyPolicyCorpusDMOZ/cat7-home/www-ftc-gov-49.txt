Lists of Privacy Act Systems of Records Currently Maintained by the FTCWhat are Privacy Act System of Records Notices? Below is a list of every FTC "system" of electronic and/or paper records that contain personally identifiable information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. Each system of records notice (SORN) below describes what, why, and how we collect, maintain, and use records in that system. We update the SORN if and when we make any system changes. Some of these systems maintain information from or about individuals within the FTC, such as our official personnel system. Other FTC systems maintain information from or about individuals outside the FTC, such as our consumer complaint system. If a system listed below contains your personal information, and you want to request access, please visit our Make a FOIA Request page.Table of Contents - System Number and System Name I.
