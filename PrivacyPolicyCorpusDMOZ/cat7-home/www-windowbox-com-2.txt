For those of us who love hobbies that come with their own sets of toys, there's no better pastime than indoor gardening. With the sheer number of indoor garden supplies, it's possible to add to our private arsenals is impressive; from container garden materials -- like windowboxes, liners and caddies -- to products that simply make indoor gardening easier, like germination trays and gardening pads. When you begin collecting indoor gardening tools, it'll feel as though you never put away your building blocks.
