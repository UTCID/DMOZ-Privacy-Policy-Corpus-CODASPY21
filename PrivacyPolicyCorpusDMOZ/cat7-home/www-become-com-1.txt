Privacy Shield
Connexity (and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Connexity Audience, Inc.) participates in the
EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield framework. Connexity is committed to subjecting all personal data received
from EU
member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to the principles underlying the
Privacy Shield
(the “Principles”). To learn more about the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, and to view
Connexity’s
certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce site at
https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
If we transfer personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy
Shield, to
a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to
data
subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us
contractual
assurances that it will (i) process the personal data for limited and specific purposes
consistent
with any consent provided by the data subjects; (ii) provide at least the same level of
privacy
protection as is required by the Principles and notify us if it makes a determination it
cannot do
so; and (iii) cease processing of the personal data or take other reasonable and appropriate
steps
to remediate if it makes such a determination. If Connexity has knowledge that a third party
acting
as a controller is processing such personal data in a way that is contrary to the
Principles,
Connexity will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.
With respect to our third-party agents, we will transfer only the personal data needed for
an agent
to deliver to Connexity the requested product or service. Furthermore, we will (i) permit
the agent
to process such personal data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) require the
agent to
provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles;
(iii) take
reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal
data
transferred in a manner consistent with Connexity’s obligations under the Principles; and
(iv)
require the agent to notify Connexity if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet
its
obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles. Upon
receiving
notice from an agent that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of
protection as is required by the Principles, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps
to stop
and remediate unauthorized processing.
Connexity remains liable under the Principles if an agent processes personal data received
from EU
member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, in a manner inconsistent with the
Principles,
except where Connexity is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
