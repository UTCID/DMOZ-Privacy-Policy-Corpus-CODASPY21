Privacy Policy:
We are committed to maintaining your privacy. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes no information regarding the domain or e-mail address. The information we collect is gathered during the ordering process. This includes name, address, telephone number and email address. We do not share your personal information with other companies. We use your information to process your order, send newsletters and receive your valuable feedback. Visitors who choose to browse our site remain completely anonymous.
Security Policy:
Your privacy is very important to us. Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged on our site. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, prior to sending the information so it cannot be read over the internet.
Refund Policy:
Our products are of the highest quality. Your product will arrive either frozen or chilled. We work hard to ensure your order is selected and shipped correctly. If an item is out of stock, we will notify you and give you an opportunity to substitute.
Product loss due to an incorrect or incomplete address voids our guarantee. We encourage perishable orders to be delivered to a business or commercial address. We are not responsible or liable for the condition of orders that are left outside when the customer is not available to receive the order. The billing customer is responsible to make sure the recipient will be available for delivery.
If recipients have any questions, problems or concerns regarding an order, we ask that you notify us immediately for assistance, or by the next day after receiving your order by calling us at 1-800-55GUMBO or emailing us at robyn@pigeoncaterers.com. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday – 9:00a.m. to 4:00 p.m. central time. We reserve the right to conduct an investigation into claims that are potentially fraudulent. Please do not discard any packaging until you are completely satisfied with the product. All perishable sales are final.
Shipping Policy/Delivery Policy:
We only ship to the Continental United States.
Delivery service is 2 Day delivery to most residential and business addresses. We only ship Monday through Wednesday. We do not ship on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
Orders placed on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be shipped on Monday or date specified. We do not ship the day before any holiday. Please email for holiday ordering deadlines and holiday delivery. All shipments require a street address.
