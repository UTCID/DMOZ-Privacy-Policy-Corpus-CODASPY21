bcarboretum.org Data Privacy Policy
Boone County Arboretum (the "Arboretum") and the supporting 501(c)(3) Friends of Boone County Arboretum (the "Friends"), either together and/or individually, may acquire and/or store certain information from visitors to this website, for the purpose of direct communications, analysis and improvement of the website user experience, analysis of regional interaction and impact, and marketing.
Through various direct-entry forms on this website, including those for making donations, purchasing memberships or event registrations, and other such interactions, site visitors may choose to share with us individually identifiable information about themselves including but not limited to contact methods, demographic stats, and/or interest/purchase history. Additionally, our website interfaces with our hosting provider's site visitation analysis platform, and with the Google Analytics platform, and the Facebook For Developers platform. By viewing a page, clicking links, or any other interaction on our website, site visitors could be sharing additional information and contributing to metadata statistics through these analysis platforms. The information collected this way may be somewhat individually identifiable, such as their device's current IP address. Or it may be anonymized-and-aggregated (according to the policies of those individual platforms), including but not limited to: the city/metro and Internet provider to which their IP address is registered, the website that referred them to this site, or viewing patterns for pages on this site. Data may be collected and/or stored, in whole or in part, at various times, on our website server, on our site visitation analysis platform servers, on our payment processing gateway server, on our staff computers, or on the devices of site visitors (Internet cookies).
The protection of this data and the privacy of our supporters are important to us. Any credit card information typed into a purchase form on our site is sent securely to our payment gateway at the moment of the transaction, and is not stored by the site or staff. Regarding other collected information, we do not and will not sell to mailing list wholesalers or other questionable marketing outlets. However, it may be shared internally, on a limited and as-needed basis, among staff, board members, officers, and certain volunteers for purposes such as: analyzing and interpreting regional and demographic reach, site visitation patterns, improving the site user experience, and for the completion of various Arboretum and/or Friends initiatives. Some data may occasionally be sent to external third-party contractors or affiliated agencies, but only as necessary for the completion of our own initiatives – for example, if we outsource postal mailing of event announcements, the contractor will obviously need a list of addresses in order to do the job.
Questions and concerns about this data privacy policy may be directed to the Arboretum office.
By continuing to use the bcarboretum.org website, you acknowledge and agree to this policy, and consent to the use of Internet cookies.
