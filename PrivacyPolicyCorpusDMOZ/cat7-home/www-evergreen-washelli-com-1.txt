About
Families have trusted Evergreen Washelli Cemetery for generations--we have served the Seattle community for over 135 years, and the 144-acre memorial park provides a wide range of burial services and is renowned for being the largest, most scenic and historic cemetery in Seattle.
The professional staff at Evergreen Washelli Funeral Home are experts at creating unique, one-of-a-kind services for your loved ones. Whether you are planning a traditional funeral service or a more personalized celebration of life, we are honored to assist in creating a memorial service that uniquely celebrates your loved one. Our spacious facility has multiple venues that can handle both large events and intimate affairs.
An inclusive funeral home
Seattle is diverse and our neighbors come from all walks of life. At Evergreen Washelli Funeral Home, we are happy to conduct your funeral or memorial service according to you and your loved one’s customs and traditions, no matter your religion, background or culture. As a non-denominational facility, we have proudly served families of all faiths for generations.
Facilities to meet your every need
Whether you are planning a viewing for close family and friends, or need a large gathering space, our funeral home has facilities to meet your needs. We offer several visitation areas to choose from for more intimate services. Our Celebration Hall is a large multi-purpose space for celebration of life and memorial events, seating about 100 and is commonly used for catered meals. And the Tribute Center, seating 150, offers state of the art technology, video screens, music and computer capabilities.
Celebrations of Life
We believe in honoring your loved one through a celebration that is personal and provides a healing experience to family and friends. Celebrations of life, led by our certified celebrants, can be held with burial or cremation and celebrate a life well lived. From traditional ceremonies to unique celebrations, we pride ourselves on helping you plan the perfect event.
Evergreen Washelli has been known for our customization and unique event options that most locations just don’t offer.

Cremation Services
Cremation can and should be, just as personal as a burial and funeral service. A service before or after the cremation offers families and friends the opportunity to express their farewell.

Let us guide you through our trusted and dignified cremation options that can be personalized to truly celebrate a life lived.

Proudly Serving those who have served
People who have served in the armed forces deserve special consideration. To pay tribute to our fallen heroes, Evergreen Washelli assists in coordinating veterans burial benefits to those eligible. At Evergreen Washelli Cemetery, we can handle the details for you and provide all options so you can make an informed decision.
Available veteran benefits include: inscribed cemetery marker, U.S. flag, gun salute, payment, transportation costs.

A place for healing and reflection allows family and friends to find comfort long after services are over, and establishes your family legacy. There are a wide variety of options for burial and cremation memorialization, and we honor your burial traditions, no matter your religion, background or culture.
To further personalize a place of reflection, Evergreen Washelli Cemetery offers a variety of burial, entombment and cremation memorialization options which include:
Family Estates - Design the perfect private garden estate to accommodate as many people as desired. This can be burial space, cremation space, a private mausoleum, or a combination of any of these forms of memorialization.
Snoqualmie Estates - With its running creek and bubbling fountain, these estates provide beautifully secluded and peaceful resting places that harbor quiet reflection and remembrance for generations to come.
San Juan Mausoleum - Provides a beautiful and affordable option for above-ground placement.
San Juan Mausoleum Niches - A peaceful location surrounded by nature, this option is available for those preferring outdoor, above-ground placement of cremated remains. This granite columbarium contains niches that can hold either single or companion placements.
Washelli Columbarium - A beautiful and serene setting with its many water features, this option offers bronze or glass-front niches. The glass front niches allow for personalized memorialization for individuals or multiple family members. Sheltered and handicap-accessible, the Washelli Columbarium provides comfort and convenience.
Tree-Ring Cremation Gardens - A contemporary concept in cremation memorialization, Tree-Ring Gardens is a small, elegantly landscaped garden providing for economical individual placement of cremated remains.
Cremation Gardens - We offer several traditional cremation ground-burial options including Memory Glen. Our Memory Glen Wall allows for above-ground placement. Both are located in a garden surrounded in the beauty of nature.
Lawn Crypts - The Evergreen Lawn Crypt section provides a modern and affordable burial option. Modern engineering is used to create a well-drained section of pre-placed concrete burial liners, both single and double-depth. This is a beautiful yet economical burial option for individuals and couples.
Ground Burial—Evergreen Washelli has a wide variety of ground-burial areas throughout the cemetery.
Veteran’s Cemetery
The first Memorial Day Service at the Evergreen Washelli Veterans’ Memorial Cemetery was held on May 30, 1927. At noon, a moment of silence was followed by a twenty-one-gun salute by the Battery I, 146th Field Artillery. The first headstone was placed during this service. Marine Private Thomas McElderry died on October 13, 1926. His mother, upon learning of the new cemetery for veterans, requested that he be placed where he would be honored for his military service. His body was moved to the new Veterans’ Memorial Cemetery.
Shortly after the cemetery was established, the American Legion donated a flagpole which has proudly flown our nation’s colors since. Chimes Tower, donated in the 1950s, rings the hours with its carillon. It stands as a memorial to veterans buried elsewhere, but remembered by friends and relatives.
Guarding the walkway to the Chimes Tower are two carronades from the U.S.S. Constitution which became famous after an 1812 battle against the Guerriere, a fast British frigate. The British ship fired furiously, but her shots glanced from the hull of the Constitution, whose cheering crew bestowed their sturdy frigate with the nickname “Old Ironsides.” The Constitution became a symbol of the United States’ rise to power. The presence of these guns and other symbols of military honor within the Veterans’ Memorial Cemetery serve to remind us that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.
History
Evergreen Washelli Cemetery was started in 1884 in an area known as Oak Lake by David Denny, one of the founders of Seattle. In 1887, his cousin moved his family’s plot to the new burial ground, and family and friends also began to bury their loved ones there. In 1903, Oaklake Cemetery, was inherited by David’s son, Victor who sold the property in 1914 to the American Necropolis Association, a St. Louis-based company that owned cemetery properties in several states. ANA named the cemetery “Washelli” (a Makah word meaning “west wind”).
In 1919, the Evergreen Cemetery Company started a competing cemetery on the western side of Aurora Avenue, directly opposite Washelli Cemetery. In 1922, Evergreen Cemetery purchased Washelli from ANA. The cemetery changed its name to Evergreen Washelli in 1962.
The Evergreen Washelli funeral home was started in 1972. It quickly outgrew its offices on the eastern side of Washelli and in 1994, moved into larger facilities on the Evergreen side of the property. To meet the need for a gathering and reception space, Evergreen Washelli expanded the funeral home facility in 2008 to include modern and inviting reception rooms.

April 2020
"We experienced the unexpected loss of our son during the COVID 19 tight restrictions on funerals. We were devastated at our loss and frantic that funeral homes were telling us we could not even view our son and say goodbye. Evergreen Washelli, and particularly Danielle and Stacy, somehow managed to facilitate the rituals that were so important to us. They were calm, quietly compassionate, problem solvers and let us know what to expect at every step of the way. We will never forget their kindness."
Verified Burial & Memorial Service Customer
April 2020
"Evergreen-Washelli was the most beautiful cemetery we looked at, and the care and dignity that our beloved mother received was truly top-notch.
We knew we could trust that she was in respectful hands for preparations, and Keith and Phil were very kind and professional to work with. The service accommodations were just right. We also take comfort in knowing that those cemetery grounds are going to be meticulously maintained and operated for generations to come. We are so glad we found Evergreen-Washelli!
It is a beautiful park where individuals jog and walk their doggies, and where squirrels and birds roam about. It is a place of life, as well as of our dearly departed."

"I was able to pre-arrange the services for my mother a few years ago.
Having done this in advance made things so much less stressful when the time came.
I had heard of The Neptune Society, but Evergreen Washelli had handled my fathers passing 8 years before, so I contacted them instead.
Being able to arrange everything I needed via email was exceptional.
Thank you for being forward thinkers in your industry."
Verified Burial & Memorial Service Customer
February 2020
"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.
My mother moved to Seattle in 2018 and had a pre-paid plan that needed to be transferred from another funeral home, which the staff here accomplished almost seamlessly.
They explained in detail what I could expect at the time of her death, gave me price lists for their services, and did not try to upsell me on additional products.
Although I understand that Evergreen-Washelli might be a little more expensive than other local funeral homes, I am happy that I chose them."

"Do yourself and your family a huge favor and ask for Phil.
He is not pushy with anything.
Phil is upfront and honest with you and will tell you what is needed and isn't needed.
When there is a way to cut cost if you are on a tight budget, he will let you know.
There are also time that there is no way to cut costs and he will let you know that too.
There were no hidden fees, or surprises and for the whole team at Evergreen Washelli, I thank them for that.
You hear of horror stories about crooked funeral directors on the web but that is not what you will get here."

"I felt like Danielle genuinely cared about what our family was going through and did all she could to help us make sense of it all. I appreciated that she always followed up on any concerns or issues we had and to make sure our needs were met. Thanks Danielle!"

"Having a Pre burial arrangement is one of the greatest ways to let your loved ones know that just because you are no longer physically there you are still looking out for them and their well-being. It's the greatest gift you can ever give."

"When picking up my husband's ashes from the Columbarium, I found it to be a very comforting experience and the staff person that assisted me was so friendly, caring, thoughtful, I am sorry I didn't get her name.
We talked for almost 45 minutes.
She showed me around the columbarium as well.
Very peaceful setting."

We celebrate, honor, and love life. I have come to know how short life truly is, and am honored to help families/people at the time of great loss. It is important to me we do all we can to exceed the expectations of the family… they deserve nothing less. We do this by supporting our employees and helping provide the resources needed to deliver an outstanding event for all those in attendance.
I am grateful for the trust families place in us and for the opportunity to help people and their family members, at one of their most difficult and trying times in this life.
I am a lifelong resident of this area, growing up in Mukilteo. I have been married for 22 years and alongside my beautiful wife have been able to raise an awesome family… two boys and a girl. Some say they’ve given me my grey hair… others say it’s work…likely it’s the work as my kids can do no wrong.
