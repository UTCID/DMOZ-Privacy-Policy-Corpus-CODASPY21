I. Introduction
The National Education Association ("NEA") values the trust and privacy of its members and other supporters.

III. Personal Information Collected
We may collect personal information about you from the following sources:
Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us on your membership application and other NEA forms — whether online via the NEA website or NEA Intranet or offline via traditional, hard copy forms (such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, social security number, etc.).
Other Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us via the NEA website or NEA Intranet (such as an e-mail address if you subscribe to an NEA-produced electronic newsletter or other personal information contained in an e-mail that you send to us via the feedback feature of the NEA website).

Personal Information that we receive from third parties (such as insurance claim information in connection with the NEA Educators Employment Liability Program and publicly available voter registration information).
IV. How We Use That Information
The personal information that NEA collects about you helps us and our state and local affiliates and NEA-related organizations to efficiently and effectively represent you and provide you with valuable member benefits.
V. Information Sharing
In order to provide you with efficient and effective representation and member benefits, we routinely share all of the personal information that we collect about you, as described in Section III above, with our state and local affiliates and NEA-related organizations, as well as third parties that perform services on our behalf.
Additionally, we may share any of the personal information that we collect about you, as described in Section III above, with certain third parties that share our interests or as otherwise permitted by law.
All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent, which information will not be shared with any third parties, provided that the foregoing does not apply to sharing (1) with vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf (and who will not use such information for their own purposes); (2) if we believe disclosure is required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation or to comply with law enforcement or legal process; and (3) if the user consents to our sharing of such information.
VI. Available Choices
Any personal information that you provide to us is voluntary. NEA members may update their personal information at any time. For information on how to contact us, please visit the NEA website at: https://www.nea.org/about-nea/contact-us.

VII. Your California Privacy Rights
California residents have a right under state law to ask entities with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information regarding the sharing of personal information for direct marketing purposes during the past year.

IX. Additional Information for Users of the NEA Web Site or NEA Intranet
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
If you use the NEA website or the NEA Intranet, you provide us with certain non-personal information in addition to any personal information that you may voluntarily provide. For example, if you browse the NEA website or NEA Intranet or download information, our operating system automatically records the following non-personal information:
The Internet domain for your Internet service (such as "xcompany.com" or "xcompany.net" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourcollege.edu" if you connect from a college or university domain);
The type of browser that you use (such as "America Online version 7" or "Microsoft Internet Explorer 5");
The type of operating system that you use (such as Windows or Macintosh);
The date and time that you visit the NEA website or NEA Intranet and the webpages that you view;
The address of the previous website that you visited if you linked to us from another website; and
The address of the next website that you visit if you link to it from the NEA website or NEA Intranet.
We use the above non-personal information to diagnose technical problems and track user interests so that we can provide content that interests you.
We gather this non-personal information in the aggregate and we share it in the same manner that we share personal information, as described in Section V above.
Cookies
We use cookies to track what you are viewing when you visit the NEA website and NEA Intranet, and to enhance your user experience. In order to provide you with customized content and an enhanced user experience, certain cookies used by NEA identify you as an individual.

However, some NEA features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
Additionally, NEA allows third parties who advertise or provide content on the NEA website or NEA Intranet to use cookies. Third parties' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
Discussion Forums
If you participate in a discussion forum on the NEA website or NEA Intranet, your comments, along with any personal information that you voluntarily disclose, may be collected, used, and shared by anyone with access to that forum. We are not responsible for the personal information that you choose to submit in a discussion forum.

It does not cover any websites that are linked to or from the NEA website or NEA Intranet for which we are not responsible ("linked-sites"). These linked-sites will have their own policies and practices which may be different from ours. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the policies and practices of the linked-sites especially if you provide personal information to them.
X. Effective Date, Amendments, and Consent to This Privacy Policy
