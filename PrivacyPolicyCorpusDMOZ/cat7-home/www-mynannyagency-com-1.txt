By using the Site or Services, you hereby represent, warrant, understand, agree to and accept these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms in their entirety whether or not you submit an application to be a Nanny (as defined below), become a Customer (as defined below) or are otherwise a user of the Site and/or Services ("Users").These Terms include the MyNanny Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. If you object to anything in these Terms or the Privacy Policy, do not use the Site or the Services.These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, are subject to change at any time. MyNanny will notify you about significant changes in these Terms by sending a notice to the email address you provided in your application, or by placing a prominent notice on the Site, so that you can choose whether to continue using the Site and/or Services. Significant changes will go into effect no less than 30 days after MyNanny notifies you. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately upon posting of the updated Terms on the Site. It is solely your responsibility to periodically check the “Terms and Use” tab at www.MyNanny.com for updates. Any use of the Site or the Services by you after the effective date of any changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes.The "Services" shall mean any of the various services that MyNanny provides through the Site or any other channels, including over the telephone, and including providing information to and about qualified men who provide care services (individually a “Nanny” or collectively, "Nannies"), and to and about individuals seeking child care from MyNanny (each a "Customer"), ordering and providing results for background checks on Nannies, and all other actions taken by MyNanny to connect Nannies and Customers.1. Description of Services; Limitations; User Responsibilities1.1 About the ServicesMyNanny offers various Services to help place Nannies with interested Customers. The Services include, among others:·  Vetting Nannies by obtaining background checks and requiring and reviewing additional personal information about Nannies before allowing them to apply for jobs with Customers and before creating profiles for Nannies and sending any Nanny profiles to Customers.·  Collecting information from Customers to generate a job description for that Customer's needs.·  Sending relevant job descriptions to Nannies; and sending relevant Nanny profiles to Customers to allow Customers and Nannies to narrow the pool of Customers or Nannies they are interested in meeting based on their needs and preferences, while maintaining the confidentiality of the Customers' and Nannies' contact information until the Customer and Nanny consent to an in-person interview.1.2 Limitations of the ServicesMyNanny offers a variety of Services to help Users find, coordinate, and maintain quality care from Nannies. However, MyNanny does not employ any Nannies. Customers are the potential employers of Nannies and are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable payroll, tax and minimum wage laws).Further, MyNanny does not have control over the quality, timing, or legality of the services actually delivered by Nannies, nor of the integrity, responsibility or actions of Customers or Nannies. MyNanny recommends Customers and Nannies to one another based strictly on geographic location and the information available to us from Customer and Nanny applications and background checks. MyNanny does not guarantee or make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, and accuracy of the services provided by Nannies or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Customers or Nannies whether in public, private or offline interactions.Customer and Nanny content is primarily user generated, and MyNanny does not control or vet user generated content for accuracy as a general matter. MyNanny does not assume any responsibility for, nor does MyNanny guarantee or warrant as to, the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Nannies or Customers on or off this Site.MyNanny is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Customer, Nanny or other user of the Site or Services. Moreover, MyNanny does not assume and expressly disclaims any liability that may result from the use of information provided on the Site. All users, including Customers and Nannies, hereby expressly agree not to hold MyNanny (or MyNanny's officers, members, employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, other affiliates, successors, assignees, or agents, hereinafter "Affiliates") liable for the action or inaction of any Customer, Nanny or other third party or for any information, instruction, advice or services which originated through the Site, and, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, MyNanny and its Affiliates expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any damage, suits, claims, and/or controversies that have arisen or may arise, whether known or unknown from any Customer, MyNanny or other third party.1.3 User ResponsibilitiesMyNanny conducts background checks and other basic vetting of Nannies. However, information obtained by MyNanny about Nannies should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the Nanny's suitability as an employee or care provider. Customers are responsible for interviewing, performing any additional background and reference checks on, and verifying information provided by Nannies, and ultimately selecting an appropriate Nanny for themselves and their family. Similarly, the information obtained by Nanny about Customers is extremely limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive; and it is the sole responsibility of each Nanny to determine and verify additional information and make an informed decision about Customers for which it will provide service.Each Customer is also responsible for complying with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish, including verifying the age of the Nanny they select as well as that Nanny's eligibility to work in the United States.2.

Should MyNanny find that you violated the Terms, MyNanny reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your use of the Site and Services. Further, in order to protect the integrity of the Site and the Services, MyNanny reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to block Users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Site.The Site and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by MyNanny, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.You are permitted to use the Site for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Payment And Refund PolicyIn order to utilize the MyNanny Services, the user of such Services or product offerings must pay MyNanny a fee in the amount set forth on the page which describes the service and in accordance with the provisions below. In addition, the Customer is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services purchased.4.1 Billing and PaymentCertain aspects of the Services may be subject to payments ("Fees") now or in the future (the "paid services"). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a paid service are deemed part of these Terms of Use. In addition, you are responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services purchased.MyNanny uses a third-party payment processor to bill you for paid services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the payment processor in addition to these Terms of Use. MyNanny shall not in any event be responsible for error by the payment processor. By choosing to use paid services, you agree to pay Nanny, through the payment processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for the applicable Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize MyNanny, through the payment processor, to charge your credit card or other payment provider (your “payment method”).You agree to make payment using that selected payment method. MyNanny reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. The terms of your payment will be based on your payment method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your payment method.If Nanny, through the payment processor, does not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due to MyNanny on demand. MyNanny's third party payment service provider may receive updated credit card information from your credit card issuer. The disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to MyNanny's third party payment service provider at the election of your credit card issuer. MyNanny is not responsible for the distribution of your credit card information. It is at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt out of the update service. It is your responsibility to contact your credit card issuer with regards to your right to opt out of the update service.If the amount to be charged to your payment method varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and MyNanny shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your payment method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges.4.2 Billing and PaymentYour non-termination or continued use of a paid service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your payment method for that paid service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the paid service.Refund PolicyExcept as set forth below, all Fees and payments for services/products are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for unused or partially used services/products or service/product cancellations. MyNanny does not provide refunds or credits under any other circumstances, unless it determines in its sole discretion that a refund or credit is warranted due to extenuating circumstances, such as a duplicate account. The applicable Fee is payable to MyNanny regardless of any issues that may arise between an individual Nanny and Customer.However, if the EMPLOYEE should leave the service of the FAMILY or be terminated within six months of the first day of employment, the AGENCY agrees to provide its services again free of charge until a suitable replacement can be found. If the FAMILY should need to use our services again in the future after the initial 6-month period, the FAMILY will be expected to pay the full placement fee again. The 6-month replacement guarantee cannot be transferred to another city or be used for another household placement other than a nanny.5. Background and Verification Checks5.1 Background Checks For NanniesMyNanny procures certain background check services for Nannies from consumer reporting agencies in MyNanny's discretion (collectively "Background Checks"). Customers and Nannies may always obtain additional background checks on Nannies or on themselves (with consent and in accordance with applicable law) in Customers sole discretion. MyNanny is not responsible for and shall not maintain records of any background checks obtained by a Nanny or Customer.Background Checks are regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from the Background Checks are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on a person's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.MyNanny will receive a copy of each Background Check ordered or authorized through MyNanny. See Section 4.3 below for information regarding MyNanny's use of these Background Checks. If a Background Check does not come back clean, you will be emailed a copy of the results. You are responsible for making sure that the email addresses you provide to MyNanny is correct, knowing that sensitive information will be sent to it.If a Background Check comes back clean or with information that does not result in MyNanny suspending or terminating a Nanny from using the Site and Services, the Background Check report will be forwarded to any Customer who requests it in accordance with your authorization at the time you applied to MyNanny. The results of any Background Check that results in MyNanny suspending or terminating you from use of the Site or Services will not be shared with other Users.If a Customer orders background check pursuant to a Nanny's written authorization, the consumer reporting agency that performed the check will provide the results directly to the Customer who ordered it, regardless of its contents, based on the Nanny's authorization that the Customer obtains the check.5.2 Special Responsibilities of Customers under FCRACustomers may request and receive a copy of a Background Check on a Nanny via written authorization and agreement outside of these Terms, subject to the MyNanny's explicit instructions about who may have access to such a report.If you receive a copy of a background report, you warrant that you will use such information only for a purpose permitted by FCRA, such as an employment purpose, and that you will comply with any and all applicable obligations of the FCRA as well as all other applicable consumer reporting laws.Your responsibilities in using the information contained in the background check can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm. FCRA governs the use of reports obtained from a consumer reporting agency, such as the third party consumer reporting agencies MyNanny uses.If there is negative data in a background check you receive, and you choose to take "adverse action" (i.e. choose to pass on that individual's candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm.These include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject's right to contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Moreover, if the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.5.3 MyNanny May Order and Use Background Checks About YouBy using the Site or Services as a Customer or Nanny, you hereby acknowledge and agree that MyNanny has the right, but not the obligation, to use a third party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background checks on you for the legitimate business purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of the Site and its Users ("Additional Background Checks"). MyNanny may order these checks when you apply to Nanny and thereafter in connection with your continued use of the Services and/or interaction with the Site (such as by contacting or communicating with other members, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).These Additional Background Checks are also regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.You understand and agree that MyNanny may review the information provided by the third party consumer reporting agency and that MyNanny retains the right to terminate your Nanny application and use of the Site and Services based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently dismissed. If MyNanny terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, it will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. MyNanny will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that MyNanny does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it (and not MyNanny) within the time period specified in your notice.BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW MYNANNY TO PERFORM THESE ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE MYNANNY SITE OR SERVICES. NO FURTHER CONSENT FROM YOU IS REQUIRED FOR THESE CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED.5.4 MyNanny May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and WarrantiesBy applying as a Customer or Nanny, you authorize MyNanny, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Services, MyNanny reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your application data is accurate and that the representations and warranties in Section 2.2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also true ("Verification Checks"). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data.You agree that MyNanny may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation suspending and/or terminating your use of the Site and Services.You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that MyNanny does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in a Verification Check. MyNanny does not typically communicate the results of a Verification Check to any third party, though MyNanny reserves the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes in its sole discretion.BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW MYNANNY TO PERFORM THE VERIFICATION CHECKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE MYNANNY. NO FURTHER CONSENT FROM YOU IS REQUIRED FOR THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED.5.5 Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification ChecksIf you decide to use or access information included in a Background Check, you hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that those checks are not always accurate or complete (or based on information that is accurate or complete) and that the specific records searched, and the comprehensiveness of the search, varies by the type of Background Check ordered as well as the state and county where the check is performed. For example, many jurisdictions only include felony conviction records (and not, for example, misdemeanor or arrest records) in the national criminal data base, which is the only data source utilized for preliminary background checks other than the sexual offender registry. Moreover, some states include only registered sex offenders in that database.If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to indemnify and hold harmless MyNanny from any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from such access, use, or sharing of this information regardless of the cause. MyNanny does not assume and expressly disclaims, and you hereby agree to release MyNanny from, any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from the use of information provided in a background report including, without limitation, the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.You expressly acknowledge that MyNanny has no obligation to perform Additional Background Checks or Verification Checks on any Users. To the extent MyNanny performs such checks on certain Users, the checks are limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those Users have provided or of their eligibility to use the Services.6. TerminationShould MyNanny determine that you are not eligible to use the Services, have violated any terms stated herein or are not suitable for participation as a User, or have mis-used or mis-appropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a "mirrored", competitive, or third party site, MyNanny reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to all or part of the MyNanny Site, to remove your profile from the Site, and/or to terminate your application to MyNanny, and your use of the Site and Services, with or without notice.In any event, MyNanny also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the MyNanny Site, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your application to MyNanny, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. If MyNanny terminates your use of the Site and Services, MyNanny will have no obligation to notify you of the reason, if any, for your termination.Following any termination of any individual's use of the Site or the Services, MyNanny reserves the right to send a notice thereof to other Users with whom the individual may have corresponded.MyNanny's decision to terminate an individual's application and/or to notify other Users with whom it believes the individual has corresponded does not constitute, and should not be interpreted or used as information bearing on, the individual's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.7.
