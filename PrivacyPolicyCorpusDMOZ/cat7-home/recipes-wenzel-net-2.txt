RecipeLand, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the
privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for
the responsible management of consumer information.
Consumer Information
During the process of delivering an ad to you, RecipeLand does not collect any
personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone
number, or e-mail address. However, RecipeLand does obtain some types of
non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you
use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer
operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information
collected by RecipeLand.com is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad
effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a
specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If
this does occur, RecipeLand.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser.
This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition,
RecipeLand.com combine this information with other users' information and review it in
an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of
ad or visit a particular kind of website.
Data Collection
RecipeLand, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" or any unique id provided by your device to enhance your
experience on the web. RecipeLand.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you
in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique
number that is provided to you the first time RecipeLand.com serves you an ad. This unique
number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps RecipeLand.com target ads
to you. This cookie can help RecipeLand.com ensure that we don't serve you the same ad
multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like
about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you
are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance
your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and
delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for RecipeLand.com to deliver
you an ad.
If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually
delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for
more information.
