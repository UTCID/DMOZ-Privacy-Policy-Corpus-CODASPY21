I am Angie Cox and I started YLF after 15 years in the fashion industry as a designer, retail buyer and consultant. These days I'm a fashion stylist to individual clients and I write daily about personal style. You can become a YLF member to join us in the forum or to collect finds, but you're equally welcome as an anonymous reader.

YLF’s failure to act or your failure to act with respect to a breach does not waive YLF’s rights or your right to act subsequently. You may not assign or transfer your rights under this Agreement, or delegate any duties. YLF retains the right to assign its rights under this Agreement or delegate its duties in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of substantially all of its assets.
