AutoWeb is NOT a Vehicle Seller, a broker or agent for Vehicle Sellers or a provider of or broker or agent for automotive financing, insurance or other automotive-related products or services offered by third parties ("Third Party Product and Service Providers"). Content and information displayed on the AutoWeb Websites is being provided for educational and research purposes only. The AutoWeb Websites are designed to enable users to obtain online and offline price, payment and financing quotes from participating Vehicle Sellers and Third Party Product and Service. AutoWeb does not provide these price or payment quotes and is not responsible for any such quotes or other information provided by Vehicle Sellers or third Party Product and Service Providers All quotes are estimates only and exclude state and local taxes, as well as any state and local governmental charges, including without limitation, registration, license and title fees, documentary fees, emissions certification fees and added accessories you may choose to place on a vehicle. On occasion, errors by the Vehicle Sellers or Third Party Product and Service Providers may occur in the entry of condition, warranty, pricing and/or payment data that forms the basis of such quotes furnished through AutoWeb Websites. AutoWeb is not responsible for these errors, but works with Vehicle Sellers and Third Party Product and Service Providers to correct these errors when they come to AutoWeb’s attention. AutoWeb plays no part in actual sales or lease transaction or in brokering sales or lease transactions and has no control over the quality or safety of the vehicles advertised, nor the truth or accuracy of vehicle descriptions (including condition or installed options or equipment), the actual availability of any specific vehicle listed or the truth or accuracy of descriptions of other products or services. In addition, AutoWeb does not own or operate any services used for facilitating the actual sale or transfer of vehicles between buyers and sellers, including escrow services or title transfer services. Avoid any such service that claims to be operated by AutoWeb. You are encouraged to thoroughly review any documents you are asked to sign at the time of purchase or lease of a vehicle or the purchase of other products or services, as neither a Vehicle Seller nor a Third Party Product and Service Provider is prohibited from independently negotiating all of the terms and conditions of the final sale or lease. Any terms, conditions, warranties or representations in a written contract with the Vehicle Seller or Third Party Product and Service Provider are legally binding upon you. AutoWeb is not a party to any transaction between you and a Vehicle Seller or a Third Party Product and Servicer Provider and makes no representations or warranties, implied or otherwise, with respect to any vehicles (including, without limitation, the condition of vehicles listed on an AutoWeb Website) or any other products or services.

AutoWeb does not guarantee either expressly or by implication that AutoWeb will find a vehicle that meets your specifications.

ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.

Agreement to Arbitrate
(a)  AutoWeb and you agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between us arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy or use of the sites, via the sites or through mobile application, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  These terms to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law.  However, any dispute you or we may have relating to copyrights or other intellectual property shall not be governed by this agreement to arbitrate.  For the avoidance of doubt, this means that any claims you or we may have relating to intellectual property rights against the other, including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
This agreement to arbitrate otherwise includes, but is not limited to claims based in contract, tort, warranty, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Terms of Use (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; claims relating to our websites; claims arising out of or relating to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; claims relating to your data privacy or information security; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to "AutoWeb," "you," and "us" shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information provided or made available under this or prior agreements between us relating to or arising from any aspect of your use or access of the sites.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.  You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, including this agreement to arbitrate, you and AutoWeb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law.  These Terms evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use or your relationship with AutoWeb for any reason.
(b)  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Dispute Notice'').  The Notice to AutoWeb should be addressed to the following address ("Dispute Notice Address''):
AutoWeb, Inc.
400 North Ashley Drive, Suite 300
Tampa, Florida 33602-4314
Attention: Legal Department
The Dispute Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from AutoWeb ("Demand'').  If AutoWeb and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or AutoWeb may commence an arbitration proceeding.
(c)  After AutoWeb receives a notice at the Dispute Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee.  The filing fee currently is $200, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.  The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms Of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.  The AAA Rules may change from time to time, and you should review them periodically.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or these Terms of Use are void or voidable.  However if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall decide whether these Terms of Use permit class or representative proceedings.  For the avoidance of doubt, the court and arbitrator shall be bound by these Terms of Use, including with regard to the class and representative waiver provision. In any arbitration, the arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.  The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit manifest errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs a manifest error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
Unless AutoWeb and you agree otherwise, any arbitration will be governed by the substantive laws of your state, and hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your permanent residence. Case management and other hearings shall be heard via telephone unless agreed to otherwise. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AutoWeb will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.  If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AutoWeb for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AutoWeb or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AutoWeb is entitled.  In arbitration, and to the extent otherwise permitted by law, the parties may exchange “offers of compromise” or stipulate to judgments or awards in the same way the parties could in court, including for example, under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 for arbitrations taking place in the State of California.  Such offers of compromise shall have the same force and effect as they would in a court proceeding.  The arbitration proceedings shall otherwise remain confidential, except for purposes of seeking court intervention (if necessary).
(d)  Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.
(e)  YOU AND AUTOWEB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  If this specific subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.  However, if only a portion of this subparagraph (e) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (e) enforced. Any claims or causes of action seeking relief not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of individual arbitration to the maximum extent permitted by law.
(f)  Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if AutoWeb makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Dispute Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the AutoWeb Sites, you may reject any such change and require AutoWeb to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time at the time you initially requested or received any services from us if a dispute between us arises, by providing Notice to AutoWeb at the Dispute Notice Address in subsection (b) above.
