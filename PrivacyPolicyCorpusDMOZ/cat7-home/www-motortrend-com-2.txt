MOTOR TREND GROUP
COOKIES & TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES POLICY
WHO WE ARE
We are Motor Trend Group, LLC (“MTG“), registered in the United States with company number 6453648 whose registered office is at 8403 Colesville Rd, Silver Spring, MD 20910, United States of America. MTG is a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. Our representative in the European Union (“EU”) is Dplay Entertainment Limited, registered in England with company number 09615785 whose registered office is at Chiswick Park Building 2, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5YB, United Kingdom.
We provide a range of free and paid-for content services, which are available through our websites or our mobile and television applications worldwide (with content availability subject to geographic territories) (the “Services“).
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information from and about you when you visit our website or app, create an account with us, or otherwise interact with us. This Cookies & Tracking Technologies Policy explains how we and our service providers use cookies or similar technologies and your choices concerning them.
If you have any questions or need any help in relation to this Cookies & Tracking Technologies Policy, please see our contact details at the end of this policy.
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
Below are some examples of the types of tracking technologies that may be used, depending on how you access and interact with the Services.
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites. Like virtual door keys, cookies unlock a computer’s memory and allow a website to recognize users when they return to a site by opening doors to different content or services. Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information, but when it is read by a browser it can help a website improve the service delivered.
Cookie files are automatically lodged into the cookie file – the memory of your browser – and each one typically contains:
the name of the server the cookie was sent from;
the lifetime of the cookie;
a value – usually a randomly generated unique number.
The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognize you when you return to a site or browse from page to page. Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.

Other tracking technologies may include pixel tags, which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs and are embedded invisibly on webpages and measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
Why are cookies AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES used on our Services?
Cookies and other tracking technologies are used to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and to improve our Services. Cookies and other tracking technologies also help you navigate our website efficiently and allow us to perform certain functions, including website traffic analysis. Cookies and other tracking technologies may also recognise you on your next login and offer you content tailored to your preferences and interests.
Some cookies and other tracking technologies can collect personal information, including information you disclose like your username, or track you and build up a profile in order to deliver more relevant advertising content.  For further details on how we use your personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.
Who is likely to place cookies and other tracking technologies on your device, and for what purpose?
a) MTG
MTG may place cookies and other tracking technologies on your device for various purposes: to help you to navigate the Services more easily, to administer and provide the service to you and to deliver better and more personalised content on the Services.
The cookies and other tracking technologies we place enable us for instance:
To adapt the display format of the content and our Services to your device;
To track your navigation in order to identify your preferences in terms of content from the Services;
To offer you customised content on the Services based on your preferences identified via your navigation data;
If applicable, to help carry out any purchases you intend to make on the Services; and
To recognise your device, so that you do not have to re-enter the same information each time you access the Services.
b) Third parties: service providers, partners, advertisers
Third parties may place cookies and other tracking technologies on your device to provide audience-measurement and social-sharing functions and to customise content or advertising.
We do not control the processing of personal information collected through these cookies or other tracking technologies by third party companies and we are not responsible for third parties’ use of personal information collected through the cookies or other tracking technologies. These companies have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please refer to each third-party company’s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you.
You have the right to opt-out of non-essential third-party cookies and other tracking technologies. To learn about his please see section 6 on how to consent to or object to the placement of cookies or other tracking technologies on our Services.
Measurement: Audience, Traffic, Technique
Audience-measurement cookies and tracking technologies are used by third parties to obtain information about your browsing patterns, so as to (among other things):
Understand how you arrive at a website, and reconstruct your path;
Count the number of visitors to the Services, with a view, in particular, to improving the content we offer;
Compile traffic and/or conversion statistics; and
Access your user account.
Social Media Share Buttons
We may offer you the possibility to share the content on the Services with other people or render public your viewing or appreciation of such content by clicking on social media sharing buttons such as Recommend (Facebook, Google+), Tweet (Twitter) or Send by email.
Even if you do not use social media share buttons when visiting the Services, the social networks that provided the buttons can identify you through them. Indeed, the mere fact that your account with a social network is activated on your device (open session) when you browse the Services, can allow that network to monitor your navigation of the Services.
Advertising Spaces
Cookies or other tracking technologies are likely to be placed on your device through advertising spaces on the Services.
These cookies and other tracking technologies may be set at the level of the advertising content displayed in our advertising spaces either by the advertisers themselves, or by their ad serving providers (third party ad servers) such as communications consultancies, audience measuring firms and targeted advertising providers: the cookies and other tracking technologies are associated with the advertising content.
The main purposes for which advertisers and third-party ad servers use cookies or trackers are:
To count the number of displays of advertising content in our advertising spaces, identify the advertisements displayed and calculate the amounts payable to the various advertising stakeholders (communications agency, advertising sales house, publishing medium, etc.);
To compile statistics;
To collect navigation data on devices browsing the Services and, for instance, limit the number of times an advertisement is displayed and/or enable advertisements to appear in a precise order;
To recognise your device if and when you subsequently browse any third-party website or service on which these advertisers or third-party ad servers also issue cookies and other tracking technologies, and if applicable, adapt these third-party websites and services, or the advertisements they show, to any navigation data from your device that may be known to them; and
To determine whether a particular advertising campaign has produced the desired results by keeping track of how many people clicked on the advertising content or visited the advertiser’s website after seeing the advertisement on the Services.

What types of cookies and tracking technologies do we use and how long do we store the collected personal information?
Our Services use several types of cookies and other tracking technologies including:
Session Cookies: Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser’s subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website.
Persistent Cookies: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website, and remain in your browser’s subfolder until they expire (usually after 12 months).
Secure Cookies: Secure cookies are a type of cookie which is transmitted over encrypted HTTP connection. When setting the cookie, the Secure attribute instructs the browser that the cookie should only be returned to the application over encrypted connections.
Third-Party Cookies: A third party cookie is one that is placed on your hard drive by a website from a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g. when the website features content, such as ads, from a third-party domain). Third party cookies are set so that a site can remember something about you at a later time.  These cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.
SameSite Cookies: SameSite cookies allow servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.  SameSite cookies may not be supported by all browsers.
Pixel tags: These technologies consist of small transparent image files or other web programming code that record how you interact with the Services. They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies or other identifiers associated with your device.
The types of cookies that may be used on our Services fall into one of four categories as follows:
Strictly Necessary’ Cookies. These cookies are essential for the operation of our Services and enable you to access certain features. We use these cookies and other tracking technologies for system administration, to monitor traffic and prevent fraudulent activity, to improve the security of the Services and to provide the basic functionality of the Services, such as creating and logging into your account and utilising essential features of the Services. Without these cookies, we would be unable to provide you with the online services you request. These cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.
Functional Cookies. Functional cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our Services. They also remember your preferences (such as your username, language and region) on our Services and enable us to personalise our content for you. The information collected by these cookies is usually anonymised, so we cannot identify you personally. Functional cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which could be used for selling advertising, but they do help with serving advertising.
Analytical Cookies. Analytical cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Services. For example, they allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Services when they are using it. The information provided by these cookies allows us to analyse patterns of user behaviour and we use that information to enhance user experience or identify areas of the Services which may require maintenance. All of the information collected by these cookies is anonymous and is only used for statistical purposes.
Targeting Cookies. These cookies may be placed on your device by us or by trusted third parties. They remember that you have visited our Services and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA) and involves the monitoring of interests based upon web browsing history. Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (for example, your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you. Although behavioural advertising cookies can track your activity around the Internet they cannot identify you personally, even if you are signed in to our Services. Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. If you would like more information about OBA, including how to opt-out of these cookies, please see below or visit www.youronlinechoices.com.
How can you consent or object to cookies or other tracking technologies being placed on your device?
Depending on the local laws that are applicable to you, you have the right to opt-out of non-essential cookies and other tracking technologies, or we only use non-essential cookies or trackers with your prior consent.
You can also authorize, refuse or disable website cookies by changing your browser settings. If you disable a cookie already installed on your browser, it will not be active anymore, but it will not disappear from your browser until the end of its lifespan. Please note that blocking all cookies can render some of the Services unavailable to you or have a negative effect on the performance, efficiency or customization of the Services.
You can opt out of the use of information about your mobile app usage by certain advertising companies through your device settings (“Limit Ad Tracking” on Apple devices and “Opt Out of Personalized Ads” on Android devices).
