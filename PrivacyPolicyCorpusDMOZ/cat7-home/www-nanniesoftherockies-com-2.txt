Privacy Statement, Practice and Policies
To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available via a link from our homepage and at various points throughout our website. If you send us an electronic mail message that contains personal information we will only use this information to respond to your request. We may forward your message on to another department or agency in a better position to answer your question.
You have a right to review the information collected about you by this site. Contact the service provider to review your information.
Information We Collect
We are committed to helping match users who are seeking sitter or nanny services ("Seekers") to users who are providers of sitter or nanny services (" Providers"). Accordingly, we collect user submitted personally identifying information and other information specific to the services requested or provided. As part of providing you our services, we may obtain personal information from the following sources:
• Information you provide to us on forms that you enter on the Site or that you provide to us in writing.
• Information that you provide to us by telephone, such as when you contact our customer care department.
• Information we receive automatically when you visit our web site, such as Internet Protocol (IP) Address, type of browser and operating system used to access our site (“Netscape 4.7”, “Windows 2000”), date and time the user accessed out site, etc.
• Error conditions that may have occurred, including (under some circumstances) arguments which may have been supplied by the user to the program being run.
• Information from third parties, including verification services, payment processing services, and other online and offline sources. For example, this would include information we receive from a third-party verification service in response to a user requesting a background check on themselves. It would also include updated address or contact information that we might use to correct our records so that we can communicate with you more easily.
Registered users and Subscribers will also provide personal contact information including, but not limited to, name, telephone, email, and address information. Under no circumstances does SittersoftheRockies.com or NanniesoftheRockies.com allow for the anonymous registration of a Provider/sitter or parent.
The information we collect may include: first name, last name, city, state, address, ZIP code, phone, email address and other information specific to the service requested or provided. If you become a registered subscriber we may collect your credit card information and billing address. If you become a registered Care Provider, we may collect your date of birth, gender, company name (if applicable), and ZIP codes served. If you request a background check on yourself we may collect your Social Security Number. In addition, if you request a background check on yourself we may obtain criminal background information from a third-party verification service. Use of such a verification service is voluntary.
How We Use the Information We Collect
