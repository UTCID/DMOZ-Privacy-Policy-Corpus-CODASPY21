The email address above is not intended for the submission of requests for access or amendment of Privacy Act covered records. Such requests must be sent in writing to the DOL component that maintains the record in accordance with the procedures in our regulations at 29 C.F.R. § 71.2(a).
The Privacy Program serves to fulfill the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and Department of Labor Privacy Act Regulations. The Privacy Act of 1974 established a "Code of Fair Information Practice" that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.
The Program complies with: Office of Management and Budget circulars A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource & A-108 Federal Agency Responsibilities for Review, Reporting, and Publication under the Privacy Act; the E-Government Act of 2002; and other OMB and DOL policies. The goal of the Program is to ensure and protect individual's privacy while empowering the business and operational needs of DOL.
The following are key components of the DOL Privacy Program:
