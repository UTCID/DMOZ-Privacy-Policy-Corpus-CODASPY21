Third-Party Services
What are third-party services?Third-party services are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity or that involve significant participation of a nongovernment entity. The FTC uses third-party services to assist it in communicating or interacting with the public. These services may be separate websites or may be applications embedded within FTC websites. Some third parties provide these services to the FTC under contract, while others, such as social media sites, do not. Where practicable, we will provide clear notice before you are directed to a third-party service from an FTC website.Privacy Information Regarding Third-Party ServicesWhen interacting with the FTC through a third-party service, the third-party service provider’s privacy policies apply. The following table lists the third-party services currently used by the FTC and provides links to the privacy policies of each third-party service provider. In addition, the table provides links to the FTC’s privacy impact assessment (PIA) for each service. Please note that some services are assessed as part of a larger project and do not have their own PIA, and in other circumstances, a PIA may not be required at all. Generally, the FTC does not collect, disseminate, or maintain any personally identifiable information (PII) that you make available through these services, except as specified in this table.The information that the FTC collects and shares through cookies is anonymous and not personally identifiable.Third Party ServiceThird Party Service Provider’s Privacy Policy FTC’s Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), if requiredDoes the FTC collect, disseminate or maintain any PII made available through this service?Knowledge VisionBrightcovehttp://www.knowledgevision.com/privacy-policyhttps://www.brightcove.com/en/privacyNot required.No. The FTC may collect general analytics such as number of viewers watching live webcasts and videos and length of time watched.Challenge.govhttps://challenge.gov/a/buzz/privacy-policyGSA’s Government-wide Challenge.gov PIANo.Facebookhttp://www.facebook.com/policy.phpFacebook Privacy Impact AssessmentThe FTC may collect comments when hosting an interactive Facebook chat, answering questions, or broadcasting an event, but makes every reasonable attempt to remove any names prior to preserving Agency records.Google Analyticshttps://www.google.com/policies/privacy/Not required.
