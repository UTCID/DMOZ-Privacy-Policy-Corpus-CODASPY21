Customer assistance programs
Electricity and gas suppliers
In New South Wales, electricity and gas retailers are required by law to have a published hardship charter and to operate a customer assistance program. Providers are also offering additional support to customers affected by COVID-19.
Retailers may have slightly different eligibility criteria for their programs. However when a customer is part of their assistance program, they are protected from disconnection and a tailored payment arrangement is developed to help them manage their account.
Differences between the hardship programs of retailers can include the types of incentives the retailer offers customers for making regular payments (eg waiving fees, making co-payments).
According to the Electricity Supply (General) Regulation 2001 (Clause 13AA) and the Gas Supply (Natural Gas Retail Competition) Regulation 2001 a customer hardship charter must contain the following:
processes to identify hardship customers, including identification by the supplier and self-identification by the customer
processes for the early response by the supplier for hardship customers so identified
flexible payment options (including the payment plan operated in accordance with Clause 13A  for the payment of amounts to the supplier by hardship customers
processes to identify appropriate government concession programs and appropriate financial counselling services and to notify hardship customers of those programs and services
an outline of a range of programs that the supplier may use to assist hardship customers
information, in community languages (including Arabic, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Italian, Greek and Spanish, and any other language approved by the supplier after consultation with any relevant customer consultative group), about the availability of interpreter services for the languages concerned and telephone numbers for the services.
From 2 October 2019, all energy retailers are obliged to implement new customer hardship policies that provide clearer and better assistance to customers experiencing financial difficulty. Read more on the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) website. From March 2020, all providers must also adhere to the AERs Statement of Expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
