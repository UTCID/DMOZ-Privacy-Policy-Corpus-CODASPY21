1. About These Terms of Use.
Terms of Use
Healthinsurance.org, LLC (Healthinsurance.org, “we”, “us”, or “our”), operates several websites, including this website (each a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). By using or accessing this Site, a mobile application of this Site, or any of the Site’s Elements (as defined below), you acknowledge that you agree to and are subject to the following terms and conditions of service (the “Terms”). The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Healthinsurance.org as the owner or operator of the Site. You covenant, represent and warrant that you have any and all authorizations as may be necessary to enter into this agreement and that your use of the Site, including provision or use of any Content (defined below), does not violate any applicable law. If you are using the Site on behalf of an employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Terms. You must be a resident of the United States (including its territorial possessions) and at least eighteen (18) years of age to access and use the Site. These provisions form an essential basis of our bargain.

Modified or Additional Terms of Use
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time. We will post a revised version of these Terms on the Sites and the revised Terms will be effective immediately thereafter. Your submission of an inquiry and/or other use of the Sites following the posting of any such change, modification or amendment to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of the amendments. When we post changes to these Terms, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of these Terms. You should periodically review the “last updated” date at the top of these Terms so that you can familiarize yourself with any changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time to take notice of any changes we made, as they are binding on you.
Because we provide a wide range of services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to a specific product, service, or app. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with the Terms, the supplemental terms associated with the product, service, or app govern with respect to your use of such product, service, or app to the extent of the conflict.
Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and Healthinsurance.org are resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration and limit you to claims against Healthinsurance.org on an individual basis.
2. Consent and Privacy.
By clicking on any button indicating an acceptance or agreement to terms, a continuance of processing, a request for information or by making any other submission (“submission”), you understand that you are agreeing to the stated terms and conditions of that submission and that you are submitting an inquiry, as to healthcare plans or another products or services, through this Site and medicareresources.org to insurance agents and companies and other third parties who are customers of our Site, such as marketing partners (each, a “Provider”), to whom your inquiry is transmitted. The inquiry is about quotes for Medicare Advantage, Supplemental Insurance or Prescription Drug Plans. By including your telephone number and/or email address in any submission, you are extending an express invitation and providing your express written consent to Healthinsurance.org/ Medicareresources.org and to each and every Provider you have been matched with: (i) to contact you by telephone at the numbers you have provided (including through auto-dialed, pre-recorded, artificial voice and/or text messages) so they may assist you with your transaction, and you hereby expressly consent to any such calls or texts – even if your phone number is on any corporate, state or national Do Not Call list or registry – and to have such calls monitored and/or recorded for record-keeping, compliance, security and quality-assurance purposes; or (ii) to contact you by email at any email address you provided.
You are not required to provide your consent to be contacted in order to purchase or receive goods or services, however. For SMS and MMS text messaging, message and data rates imposed by your mobile data provider may apply. You represent that all of the information you have provided in your submission is true and complete. By submitting information on healthcare or Medicare plans request form or similar form on our Site, you authorize us to provide such information to Providers in order to help you complete your inquiry (including providing you with information about other products or services in which you have expressed an interest). Additionally, where applicable (such as by submitting a request for healthcare or Medicare plans), you authorize the Providers to verify the accuracy and authenticity of all information supplied by you, both internally and with the assistance of unaffiliated third parties or credit bureaus.
When you use the Site to make a submission, you agree to allow the Site, Healthinsurance.org and our affiliates to add your telephone number and email address to our database of users. You may receive one or more marketing calls or emails from the Site, Healthinsurance.org and/or our affiliates. You may opt not to receive such marketing emails from us at any time. Please review our Privacy Policy for more information regarding our information collection practices and safeguards, and how to opt not to receive such emails. Your use of the Site signifies your acknowledgement of and agreement with our Privacy Policy, which is expressly incorporated into these Terms.
Please note that we may make and retain records documenting your digital interactions with our Sites. We may engage the services of outside vendors to help us perform this compliance activity.
3. Our Services.
PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WE ARE NOT A GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR AN INSURANCE COMPANY, NOR DO WE OFFER MEDICARE OR HEALTH INSURANCE SALES. Instead, the Site is built to offer a guide to the basics of healthcare coverage options, enrollment and eligibility, including a blog that provides analysis of the policy developments that are likely to affect healthcare coverage. Furthermore, the Site acts as a venue to allow Providers to offer health insurance products to consumers (each, a “Prospect”; all Prospects and Providers are referred to together as the Site’s “users”) who have visited one of our Sites or affiliated sites and given their information to be contacted by companies offering health insurance products. We do not offer any products or services described on our Sites, nor do we engage in other consumer financial transactions.
We are not involved in the transaction between any Prospect and any Provider even though we may, through our Site or other affiliate sites, and with each Prospect’s authorization, collect certain information (collectively, a “Lead”) about any Prospect and sell such Lead to a Provider. Consequently, Healthinsurance.org is not responsible for any service-related issues you may experience or inquire about, such as problems receiving a quote for healthcare or medicare plans, coverage questions, or problems managing payments. Any service issue is solely the responsibility of each user. We are an independent contractor for all purposes.
We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. We do not endorse or recommend any Providers, or companies offered by any Provider. We do not guarantee that any of the Providers to whom we forward any Prospect’s information will contact such Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect with any form of help. The Providers that can connect you with healthcare, medicare, or conditional offers may not respond with quotes or offers until they obtain additional information from you. Although Healthinsurance.org is compensated by Providers when we display advertisements for their products or services to you and/or when fill out and submit a form, we do not make any decisions in connection with the offers that may be offered to you. Any compensation from Providers is payment for our services, tools and facilities. Your use of the Site and/or the Service constitutes your agreement with this compensation arrangement. The Site and the products, services and opportunities provided or advertised on and through the Site may not be available in all states, and the availability of such services, products and opportunities offered on and through our Sites may change from time to time without notice. Healthinsurance.org does not guarantee any form of insurance or specific terms or conditions with any Provider. To help the government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify your identity, Providers may obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who filled out a form. For example, they may ask for your name, Social Security Number or driver’s license number, address, date of birth, and other important information, that will allow proper identification of you. During the Provider application process, the Provider may also ask for additional information.
