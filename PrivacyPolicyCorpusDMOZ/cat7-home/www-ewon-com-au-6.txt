No Interest Loan Scheme NILS assistance
No Interest Loan Scheme NILS assistance
The No Interest Loan Scheme (NILS) helps low income households to purchase or replace essential household items.
Loans are available for up to $1,500 for essential goods and services such as fridges, washing machines and medical procedures. As loans are repaid over 12-18 months, the money is 'recycled' and lent out again to other people in the community.
There are number of community agencies in NSW that operate NILS schemes. Find one near you on the NILS website or phone 13 64 57.
