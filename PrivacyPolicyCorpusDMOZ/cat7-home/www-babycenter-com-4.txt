Our Philosophy Safety First The Rules
Our PhilosophyBabyCenter welcomes all, no matter what stage of the parenting journey you are on. From deciding to try, to taking the test; from babies loved and lost and babies learning to crawl and walk; from preschool to grade-school; from the tween years to the teen years and beyond, every member on BabyCenter has the right to share the story of his or her unique parenting journey.Our community is a place of personal free expression, where we value an honest and supportive exchange of ideas and experiences. We encourage celebration of the journey of parenting through sharing of photos and group posts. Safety FirstPlease remember that everything you read in our community areas comes from other members. Because our community is so large, BabyCenter doesn't monitor or verify the information posted by our members. We rely on you to keep us informed of violations. The information posted on our groups and journals, including advice and opinions related to medical matters, is the responsibility of the members who create the posts.
