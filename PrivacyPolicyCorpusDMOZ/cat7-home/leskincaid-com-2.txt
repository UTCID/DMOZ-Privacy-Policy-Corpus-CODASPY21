NOTICE TO OUR CHEF LES KINCAID FANS
(IMPORTANT LEGAL STUFF)
Wow! You actually came to this page. Our lawyers made us include it and made us use a precious button on our home page to get you here. At first, we thought the lawyers were a real pain. But then we read the page. What a Net-wakening! It’s really important stuff. We took the legalese the lawyers wrote and translated it into readable English. So be a smart net-head and read the stuff on this page. It could prevent you from hearing from our lawyers or worse yet, from really nasty people, like prosecutors
.
We run this site so that people like you (and people you like) can use it for personal entertainment, information, education, communication, and cyber gratification. So go ahead and browse around all you like. You can even download stuff from the site but only for non-commercial, personal use. If you do, though, don’t fool around with the copyright and other notices all over the stuff. They’re there for a really good reason. And don’t even think about disturbing, modifying, transmitting, reusing, re-posting, or anything else un-cool with any of the stuff, including the text, images, audio, and video, for public or commercial purposes unless we give you written permission. And it’s not likely we will.
.
If you visit our site, you’re also legally obligated to the terms and conditions listed below and any other law or regulation that applies to the site, the Internet, the world wide web, or Las Vegas, Nevada. You shouldn’t access or browse the site if you have any problems with that, because once you start, there’s no turning back – you are bound by the terms and conditions.
So here’s the scoop:
Rules for Chef Les Kincaid Fans who hang out on our site:
For everyone’s sake, just assume that everything on the site is copyrighted unless we say it isn’t. So you can’t use the stuff except how we say you can on this page or anywhere else on the site without our written permission. And like we said before, it’s not likely we’ll give you permission anyway. In fact, even if we wanted to, the lawyers are likely to veto any deal anyway. So it’s better you don’t even ask.
While we try to include accurate stuff on the site, we’re not promising you it’s accurate. In fact, we’re not promising you anything except fun and entertainment. So if you use stuff on the site, you’re using it at your own risk. Don’t call us if there’s a problem because we assume no liability or responsibility for errors or omissions on the site.
We and anybody else who helped us create, produce, or deliver the site are not liable for any damages you suffer when you use it. In particular, the lawyers want you to know that our disclaimer includes direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages arising out of your access to, or use of the site. Without limiting the foregoing, everything on the site is provided to you:
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the exclusion of implied warranties. We put all of that in quotes because we couldn’t figure out any other way to say it that the lawyers would accept. But here’s the bottom line – we’re not responsible if you’re browsing around and the site damages you or your computer or infects it with any nasty viruses. We sure hope that doesn’t happen, but if it does, don’t call us.
These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to its choice of law principles to the contrary. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms and conditions shall be filed only in the State and Federal courts residing in Clark County, Nevada, and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Notice.
If you don’t want the world to know something, don’t post in on the site in any bulletin board or anyplace else. That’s because anything you disclose to us is ours. That’s right – ours. So we can do anything we want with the stuff you post. We can reproduce it, disclose it, transmit it, publish it broadcast it, and post it someplace else. We can even send it to your mother (as soon as we find her address). Not only that, we can even use ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques you post anyway we want to, including, developing, manufacturing and marketing products or other stuff using the information you post.
Pictures of people or places shown on the site are either or property or someone else’s property. You or any of your net-friends can’t use it unless we said you can on this page or somewhere else on the site. And guess what – we won’t say yes. So be careful, Love Chef Les fan, because unauthorized use may violate all sorts of nasty laws. Be smart, keep the stuff you download to yourself.
Parental Permission
I strongly recommend that all children ask for their parent’s permission before viewing any web site.
There are also a lot of trademarks, logos, and service marks on the site that either we own or we’re using with someone else’s permission. So don’t think you have any kind of license or right to use them, because you don’t and we’re not about to give you one. If you don’t leave them alone and mess with our trademarks, logos and service marks on our site, we’ll probably go ballistic – so will the companies that own the other trademarks, logos and service marks. That means that we’re likely to sue you or to ask a prosecutor to come after you for messing around with our property or the property of others.
You’ll probably notice we’ve linked our site to lots of others. While that’s cool, it doesn’t mean we’ve looked at all those sites, much less checked them out periodically to see what’s going on. So don’t blame us if some site you link to is bad or has stuff on it that offends you or your pets. Go ahead and link, but remember, you’re doing it at your own risk.
If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
That brings us to what you do on our own site. While we may listen in on chat groups, or look at the posting in our discussion groups or on our bulletin boards, we take no responsibility and assume no liability for the content of those locations or for any mistakes, defamation, libel, slander, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography, or profanity you might encounter when you visit such places on our site. And don’t be stupid by posting or transmitting any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic nasty, mean, or profane material or any material that law enforcement types may consider a criminal offense, get someone in court on a civil lawsuit, or for that matter violate any law – anywhere, anytime. Notwithstanding any of these terms and conditions, leskincaid.com reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use this Website, and to block or prevent future access to and use of this Website.
While we certainly respect your privacy, we have no choice but to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court which might ask us who might have posted nasty stuff on our site. We’re also allowed to change this page and anything else on the site anytime we want to. That’s because it’s ours and we have the programmers who can do it. If we do change the page, then you’re bound by those changes, too, whenever you visit our site.
Finally, we reserve the right to pull the plug on anybody who abuses his or her visit to our site. If you engage in any conduct that is rude, offensive, nasty, mean, abusive, defamatory, etc., (you get the picture), your access to our site may be terminated and you may be prevented from re-accessing our site. We reserve the right to amend at any time any policies governing this Website, including this Notice and leskincaid.com Privacy Policy, by posting the amended terms and providing notice of such amendments. The amended terms shall be effective immediately after they are initially posted on this Website. If you do not accept the amended terms, you should cease using this Website. So, be courteous and enjoy our site!
Sorry, if this all sounds kind of mean and undiplomatic, you should have seen what the lawyers gave to us in the first place. We had to remind them that human torture and sacrifice were outlawed in the United States.
