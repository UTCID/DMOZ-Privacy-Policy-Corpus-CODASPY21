I'm beyond satisfied with the service I have received from MMI. Even though I was embarrassed about my situation, your reps never made me feel badly about myself and they made me feel confident that I would reach my goal. Thank you!
Jaime B.
Prior to making my first phone call to MMI I was very skeptical, but after talking to the representative I knew that this is what I truly needed to do. It is definitely a life changing program and without the use of any credit cards you have to face the fact that if you can't afford something you save up for it or you just don t buy it. Thank you so much for helping me learn this most important lesson.
Dianne F.
Great support for your financial management. Money Management helps to get your credit back on track.
Doreen B.
I had over $24,000 in credit card debt and was paying over $900 per month and drowning. My adviser at MMI helped me lower the payment and come up with a plan that helped me get rid of that debt. It took just over 3 years, but I did it! I have NO credit cards and have managed to not incur any more debt, even at Christmas with four teenagers! My credit took a bit of a hit, but it bounced back and I have had a score over 800 for the last 2 years. It was a long road, and difficult at times. But I know for sure that I would still be paying off those credit cards if not for the help I got from MMI. My advice: just do it!
Christina
MMI customer service is amazing. They are very caring and helpful. We would recommend them to anyone who needs financial counseling.
Larissa B.
Everyone that I have talked to has been wonderful thus far! This has been a very easy & pleasant experience. MMI has taken a big part of my stress away!! Thank you so much.
