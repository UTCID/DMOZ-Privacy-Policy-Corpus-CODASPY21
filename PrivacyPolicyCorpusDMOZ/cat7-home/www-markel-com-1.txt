Insurance coverages are underwritten by member companies of Markel Corporation, including Markel American Insurance Company; Glen Allen, VA.  Not all products and services may be available in all jurisdictions, and the coverage provided by any insurer is subject to the actual terms and conditions of the policies issued. Certain products and services are provided through various non-admitted insurance company subsidiaries of Markel Corporation and are offered through licensed surplus lines brokers. Non-admitted insurance carriers do not generally participate in state guaranty funds and insureds are therefore not protected by such funds.
