Privacy
Electricity, gas and water providers are bound by the Privacy Act 1988. This Act sets out the ways providers can deal with customers’ personal information.
Personal information is information which identifies an individual or makes the individual reasonably identifiable, such as your name, address or account number. This Act controls the way providers collect, use and give out information about you. It also means that you can access information providers keep about you, and have the opportunity to correct any errors. The Privacy Act includes the National Privacy Principles, which cover:
collection of personal information
use and disclosure of personal information
accuracy of personal information
access to personal information
correction of errors in personal information
dealing with sensitive personal information
Most providers have a copy of their privacy policy available on their website. These privacy policies provide more detailed information about the ways in which each provider agrees to protect information about you. If you would like further information about privacy, or if you would like to make a complaint about a privacy issue, you can:
