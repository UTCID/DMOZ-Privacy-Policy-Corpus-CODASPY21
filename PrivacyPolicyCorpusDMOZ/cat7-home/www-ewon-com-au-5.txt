Financial counselling
A financial counsellor can help if you are having trouble making payments on your energy or water accounts, or negotiating an affordable payment plan with your supplier.
Financial counsellors provide a free community service and they work in community organisations that assist consumers who are experiencing financial problems.
A financial counsellor can negotiate or advocate on your behalf, and they can develop a budget which can help you manage your finances and stay on top of your bills. A report from a financial counsellor can help show what you can afford to pay towards a energy or water debt.
