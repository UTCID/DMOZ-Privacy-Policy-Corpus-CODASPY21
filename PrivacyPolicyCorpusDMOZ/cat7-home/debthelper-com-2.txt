First Time Homebuyer Program
Register for Online (Valid for Some Programs)
Online Home Buyer Education Courses are acceptable for some but not all down payment assistance, subsidy or other programs that require Pre-Purchase Home Buyer Education. It is up to you to verify that the completion of this course will meet the education requirements for any program you are considering.
If you are using more than one program, online education must be allowed by every program that is involved. If you change or add programs during your home buying process, you may still be required to attend a live, in-person workshop.
To register for one or both of these online courses, read and check the box below.
*By checking this box, you are acknowledging that you understand that once you have enrolled in either of these courses, you will not receive a refund of the course fee and that you understand that you could still be required to attend a live workshop if so required by any entity involved in your purchase.
*By checking this box you are acknowledging that you have read and agree to the terms and conditions found in our disclosure statement and privacy policy.
To learn more about the topics covered in these courses, please review our Homebuyer Education Curriculum.
