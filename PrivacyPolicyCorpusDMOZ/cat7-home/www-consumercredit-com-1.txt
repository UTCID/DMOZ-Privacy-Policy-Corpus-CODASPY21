American Consumer Credit Counseling (ACCC) is a nonprofit organization offering free credit counseling sessions for consumers throughout the country. For anyone considering debt settlement program or working with credit card settlement companies, our counselors can explain the details of the credit card settlement process, discuss the debt settlement credit impact, outline the worst and best debt settlement scenarios and discuss other pros and cons of debt settlement. We can also help consumers explore the benefits of a debt management plan vs debt settlement, and answer questions like “How bad does debt settlement hurt credit?” and “Is debt settlement a good idea?” as well as “Does debt settlement work?”
