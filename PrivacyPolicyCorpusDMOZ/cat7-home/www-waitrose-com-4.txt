3. Online shopping
General information and payment security
Delivery/collection restrictions
Delivery is available in restricted areas.
Collection for orders placed via Waitrose.com is available from selected branches.
Collection for Food Made to Order is available from all branches except selected Convenience stores.
We reserve the right to restrict deliveries in certain areas. This includes the right to withdraw our services to individual customers' addresses if you are repeatedly unavailable to take delivery of your shopping at your chosen slot time or in other exceptional circumstances.
Delivery and collection arrangements
Deliveries and collection times vary by branch.  At the point at which you place your order, the full list of available delivery/collection times will be shown.
Products must be signed for at the delivery address (or upon collection), by you or by your nominated representative.  Products will not be left unattended, for example in a garage.  If, in the unfortunate situation no one is available to accept and sign for your delivery, a card will be left by our driver asking you to contact your local Waitrose & Partners branch or our Customer Care Team at your earliest convenience to arrange an alternative delivery time. Redelivery is subject to availability. If you fail to rearrange delivery, your order will be cancelled.
If Waitrose & Partners delivers outside the specified delivery period and no one is available to accept the products, a card will be left asking you to contact Waitrose & Partners Customer Care Team. There will be no charge for the rearranged delivery, and we will do our very best to get your shopping delivered as soon as is practically possible. In cases where it is not possible to offer redelivery, your order will be cancelled and the cost of your order and any other associated charges will be refunded to you.
If you have not contacted us to rearrange a failed delivery or collection within 24 hours, your order will be cancelled and the cost of your order (excluding the cost of perishable items and any other associated charges) will be refunded to you.
If your nominated representative is not aged 18 or above, we will not deliver any products, including those that are Restricted Items (as defined in section 1 "Use of the website" above).  Our drivers apply our "Challenge 25 Policy" and so proof of age will be requested if the person receiving the products looks under 25 years old.
Pursuant to the Licensing Act 2003 it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 to buy, or attempt to buy, intoxicating liquor, or for any person over the age of 18 to buy intoxicating liquor on behalf of any person under the age of 18, subject to a maximum fine on conviction of £1,000.
Waitrose.com is committed to upholding both their legal and social obligations as a retailer of intoxicating liquor and other Restricted Items. In order to achieve this, Waitrose.com has introduced a number of control checks throughout the purchase and physical distribution process (e.g. confirming your date of birth and requesting formal identification of anyone who they consider to be younger than the relevant age (i.e. 25 years old pursuant to our Challenge 25 Policy) who is a buyer or recipient of the delivery.
In accepting these Terms and Conditions you agree to provide Waitrose & Partners with truthful and accurate information and act in accordance with them and legal obligations including the Licensing Act of 2003. For the purposes of the Licensing Act 2003, any alcohol included in your order will be appropriated by you to the contract at the same central, licensed premises at which your payment is taken and where the contract for sale is made. This simply means that the sale of any alcohol included in your order will take place at such premises. This has no practical effect on you other than to improve our fulfilment of your orders that contain alcohol, nor does it impact on our policies aimed at preventing deliveries of alcohol to minors.
Our refund policy
Our Goodwill policy
In addition to your statutory rights under consumer laws in the United Kingdom, we have a goodwill policy. Under our goodwill policy, within 35 days after you have received your products from us, you are not entirely satisfied with them you can return them to the Branch from which you bought them (or where return to the original Branch is no longer reasonably possible, then you can return them to your nearest Branch) together with your proof of purchase and we will refund you for or replace/exchange the returned items even though you may no longer have a right under law for us to do so. We will refund the value of the items by using the same payment method which you used when you bought them from us, except where you do not have adequate proof of purchase. Where inadequate proof of purchase is not provided by you, we may instead choose to refund the value of the returned items by providing you with a Waitrose & Partners gift card or vouchers for the equivalent value of the returned items. Our goodwill policy is however discretionary and some items are excluded from it such as items that are used or damaged by you, items where the seal or packaging has been broken by you, perishable items including food and flowers and made to order or personalised items.
Your legal rights
Your other legal rights to refund, repair or replacement under consumer laws
Under consumer laws in the United Kingdom, we must supply our goods to you as described, fit for purpose and they must be of satisfactory quality. If we supply services to you, then we must supply them with reasonable care and skill.
During the expected lifespan of the product your legal rights under consumer laws in the United Kingdom entitle you to the following:
- up to 30 days: if you have changed your mind about the product you have purchased then unless the product is faulty, you have 30 days to return it in its original condition e.g. kept in the original packaging and labels and is undamaged and unused.
- up to six months: if your goods can't be repaired or replaced, then you're entitled to a full refund, in most cases.
- over six months: if a fault develops after the first 6 months then you may be able to claim a refund or have the product repaired or replaced. However, we may require proof that the product is faulty.
- up to six years: if your goods do not last a reasonable length of time you may be entitled to some money back.
Online purchases: Customers must inform the retailer that they wish to cancel within 14 days of receiving the goods. Customers then have 14 days to return the goods once the retailer has been informed. Refunds will be given within 14 days of receiving the goods back.
Under consumer laws in the United Kingdom, if your product is digital content (for example music, DVDs or computer software), if it is faulty, then you are entitled to a repair or a replacement or if the fault can't be fixed, or if it hasn't been fixed within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience, you can get some or all of your money back.  If you can show that the fault has damaged your device and we have not used reasonable care and skill, you may be entitled to a repair or compensation.
If your have bought services from us, under consumer laws in the United Kingdom you can ask us to repeat or fix a service if it is not carried out with reasonable care and skill, or you can get some money back if we cannot fix it.  If you have not agreed a price with us beforehand, what you are asked to pay must be reasonable. If you have not agreed a time beforehand, then it must be carried out within a reasonable time.
If you wish to exercise your legal rights to reject products you must return them in person to us (either where you bought them or post them back to us or, if they are not suitable for posting, allow us to collect them from you).  We will pay the costs of postage or collection.
There may be some exceptions to these rights such as for those products and services listed below where, for reasons of hygiene, safety or under law we are not able to refund or exchange items unless faulty, not as described, not fit for purpose or of satisfactory quality:   Chilled and Frozen Products (including Food Made To Order); Baby Food and Milk; Gift Cards, Vouchers and e-top ups; Fireworks; Lottery Tickets and Scratch Cards; Tobacco, Cigarettes, Tobacco Products and Cigars; unsealed DVDs, CDs or Video Games, Unsealed Earrings or Hair Accessories; Unsealed Bedding.
None of the above affects your statutory rights.
You have additional rights of cancellation if you order products online.  These are described below in the section called "Cancellation rights".
Cancellation rights

If you wish to exercise your right of cancellation for products that you have ordered online, you are obliged to retain possession of the products and take reasonable care of them or return them to us.
If you decide to cancel products that you have ordered online, we will reimburse to you (by the method used to pay for the original transaction) the amount in relation to products to which cancellation rights apply.  This includes the cost of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you choose a type of delivery other than our standard and least expensive method of delivery). We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any products supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.  We will make the reimbursement no later than 14 days after the day we receive back from you any products supplied.

There is a limit of ten gift vouchers per transaction for Groceries, Food Made to Order, Cellar, Florist and Gifts.

All customers collecting shopping, whether the registered customer or a third party, will be asked to provide a form of identification for the person who is paying for the shopping. The identification must match the cardholder name shown in the payment details on the checkout page. The card itself will not be required.
Through your bank or credit card provider, you may be entitled to cancel a payment or have such sums re-credited to your payment card where fraudulent use of your payment card has been made by another person not acting on your behalf.
Payment Security Policy
We will treat all of your personal data as confidential. We will keep it on a secure server and fully comply with all applicable privacy regulations and consumer legislation. If you would like to read more on how we collect, where we collect or how we use your personal information, please see our Privacy Notice here. You can also find information in the Privacy Notice on how to stop receiving marketing information.
Credit Card safety when shopping online
The Waitrose & Partners online food shopping service uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us.  This technology is designed to minimise the risk that someone else could breach your privacy when shopping online with us.
We provide you with an option to store your card details with us, so that you can order from us again without needing to type your details in. To assist to keep your card information secure, we only display the last four digits of your stored card number on our website to you, when logged into your 'My Waitrose' account. If you do not wish to store your card details with us, you can instead enter these in each time you place an order with the Waitrose & Partners online food shopping service.
Your payment details are held by us in a secure encrypted server and access to this data is secured internally within Waitrose & Partners. We encrypt card numbers by using a security system which is a common standard relied on by the main financial and banking institutions called Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard).
Errors/shortages, not fulfilling orders and quantity limits
If there are errors or shortages in what we supply to you, we ask that these are brought to the attention of Waitrose & Partners Customer Care Team (using the contact details set out above in section 1) as soon as possible and preferably within seven days after the delivery or collection.
Waitrose & Partners may decline to fulfill any order or we may limit the number of units of products per customer or order (including for any bulk purchases of items on promotion or special offers). This applies to all orders  whether through our online shopping and delivery or collection, our 'shop-in-branch and we deliver' service or in branch.
Nutritional information
Waitrose & Partners has produced nutritional information on this website for the general information of the public. It contains information gathered from various sources and, although Waitrose & Partners believes it to be accurate at the time of publication, to the extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise set out in these Terms and Conditions, Waitrose & Partners accepts no responsibility for, and makes no representation or gives any warranty or undertaking express or implied as to the accuracy or completeness of the information.
General Pricing Policy
Prices quoted are always estimated for a variety of reasons listed below, but you will always be charged the in-store price on the day of delivery or collection. You have the right to return any product with the driver or directly to the branch if you have any issues with price(s) charged and we will refund the amount that you have been charged for that product.
Prices and the availability of special offers may vary for future dated deliveries and collections.
All special offer discounts, such as Mixed Case Wine Offer and multi-value offers, will be deducted in-store.
Where Multi-value offers apply to a set of differently priced items, the saving or free item applies to the cheapest item or items.
The unit price for products that are weighed and displayed on the site are calculated on drained weight where applicable.
Weighed items such as fruit may vary in weight from that ordered.
Where an item is unavailable and you have indicated that you will accept substitutions, an alternative will be supplied that may affect the price that you pay. If we substitute an item with a more expensive one, youll only pay the lower of the two prices (if the item we are substituting was of a fixed weight and therefore has a known price). Upon delivery or collection you will be made aware of unavailable items and their substitutes. You have the right to reject any substitutes offered and we will refund the amount that you have been charged for that product.
Where the only stock available of a product  line is reduced in price in branch, the product will be supplied but at zero price.
The prices stated on the site are inclusive of any VAT payable.
Charges for delivery and collection for online shopping and "click
and collect"
You will not be charged for your shopping to be picked and packed.
Charges apply for certain deliveries and collections for your online shopping orders or using the "click and collect" service unless you qualify for a free delivery or collection service. Free delivery applies to selected postcodes only.
Unless ordering only Food Made to Order for collection in branch (where there is no minimum spend criteria), to qualify for free delivery or collection, you must meet thee below minimum spend on groceries and/or Food Made to Order when shopping online:
- £40 for deliveries; or
- £40 for collection in branch.
We reserve the right to amend our delivery charges and minimum spend requirements.  They will be clearly defined during the checkout process.
Charges for delivery using the 'shop-in-branch and we deliver' service
Some of our branches offer a 'shop-in-branch and we deliver' service. Charges may apply for this delivery service.
Payment
If you have booked a Waitrose.com order for collection and no payment card details have been entered on the checkout page you will be asked to pay for the products on collection. If you have booked a delivery and invalid card details have been entered on the checkout page Waitrose & Partners Customer Care Team will contact you to request payment details over the telephone before delivery can be made.

6. Price match
At Waitrose & Partners, we believe that you should be able to shop for a fair price without compromising on either quality or service. We know price is really important, and thats why we put so much effort into getting it right. We have been regularly checking the prices of some of our competitors since 2006, and since 2010 we have committed to be the same price as Tesco - using them as a benchmark for the supermarket industry - on more than 1,000 everyday branded products, week in, week out, excluding promotions. As you would expect from Waitrose & Partners, there are no gimmicks, no coupons to redeem against a later shop, and no need to check your receipt online. We simply match the prices on the shelf, so you benefit immediately when you pay.
We do this by regularly checking www.tesco.com for the price of branded products that both Tesco and Waitrose & Partners sell. Tesco prices are checked online at www.tesco.com for a postcode served by large Tesco stores, so prices checked will exclude Tesco Metro and Tesco Express.
Everyday branded products are selected from our food and drink grocery ranges. For Price Match marked products, standard retail prices are matched on identical branded products at www.tesco.com. This excludes own-label lines, multi-buys and temporary promotions or any other special offers. In line with our responsible approach to selling alcohol, we will not price match on any alcohol product where to do so would mean selling below cost. If Tesco has an item on a multi-buy promotion (for example, 'buy one get one free'), we will still match the single unit selling price of the item but not offer the free product. If Tesco reduce the price of a product which is pending temporary promotion within Waitrose & Partners we remove the product from the selection of products on which we price match.
The offer does not apply to Little Waitrose stores or Waitrose & Partners stores in the Channel Islands, or to Welcome Break and Shell concessions.
However, our commitment to value is about much more than competitive prices, its about all those extra things that are worth a lot - like great customer service, or feeling confident that the product youve just bought will taste delicious, and the knowledge that we source responsibly.
We may withdraw from this policy at any time without notice.
For further information on the price comparison please contact Customer Services and Support at Waitrose & Partners, Bracknell, Berkshire RG12 8YA.
