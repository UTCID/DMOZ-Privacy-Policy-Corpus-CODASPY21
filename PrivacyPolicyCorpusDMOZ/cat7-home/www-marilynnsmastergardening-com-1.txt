Privacy
This page collects data on its visitors. I promise not to use this data
to cause you spams.. I also will
not hit you with ten trillion email ads, er, "service announcements".
The only personally identifiable data I have about you is what you tell
me, and what's in my site's log files. The log files provide me with information like visitors' IP numbers, browser versions, operating systems, and if the visitor has certain "browser plug-ins" installed. I would rather be gardening than trying to track down someone's IP number, so there's nothing to worry about!!!
I advertise/link to other sites from this site. I have no control over any sites besides my own. All other sites are under the control of other entities, and I am not responsible for their actions.
I promise to refrain from selling, leasing, or otherwise giving out any personally identifiable (e-mail address, etc.) information about any visitors, except in the rare chance someone actually subpoenas it! (Fat chance on a gardening site getting a subpoena, ha, ha! ;-) )
