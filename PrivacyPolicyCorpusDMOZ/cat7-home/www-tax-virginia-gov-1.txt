Protecting Your Privacy

Information Collection
Virginia law requires that state bodies not collect personal information about citizens unless it is required to provide services for the citizen. When information is collected, it must be protected from unauthorized access or disclosure and citizens have the right to know how the information is collected, used and who has access to it.
