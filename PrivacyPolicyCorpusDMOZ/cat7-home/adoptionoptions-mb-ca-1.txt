From Adoptive Parents
Our Adoption Journey
Our journey to adoption started as most others; we just wanted to have children. We have been blessed to know all 3 of our children from the earliest days in their lives.  It never mattered to us who was adopted and who was biological; they are simply ours. We are watching them all grow (too quickly) into independent and insightful young people. The adoption path was not part of our initial plan, but we can’t imagine life any other way. We are grateful everyday for our family and for those who helped us build it.
