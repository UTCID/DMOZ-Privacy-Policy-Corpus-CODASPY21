Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
Non-Personal Identification Information
We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, IP address, search query, type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.
Web Browser Cookies
TheHomeAutomationStore.com and our marketing agencies use
Google Analytics and Clicky Analytics to collect the following information when
users access or interact with our Website: This information may include, among
other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or

(anonymized for residents of the European Economic Area), unique device
identifier ("Device Identifier") for any device (computer, mobile

assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our
servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service
providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with
information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the
Service.
The TheHomeAutomationStore.com Site may use
"cookies" to enhance User experience. The User's web browser places
cookies on their device for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track
information about them. The User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies,
or to alert the User when cookies are being sent. If a User does so, note that
some parts of our Site may not function properly. We use cookies and other
technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to
our services. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns
on our Site, to make our Site more usable as well as to study the effectiveness
of our customer communications.
TheHomeAutomationStore.com and our marketing agencies use
the information from Google Analytics and Clicky Analytics in order to assemble
statistics regarding usage of our Website as well as to help us understand how

improve it; to help with customer service needs (such as troubleshooting issues
that users report to us); and for research and analytical purposes such as
service performance; customer behavior and common navigation through the
TheHomeAutomationStore.com Website. Google Analytics data is then fed into our
Google AdWords account in order to help us monitor how our internet advertising
is performing.

Our Site, powered by Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, is also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users.
Sharing Your Personal Information
We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others.

From time to time, we may use agents or contractors who will have access to your personal information to perform services for us (such as database/website maintenance & marketing); however, they are required by us to keep the information confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services for The Home Automation Store. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys.
