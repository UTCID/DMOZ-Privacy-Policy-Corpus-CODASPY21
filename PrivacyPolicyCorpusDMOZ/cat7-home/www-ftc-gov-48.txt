Federal Trade Commission Privacy Impact Assessments
What is a Privacy Impact Assessment? A Privacy Impact Assessment, or PIA, is an analysis of how personally identifiable information is collected, used, shared, and maintained. The purpose of a PIA is to demonstrate that program managers and system owners at the FTC have consciously incorporated privacy protections throughout the development life cycle of a system or program. PIAs are required by the E-Government Act of 2002, which was enacted by Congress in order to improve the management and promotion of Federal electronic government services and processes. PIAs allow us to communicate more clearly with the public about how we handle information, including how we address privacy concerns and safeguard information. The FTC's PIAs are posted on this Web site upon completion. We work hard to draft our PIAs in plain language and in a manner that allows the public to understand our activities. PIAs are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that they are accurate and up-to-date. If you have any questions about our Privacy Impact Assessments, please contact the FTC's Chief Privacy Officer.
