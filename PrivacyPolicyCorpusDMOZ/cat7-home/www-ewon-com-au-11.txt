We're here to help during COVID-19
We know the winter months combined with COVID-19 are leading to increased energy bills, but there’s support available. Watch our Ombudsman, Janine Young, explain how to get assistance during these difficult times.
If you're having trouble paying your bill, contact your energy retailer. If you're not happy their response, or you need independent advice, contact our office.
