The Privacy Act of 1974 establishes certain controls over any personal information collected by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and how it is used.

The OCC respects your privacy. We do not collect or store information about members of the public who call or write the agency or visit our website, unless you identify yourself so that we can respond to an inquiry or request from you.
We use your personal identifying information only for the purpose for which it is originally collected.
We maintain your personal identifying information in secure computer systems and limit employee access to those with a business reason to see it.
We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the OCC, except when compelled by law or in connection with a criminal investigation (as explained below).

These cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. They do not collect personal information on visitors, and they are erased as soon as you close your web browser. No PII about you is maintained as a result of a temporary or session cookie.

Formal written complaint to the OCC about a national bank or its operating subsidiary:
Customer Assistance Group

Suite 3450
Houston, TX 77010
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request:
Comptroller of the Currency
Disclosure Officer
Suite 3E-218
Mail Stop 6W-11
Washington, DC 20219
Fax requests: (202) 649-6160
To request electronically, use our online FOIA website
Building and General Correspondence Address:
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
400 7th Street SW, Suite 3E-218
Washington, D.C. 20219
When making an inquiry, request, or complaint that requires follow-up: If you are making an inquiry or request or filing a complaint that warrants supervisory or other attention, we may need to share your information with others.
We may need to bring your correspondence to the attention of our attorneys, examiners, or other staff members as appropriate.
If necessary to address the issue, we may need to share your correspondence with other federal, state, or local agencies responsible for administering or enforcing laws, rules, or regulations, or for investigating known or suspected violations of laws, rules, or regulations, such as the Justice Department or state bank regulators.
Under limited circumstances, such as a request from Congress or a private individual acting with appropriate legal authority, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.
If you file a complaint about a national bank or its affiliate, we typically provide your customer identification information along with the complaint to the affected bank. This information is usually necessary for the bank to be able to investigate and correct a problem. In turn, a bank sometimes provides the OCC with additional information about you when it responds to our inquiry. All this information is securely retained in OCC records.
Privacy Impact AssessmentsShow
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conducts a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) on information systems that collect personally identifiable information from the public. We prepare PIAs to
ensure that information handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy;
determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system; and
examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.
Also, PIAs confirm that we use the information for the purpose intended, that the information remains timely and accurate, that it is protected while we have it, and that we hold it only as long as we need it.

Privacy Act System of Records Notices (SORN) Show
System of Records Notices (SORNs)
A System of Records is a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish notice of its systems of records in the Federal Register.
What Is a SORN?
A SORN is a formal notice to the public published in the Federal Register that identifies the purpose for which PII is collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by the department.
When Is a SORN required?
A SORN is required when the department has a system of records as defined above. In some instances, the Department may have an existing SORN that covers a collection of systems or programs. During the Privacy Threshold Analysis and Privacy Impact Assessment processes, our office, in coordination with the bureau privacy officer, will help determine whether a new SORN is required.
