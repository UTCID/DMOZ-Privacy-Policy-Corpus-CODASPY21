You can at any time change or withdraw your consent from the Cookie Policy page on our website.
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the following rights:

Children’s Privacy
This Web Site is intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files. If we otherwise obtain knowledge that we have personal information about a child under 13 in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files so that it is not in retrievable form.
DATA SECURITY
We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss, and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. We use technology, controls and restrictions on employee access to help safeguard your personal information. The credit card information or other account information that you input at the time of purchase is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure communications. If your browser does not support SSL, or if you do not want to send your credit card information via the web, please contact us.
Notwithstanding our data security procedures, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control, and we cannot absolutely guarantee the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information exchanged between you and us through this Web Site. We make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.
PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES
When you use our Web Site, you may interact with or link to third parties that operate their own web sites and have their own privacy policies. Also, companies with whom we share your information have their own privacy policies. Other companies that may place advertisements on our sites may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of these third parties.
USE OF COOKIES AND TAGGING
Like many commercial websites, we analyze how readers use this site through what is known as “cookie” technology. A “cookie” is a small text file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is not an app or program and has no ability to read the data residing on your computer. We cannot instruct it to execute functions or take any actions. Cookies do not provide us with any personal data or information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
Similarly, we use what is known as “client-side page tagging” to write certain information about the page and the visitor to a log when a page is rendered by your web browser. This technique is also commonly used on commercial websites. “Tagging” does result in a small amount of JavaScript running on your computer, but it is limited to providing information about the page that you are requesting and the configuration of your browser. It will not read any of your data files, or execute any additional programs. It does not extract any personal information about you, such as your name or address. You can prevent tagging by disabling JavaScript in your browser, but that may prevent you from using all of our website’s functions.
You can learn more about the cookies in use on our website on our Cookie Policy page.
DATA SECURITY
We use tools from Google, Adobe and others to help collect aggregate data, such as browser type, connection speed, referring/exit pages, device type, date/time stamp, and the number of clicks to help us analyze trends, administer the site and make improvements. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information you may share with us.
Google and Adobe may also provide anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites (such as age and gender) to help us improve the content on our web site, refine our products and provide information about our other products and services that might be of interest to you.
You can obtain more information about this practice and to identify your choices about not having this information used by Google and Adobe from their respective web sites. You can opt-out of cookie-based tracking at any time by simply clearing your browser’s cookie cache or activating your web browser’s “do not track” function.
We may partner with advertising networks who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information advertising networks collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time. You may also visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
