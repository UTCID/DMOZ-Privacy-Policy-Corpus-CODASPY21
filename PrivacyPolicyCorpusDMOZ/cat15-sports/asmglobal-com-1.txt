How We Process Personal Data for Commercial Purposes
We and certain third parties process Personal Data we hold for certain purposes, depending on the context of collection and your rights and choices:
Marketing communications
To create marketing profiles
In connection with online advertising, including targeted advertising
Data sales
Consumer Profiles
Entertainment is personal, and we are always working to help you have the best in-Venue experience. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend products and services that are personalized to our prior customers, we may create a “Consumer Profile” by linking together and analyzing Personal Data collected in the following contexts:
When you make a purchase or other transaction through our Service
When you attend our Events Venues
When you access or use our Digital Services
Cookies and other tracking technologies
When you enter a contest or other promotion
When you contact us or submit information to us
Feedback and Surveys
We may also augment Consumer Profiles with Personal Data that we create (such as Inference Data) or that we receive from Our Group or third parties, and may include Personal Data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, information about when you have visited our Venues in the past and which parts of the building you visited or events you attended, demographic data and data from your social media profiles.
We use Consumer Profiles for our legitimate interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of people who have purchased tickets for a particular future event that we promote, operate, provide services for, or that is hosted at one of our Venues, and then compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in our database who have similar Personal Data to the original purchasers, we may then target marketing about that event to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending direct marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically. We may also use this information for other Commercial Purposes.
Marketing Communications
Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, certain third parties) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us. For example, we may process Contact Data and Identity Data when you opt-in to receive marketing communications via email or SMS. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications without opt-in, for example, you may receive email marketing communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with or submission of User Content to us. Similarly, we may also collect Device/Network Data and Contact Data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate Inference Data based on these interactions.
Marketing communications may be personalized or customized based on your Consumer Profile. We may also process this Personal Data for targeted advertising. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising only with appropriate consent.
Targeted Advertising
Our Group, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for targeted advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from Personalization, Consumer Profiles, and Marketing Communications. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a Consumer Profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Inference Data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.
We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).
Data Sales
Certain Commercial Processing purposes involve “sales” of data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” (as defined by applicable law) certain Personal Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors, conduct targeted advertising, or we may sell or grant access to Personal Data to our marketing partners, artists, promoters, and other advertisers.
See the California Rights & Disclosures section for a list of categories of Personal Data sold.

International Transfers of Your Personal Data
If you are located outside the US, your Personal Data may be transferred to and/or processed in a location outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of our Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services.
Some countries outside the EEA do not have laws that protect your privacy rights as extensively as those in the EEA. However, if we do transfer your Personal Data to other territories, we will put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data are properly protected and processed only in accordance with this Policy. We may transfer Personal Data from the EEA to the US using the EU standard contractual clauses, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program, under Binding Corporate Rules, or other lawful mechanisms.
