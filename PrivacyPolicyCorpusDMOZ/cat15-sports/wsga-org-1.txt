Privacy Policy/Terms of Use
WSGA Website Privacy Policy
Introduction. Welcome to the Wisconsin State Golf Association Website (also referred to as the “Website” and “Site”). This Online Privacy Policy discloses our practices regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that we may collect about you through this Site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this Site.
Your Consent. By using this Site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use and any specific provisions of this Site that may be presented at the time information is collected.
Our Policy Regarding Children. The Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) from children under the age of thirteen. Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), which became effective April 21, 2000, we will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 13 submits information to us though the Site, we will not use that information for any purpose.
Active Information Collection. This Site actively collects information from you by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail and online registration. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information. In the event that this Site may require you to submit information to receive a benefit or service, you will be informed at each information collection point what information is required.
Passive Information Collection. As you navigate through this Site and/or receive emails in connection with this Site, certain information may be passively collected (i.e., gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, including, without limitation, those described below:
Cookies. As with many Websites, this Site uses standard Internet technology called “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. By themselves, cookies do not provide us any information about your identity, and we do not use them to gather personally identifiable information about you.
We use cookies to collect IP addresses and/or automatic information for purposes of system administration. Automatic information is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Site. Automatic information may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such information. We aggregate this information to help us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular and what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content, among other things.
In addition, when you visit the WSGA Site to create a personal profile or otherwise register for a WSGA sponsored competition by completing an online registration form, we may use cookies that permit our computer to recognize you the next time you return to the WSGA Site in order to facilitate the online application process.
You may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by adjusting your settings on your browser.
Use and Disclosure of Information. We use information you provide us to improve the content of our Website, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. For instance, WSGA members can sign up to receive their official handicap revisions by e-mail. To sign up for this service, WSGA members are requested to send their name, e-mail address, WSGA number and home club name. This information is then used to communicate official handicap revisions to the respective member. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you via e-mail about WSGA news and other announcements or changes to the Site. In addition, we may contact you periodically with information regarding golf competitions or WSGA news or events. Also, as a member of the WSGA, you may receive an occasional email from a WSGA sponsor or partner.
We may also transfer aggregated information we collect in connection with the sale, merger, or transition of our system to a third-party. Email addresses will not be rented to third parties.
If you provide personally identifiable information to this Site, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless specified otherwise at the point of collection on this Site. We may combine personally identifiable information with passively collected information.
We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties located in the United States and/or any other country, including: affiliates, sponsors, other golf related organizations, third parties we use to support our business (such as fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services and email service providers), or where required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations.
Security. We will take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our Site and to protect such information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. Be advised that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from this Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
Links to Other Web Sites. You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to your computer, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to the Site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.
Miscellaneous. Your use of this Site is subject to the Terms of Use. If you choose to use the Site, your visit and any dispute over privacy and data collection is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of Wisconsin.
Changes to This Privacy Policy. If this Privacy Policy changes, the revised policy will be posted on this Website. All revisions will be posted to this site, and will apply to all data collected by the WSGA before and after the revised policy’s effective date. Your continued use of the Site after these changes have been posted constitutes your binding acceptance of these Terms.
