3. Storing of and transfers of your personal data
Your Personal Data may be stored and transferred inside or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We only transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA where the EU Commission has decided that the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection in line with EU data protection standards or if there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. Where we transfer Personal Data to a third country, we may do so on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses which are a form of data processing contract approved by the European Commission. You can find a copy of these clauses here.
If you would like to find out more about the appropriate safeguards that we have in place to govern the transfer of your Personal Data you can contact us at dataprivacy@leinsterrugby.ie.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will always do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will endeavour to use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
4. Your rights and how to exercise them
This section sets out the rights which you have to address any concerns or queries with us about our processing of your Personal Data.
Note that in certain circumstances, these rights may not be absolute:
Right
Further Information
Right of Access
·        You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data held by us about you and to access the following information in relation to the processing of your Personal Data:
(1)   the  purposes of processing;
(2)   the categories of Personal Data concerned;
(3)   the recipients of your Personal Data;
(4)   the period for which your Personal Data will be stored;
(5)   the existence of your right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission; and
(6)   the source of your Personal Data.
·        We will only charge you for making an access request where we feel your request is unjustified or excessive.
Right to Rectification
·        You have the right to request that we amend any inaccurate Personal Data that we have about you.
Right to Erasure
·        You have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Data where:
(1)   it is no longer necessary to perform our contract with you;
(2)   you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis permitting us to process your Personal Data;
(3)   you object and we have no overriding legitimate interest;
(4)   your Personal Data has been unlawfully processed; or
(5)   it must be erased to comply with a legal obligation.
·        Please note that erasure may not be complete or immediate to the extent that some of your Personal Data is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
Right to Restriction of Processing
·        You have the right to ask us to restrict processing your Personal Data in the following situations:
(1)   where you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data;
(2)   where the processing is unlawful and you do not want us to delete your Personal Data;
(3)   where we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes of processing but you require the data in relation to a legal claim; or
(4)   where you have objected to us processing your Personal Data pending verification as to whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests or in connection with legal proceedings.
·        When you exercise this right we may only store your Personal Data and may not further process it unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.
Right to Data Portability
·        You may request us to provide you with your Personal Data which you have given us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you may request us to transmit your Personal Data directly to another data controller where this is technically feasible.
·        This right only arises where:
(1)   we process your Personal Data with your consent or where it is necessary to perform our contract with you; and
(2)   the processing is carried out by automated means.
Right to Object
·        You have a right to object at any time to our processing of your Personal Data where we process your Personal Data on the legal basis of pursuing our legitimate interests.
You can exercise any of these rights by submitting a request to our Data Protection Executive whose contact details are set out in section 5 of this Notice.
We will provide you with information on any action taken upon your request in relation to any of these rights without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receiving your request. We may extend this timeframe by one more month if necessary having regard to the circumstances of the request. However, we will inform you if this arises.
5. Questions and complaints
If you have any concerns about the way your Personal Data are being used or processed by Leinster Rugby, please contact our Data Protection Executive at dataprivacy@leinsterrugby.ie.
If you have any concern in relation to how your Personal Data is used or processed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection regulator. For further information and to find your national data protection regulator, please see here.
6. Changes to the notice
If we amend this notice, in whole or part, at our sole discretion, any changes will be effective immediately upon communicating the revised notice to you.
If at any time we decide to use your Personal Data in a manner significantly different from that stated in this notice, or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, we will notify you and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in the new manner.
