Also, if you submit personal information to the CSE Sites (such as your name, interests or preferences), we may use cookies to keep track of such information so that you will not need to re-enter this information during subsequent visits. We use cookies to customize the delivery of the CSE Sites' content and advertisements. We also use cookies so that we (or our third party advertising service providers) may, within our advertising network, serve you advertisements more relevant to your preferences based on your activities on the CSE Sites and other websites. We may also authorize our commercial partners (or their advertising service providers) to use cookies so that they may serve you advertisements relating to their products and services. You may limit the automatic collection of certain information by the CSE Sites, for instance by disabling the cookies using your browser options. Please be aware that by doing so it may prevent you from using specific features on the CSE Sites.We may also use tracking pixels using Google Tag Manager. We may share information about you from cookies, device identifiers, location data and usage data with entities that are CSE Parties or become part of the CSE Parties. Web servers serving the CSE Sites may automatically collect information about which pages you visit, as well as your IP address or domain name. We may use this information for our internal website business purposes, for example, to tailor content on CSE Sites or to assess the amount of traffic to the CSE Sites. We may also provide this information on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our marketing partners and/or advertisers.The CSE Sites contain links to third party sites. For instance, when purchasing tickets to our events, you may be sent to Ticketmaster® or another third party website. The CSE Parties are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites, and we recommend that you view the privacy policy posted on each site that you use to confirm that the website's policies are acceptable to you.If you sign into the CSE Sites using your NHL.com account, you should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the NHL.com Privacy Policy, which may be viewed at www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy.You may be given the option to access or register for the services offered by the CSE Parties through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your Facebook account, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us.
