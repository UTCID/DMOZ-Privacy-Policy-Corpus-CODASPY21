A formal policy has been put into place beginning this season, Summer 2019, for the movement of swimmers into new practice groups.  Please keep in mind, that each swimmer progresses at a different pace.  The long term goal is to keep your child happy and swimming throughout their high school career.
Summer Season:
Testing will take place during the last week of May at the discretion of the coaches.
The coaches will collectively decide 1.) your swimmer passed the required standards for the next group  2.) the move will be benefical for your swimmer based on the increased practice requirements.  Coaches will verbally notify the swimmer/parent (Sands/Tigers), Swimmer (Gully/Mako/Thresher) by the conclusion of the week.  An email confirmation will be sent to all parents notifying them of the move and any pertinent information related to the new level.  The swimmer's official move date to the new practice group will be the first day of outdoor practice.
