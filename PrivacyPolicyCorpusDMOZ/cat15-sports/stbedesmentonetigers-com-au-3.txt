All children who are a part of our club have a right to feel and be safe. The welfare of the children in our care will always be our priority and the club has a zero tolerance to child abuse. The club aims to create a child safe and child-friendly environment where children feel safe and have fun, and the club’s activities are always carried out in the best interests of the children.
To this end, the St Bedes/Mentone Tigers AFC has adopted a Child Safe Mission Statement in line with the South Metro Junior Football League to ensure the safety of all children. This mission statement is supported by the Club’s Child Safe Policy and Child Safe Code of Conduct.
