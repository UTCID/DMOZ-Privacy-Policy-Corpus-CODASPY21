Drone Policy
Out of safety concerns for guests, employees, and resort property, as well as concerns for individual privacy, Mount Kato prohibits the operation or use of unmanned aerial systems, or drones, by the general public – including recreational users and hobbyists – without the prior written authorization from the Resort.  This prohibition includes drones used for filming or videotaping, as well as any drone use by media or journalists operating above or within Mount Kato’s boundaries.  This prohibition on drone operations or use extends to any drones launched or operated from Resort property, as well as drones launched from private property outside of the Resort boundaries.  Please contact the resort if you have any questions or if you seek prior authorization to operate any aerial drones.  Any authorized operation of aerial drones may be governed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations and local law enforcement, as well as those policies separately established by Mount Kato, which may include certification, training, insurance coverage, indemnification requirements, and waivers or releases of liability.  Any violation of this policy may involve suspension of your skiing or snowboarding privileges, or the revocation of your season pass, as well as confiscation of any drone equipment, and may subject violators to any damages, including, but not limited to, damages for violations of privacy and/or physical or personal injuries or property damage, as well as regulatory fines and legal fees.
