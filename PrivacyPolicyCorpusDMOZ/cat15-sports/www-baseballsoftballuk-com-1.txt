Subject to all applicable Data Protection legislation, BaseballSoftballUK reserves the right to disclose any personal information about you or your use of the BaseballSoftballUK Website or BSUK Properties, including its contents, without your prior permission if BaseballSoftballUK has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of BaseballSoftballUK or its affiliated companies, (3) enforce these Terms of Use, or (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others.
