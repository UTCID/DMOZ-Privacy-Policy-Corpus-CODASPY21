Club Discipline: Cases
Weather | Rainout Policy
Given the crowded nature of our program schedules and the limited availability of fields, NTSC is unable to reschedule or replay any house league games which are cancelled or suspended due to weather or field conditions. Therefore, every effort will be made to proceed with scheduled games as long as it is safe to do so.
When weather or field conditions are an issue, games will sometimes be cancelled ahead of time at some or all fields. Such announcements will be posted on our home page, no later than 90 minutes ahead of the scheduled kickoff time.
In most cases, however, the decision to start (or not start) and continue (or not continue) a game will be made at the field. These decisions are the responsibility of the most senior referee present at the field, and such decisions are final.
In the event of thunder and/or lightning, NTSC adheres to Canada Soccer's Lightning Safety/Severe Weather Policy. In the event of thunder or lightning, games will be immediately halted. All parties are to quickly leave the field and seek shelter in a safe location. Players are not to return to the field - and the game will not be resumed - until 30 minutes after the last thunder or lightning. Referees have been advised to take a “better safe than sorry” approach concerning electrical storms and to always act with player safety in mind.
Games may also be cancelled in the event of unsuitable field conditions. NTSC maintains its programs  by obtaining permits for a variety of fields. The owners of these fields have differing policies on when fields may not be used, but generally, if there has been significant rainfall that leaves standing water on the field, creates unsafe conditions for players or increases the likelihood of significant damage to the field, games will not be played.
Such decisions, as with rainouts, will be made by the program supervisor or the most senior referee at the field.
As far as results and standings are concerned, any game that is cancelled before reaching half-time (or the halfway mark) will not be rescheduled (due to limited field availability), no result will be recorded and the game will be excluded from the standings. Any game that has reached or passed half-time (or the halfway mark) and is subsequently abandoned due to weather or field conditions, the official score shall be recorded as the score at the time the game was abandoned.
In the case of inclement weather or unsuitable field conditions during a playoff tournament, games may be delayed or rescheduled for later in the tournament. However, if this is not possible due to tight scheduling and limited field availability, any game that is suspended or abandoned without reaching half-time (or the halfway mark) will be recorded as a 1-0 win for the team with the higher ranking during the regular season. If a game that has reached half-time or the halfway mark has a tied score at the time the match is suspended, and rescheduling is not possible, the teams may proceed directly to a penalty shootout to determine the winner, at the discretion of the Club. If the shootout cannot be conducted, the team with the higher regular season ranking will be considered the winner.
