Privacy Policy
This privacy statement is applicable to LPGA.com and all its affiliates.
The LPGA's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.
The LPGA (hereafter referred
to as "LPGA" or "LPGA.com") does not collect personally identifiable
information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide
such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable
information may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, the
registration process for subscription sites or services and in connection with
content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and message boards), suggestions,
voting/polling activities and transactional areas.
Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold or
otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of
the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the user will
have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out"
of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products,
services and offerings from the LPGA and/or any third parties.
LPGA.com is sharing personally identifiable information with Google Analytics (acting
as its site traffic gathering agent for this limited purpose) for the sole purpose
of gathering statistical data on visitors to the site and the pages viewed by
those visitors. If you wish to opt out, visit Google Analytics' privacy center.
Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional information by the user,
the LPGA reserves the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status,
changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying
service and/or the information collected.
The LPGA may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason
to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact
or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference
with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the LPGA's rights or property,
other LPGA users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. The
LPGA may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law
requires it.
The LPGA reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior
and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas
of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number
of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.
The LPGA will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.
Also, users should be aware that the LPGA may sometimes permit third parties
to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through the LPGA's
site. The LPGA are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third
parties and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when
providing personally identifiable information.
Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally
identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards
or in the chat areas of the LPGA's sites, that information, along with any substantive
information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated
and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other
posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of the LPGA.
Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically
collected through the standard operation of the LPGA's internet servers or through
the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a web site can
use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use
of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data
that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not
programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies
work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the
assigning site. Users should be aware that the LPGA cannot or does not control
the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties
hosting data for the LPGA. If a user does not want information collected through
the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows
the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that
cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized
delivery of information) available on the LPGA's site.
Upon request, the LPGA will allow any user to "opt out" of further
promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, the LPGA will use
reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously
submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will
not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, the
LPGA will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user
and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible
to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups
and records of deletions.
The foregoing policies are effective as of February, 2004. The LPGA reserves
the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence
of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein
are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights
in or on behalf of any party.
By using this site, you signify your assent to the LPGA Privacy Policy. If
you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued
use of the LPGA's sites following the posting of changes to these terms will
mean you accept those changes.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web site's privacy statement, contact the LPGA.
