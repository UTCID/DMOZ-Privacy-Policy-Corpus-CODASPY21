Welcome to Forfar Amateur Swimming Club, which was established in 1887. It is a member of the Midland District of the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association. Our aim is to teach youngsters to swim, to teach the four main strokes plus diving and watermanship skills, and to coach swimmers to swim competitively. Competitive swimming requires great commitment. If you are a swimmer we hope that you will enjoy your swimming and progress well.
The club is an amateur club and requires help on Committee, with desk duties, at galas, with raffles etc. Poolside helpers are also required to help with teaching /coaching and timekeeping. Teachers/coaches are encouraged to work towards the ASA Level 1 and Level 2 teaching awards. Please offer your help.
