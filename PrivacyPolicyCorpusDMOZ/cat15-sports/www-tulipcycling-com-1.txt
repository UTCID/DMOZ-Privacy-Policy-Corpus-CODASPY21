The support given by Tulip Cycling was excellent.

Tissot family, USAA wonderful trip!!! Thanks to Peter for all his help to make it so special (and for convincing me to do the trip without a tour group). We had such a great time. My two 10 year old girls had such a great fun (and were proud of their accomplishment). It is a of a trip we will all remember. Thanks for everything! Ive already recommended you to friends. Sharon MooreJust returned from our fabulous journey from Amsterdam to Bruges. It was outstanding! The itinerary, the equipment (bikes, GPS, maps, etc.) and our guide Peter were fantastic. Peter really have deep knowledge of his country, what a memorable ride across the Netherlands. Brigitte and FrancoisThank you for everything. We packed lots of memories into this trip. It was a grand way to learn about Netherlands and see what a cultured and friendly place it is. The GPS was essential, and we are so glad we learned to use it. Everytime, we wondered where is Peter taking us? We would come across a canal, field of flowers, quaint village, spectacular scenery. Thank you so much. Susan and Billy HobartYou run a very professional organization and we look forward to more tours in the future. You have made us biking enthusiasts. Michael and Chau SmithI thought I would just let you know we are having such a GREAT TIME!! Maybe you can find a job for a orthodontist and a Radiologist for us.? Louise Taillard, South AfricaThank you so much for this very enjoyable experience! Your organizational skills and attention to detail are outstanding. Barbara MorganJust to thank you again for the wonderful trip, yours was the 7th we made and one of our favorites now Alicia FuentesMy wife and I just finished a 4 day self guided tour. It was fabulous! Tulip planned a route that we never could have found on our own. The equipment and handling of our luggage made everything easy. We loved the trip!! Bob BrownsonThank you Tulip Cycling for a exciting and scenic 5 day tour through part of your beautiful country. Peters meticulous organisation and first class equipment made our ride a memorable one. Geoff and Bethany Canberra AustraliaThe trip overall was our favorite vacation we've ever taken. We feel privileged to have visited. As a lifelong cyclist, it was like visiting the promised land. Katherine and Stephen Coleman, USAThank you for organizing our trip this summer, we had a fantastic time and will definitely return in the future. We had so many good experiences traveling along the countryside enjoying the scenery and weather. Auburn and Sean Brady, USAWe had a great time in Holland. Thank you for everything. Carvajal family, MexicoOur memories are still fresh in our minds and we loved every minute of out time in the Netherlands. Your company ensured the cycling portion was flawless and most enjoyable. Thank you for providing top quality bicycles and support equipment. John and Peg Lalonde, CanadaThe tour was wonderful, and I've recommended your services highly to my friends. In particular, the route selection was superb. Judith Macaluso, USAWe had the most wonderful holiday with your company and I wish to say a big thank you for all your hard work and professionalism in ensuring we had the best possible experience. Gillian and John Au, UKTulip Cycling just got better!
We do a weeks self guided tour with Tulip Cycling every year and have now been cycling for 9 years each time in a different area of this lovely country. John and Christine Widdowson, UKOur trip with you was fantastic....and we've told many others about it. The GPS made it unique. Martens family, USAWe have recommended your business to many people  as we had a terrific cycling trip, due to your professional organisation and fabulous path routing. The GPS was brilliant and the route really showcased the variety of experiences available in the Netherlands  there is no better way to see a country than through the eyes of a local.
Thank you, again. Richard LewisIt was truly an extraordinary journey, where everything was carefully prepared by you and your staff. We were enchanted by the landscapes of flower fields, windmills, canals, small towns and by the kindness with which we were treated by the Dutch people. It was really unforgettable days that make us want to return, and invite our friends as well. Emerson de CarvalhoTailor made tour for 3 days of cycling for my husband, me and teenage son! Fantastic bikes, superb organization!!! A fantastic get away and we just had to show up. Lots of opportunity to add in our own stops along the way, the route details, booked hotels and luggage transport made for a stress free journey. Peter is outstanding and lives what he does. Every detail taken care of do you can just get on the bike pedal away with your GPS route! ElspethWe did a six day ride in June to mark my 70th birthday. The accommodations were amazing; small, neat, clean hotels and bed and breakfasts. The GPS was a little iffy for us, but Peter always answered our call for a quick fix! I would love to come back and do another ride. Terry DickowYes, one can DIY a bike trip around the country, but we believe that the depth of knowledge that Tulip provided for our ride took us to and through places that we would not otherwise have experienced just following a map or Google Maps over 16 days. We believe Tulip provided very good value and we recommend them highly. Julie SoWe asked Peter to plan a ride on our tandem from Amsterdam to Ghent, Belgium in 8 days in September 2018. He planned the route, with beautiful maps and excellent GPS, arranged the hotels and the luggage transport. We even go to almost see the King in The Hague. Only thing he couldn't control was the weather, when a storm blew in from the North Sea. We got a bit wet and wind-blown, but thoroughly enjoyed all of his arrangements. Dolly CraftWe did the short version of the historic town. It was perfect for us as an American family of four with two teenage kids (13 and 16). If we ever get another chance, we would do it again and probably build in more days to the trip to just enjoy the different towns. Samantha PearsonMy husband and I did a 1-week tour through parts of the Netherlands in May 2018 and we loved our experience. Peter and Tulip Cycling were amazing! The level of detail and organization is spectacular! Communication with Peter is easy and quick. Our experience was so good that we are returning again next year with a large group! I highly recommend this tour company - you will be very pleased with the service! Natascha WeschWe were very happy with your cycling service. The e-bikes and GPS were an excellent choice for us as was your instruction at the outset. The Hanseatic tour was very interesting and the countryside beautiful. We particularly noticed how friendly and helpful the people in Holland are. We also noticed a more positive attitude about cyclists by motorists in Holland compared to motorists in Canada. Jim MaySkillfully selected routes, state of the art equipment, charming hotels. Our tour of the Netherlands was seamless. Thank you Tulip Cycling! Lori & Niamh, Alberta CanadaVery well chosen route, perfect logistics, good equipment. Thank you for a great vacation, Peter. We look forward to coming again. Alli Gil and Vladimir KontovorichPeter provided equipment, guidance, luggage transport and reservations for our 8 day trek from Amsterdam to Gent. It could not have been staged better. The GPS routing was spot on as it kept us on smaller, less traveled roads and brought us to comfortable hotels in each city/town center. As it turned out, I needed to take a day off from cycling because of an injury and Peter arranged for our luggage courier to pick up my bike as well.

As it turned out, I needed to take a day off from cycling because of an injury and Peter arranged for our luggage courier to pick up my bike as well. The bike moved to the next destination and after a days respite I was able to join my husband for the rest of the riding. We felt totally supported by Tulip and enjoyed the experience. We like to see the world slowly on our feet or on a bike. Tulip helped us make this possible.Renee and Michael MalakiJust returned from a fantastic 13-day tailor-made self-guided tour with Tulip Cycling. This was our first cycling trip and it exceeded expectations. The bicycles and accessories were perfect for the terrain, the maps and GPS made it impossible to get lost and guided us past great sights and surprises, and the hotels were centrally located and unique properties. Tanya and RichardTulip Cycling did a great job organizing a beautiful cycling trip for our family. We had three generations of cyclists from ages 9 to 75, and the trip was the perfect amount of cycling for all of us through villages, polders, farm fields, forests, country roads and over bridges and canals. The GPS system worked perfectly, the hotels you suggested were lovely, and every detail of the trip was considered and arranged.

The scenery was simply stunning, the cycleways user friendly and the people so friendly. This tour exceeded our expectations 10 fold.
I must point out that we experienced the most amazing weather. Out of character for Holland.
We cannot recommend this trip more highly. Our only criticism was no air con in the Hotels which everyone told is not usually needed.Donna SteurWe had a great time in Netherlands thanks to Tulip Cycling! Our trip was tailor-made to have short daily rides for our kids, which was highly appreciated. The GPS system was perfect, we never got lost. The hotels were nice. We recommend this very professional cycling travel agency. Aurore FabreNous avons adoré nos vacances à vélo. Lorganisation est impeccable, les trajets proposés sont magnifiques. Toute la famille (2 adultes et 2 ados de 13 et 16 ans) est unanime, on recommande vivement Tulip Cycling. Émile, Marie-Odile, Jean-Charles et Chantal (Québec, Canada)My husband, I and some friends did 3 times rides with Tulip Cycling, and so far is the best company I met. Peter is very careful.

Would book through Tulip Cycling again and again!Constance LeeMy daughter and I were fortunate enough to book a 4 day trip in May 2019. As we were in Almelo visiting family and wanted to head back to Amsterdam, Tulip Cycling arranged a tour up into Friesland and across the Ijsselmeer by ferry. It was fantastic.

I am excited to tell all my friends about my trip and this lovely country and encourage them to come and visit and use Tulip Cycling to see the country. Mary ThomasOur friends recommended this cycling trip for my 50th birthday and it was a fabulous celebration-- by far the best family vacation we have ever taken! The route Peter crafted for us was perfect-- so beautiful! The hotels were quaint, food was delicious. And our 11 and 12 year old loved riding tandem. I cried when we had to go home. Weve talked about this trip for months... can't wait to return. A 5-star experience! Jane and MarkTulip Cycling arranged a cycling trip in the provinces of Gelderland and Limburg for us. We spent a wonderful carefree week cycling. The navigation system provided with the itinerary was easy to operate, the overnight accommodations we stayed were conveniently located, and Tulip Cycling even arranged for luggage transportation upon our request. We can heartily recommend Tulip Cycling to anyone who plans a cycling holiday in the Netherlands. Mary and MarcWe had a great family cycling trip organised by Tulip Cycling ... in Germany ... not quite as planned due to coronavirus! Peter had helped us plan an itinerary from Cologne to Amsterdam, but then the UK put NL on the quarantine list 48 hours before we were due to set off.
