Coaches, Team Officials, Parents and Supporters
WINNING IS IMPORTANT BUT WE DO NOT WIN AT ALL COSTS
Concentrate on developing skill
Coach – don’t barrack
Don’t focus on the opposition’s dubious tactics;
Praise in public, criticise in private; don’t yell at the players;
Play within the rules; teach the players to play hard but play fair;
All players must get equal opportunity to play; irrespective of ability;
All players are to receive equal match time up to and including under 12’s;
Under13’s to under 15’s should play at least ½ a game;
Match time for Under 16 & Under17 is at the coach’s discretion;
Match times are subject to consistent attendance at games and training by players.
BE THE ROLE MODEL FOR YOUR TEAM
Stay calm, don’t abuse the umpire or dispute an umpire’s decision. Remember most umpires are young and are learning the game too;
Treat all players and parents with respect;
No swearing; bad language does not win games;
Treat club and opposition equipment and facilities as if they are your own;
Recognise players regardless of their individual ability;
Use the runner to deliver messages; avoiding yelling at players on the ground;
Avoid confrontation with opposing clubs’ officials and spectators at all costs;
Club jackets or polo shirts are to be worn when representing the club.
BUILD SELF ESTEEM IN YOUR TEAM
Teach players that racial, religious or colour vilification is unacceptable;
Provide positive feedback and constant encouragement to your team;
Teach the players that a champion team will always beat a team of champions;
Ensure that playing the game and training is fun for all;
Praise the team effort.
KNOW THE RULES OF THE COMPETITION
Coach the players to respect the umpire and the umpire’s decisions, all the time;
Teach the players the importance of modified rules;
Ensure that your team wears correct uniforms;
Wearing of mouthguards is compulsory;
If a report or any other incident concerning your team is brought to your attention, notify the club’s “Vice President Juniors” as soon as possible;
Coaches are ambassadors for our club; our objective is “Happy Players, Happy Parents”.
