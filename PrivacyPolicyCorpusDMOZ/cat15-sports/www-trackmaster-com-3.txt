Site Privacy Policy
Please Note: This privacy policy was last updated on April 3, 2012 and
is subject to future change without notice.
AXCIS Information Network, Inc. (d/b/a TrackMaster) has created this
privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for

By accepting this privacy statement, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information

we will post a notice on the above-referenced website and we may also choose to send an email to users who have provided an email address.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and

your download history and to gather broad demographic information. We monitor
access to the site via IP address for data scrapers and automated access of

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your account. We use cookies to
deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't
have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes.
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact
information (like their name and e-mail address) and basic demographic
information. We use customer contact information from the registration form to
send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information
is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of
receiving future mailings; see the Opt Out Procedures for Mailings section

data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that
we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to

basis.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information,
products, and services. We collect visitor's financial information (like their
account or credit card numbers). Financial information that is collected is
used to bill the user for products and services. Billing is processed on a
daily or weekly basis unless you have reached a preferred customer account
status, at which point your card will be billed at the end of the month for
purchases made during that month. Monthly account billing will continue until
the visitor notifies TrackMaster in writing or if the monthly billing process
fails, at which time billing for all future purchases will be processed daily
or weekly.
Site Security
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission
by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
input. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and
alteration of the information under our control. trackmaster.com uses 256-bit
encryption for all secure links, which adheres to federal and international
guidelines for secure server transactions. We transmit your credit card number
to the appropriate credit card company during order processing through an
encrypted connection.
