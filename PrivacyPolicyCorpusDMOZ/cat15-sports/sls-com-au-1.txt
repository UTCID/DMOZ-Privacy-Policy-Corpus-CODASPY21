Privacy Policy
The protection of personal information is important to Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA).  SLSA is committed to respecting the right to privacy and the protection of personal information.
This document sets out:
what personal and sensitive information SLSA collects
how SLSA collects personal and sensitive information
how SLSA uses or discloses personal and sensitive information
how individuals can access or seek correction of information held by SLSA and
who to contact regarding privacy issues and complaints.
By providing your personal information to SLSA, you consent to its use, storage and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This Policy provides for the way in which Surf Life Saving Australia Ltd, its affiliated State Centres, Branches and Clubs (SLSA Affiliates) may collect, use, store and disclose information.  Third party commercial entities and subsidiaries, whether owned or acting on behalf of SLSA or an affiliate or not, may be subject to the same privacy laws and may be governed by their own privacy policies.  SLSA will always do its utmost to ensure that personal information is respected and protected.
What personal and sensitive information does SLSA collect?
Personal Information
Generally, personal information is information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) from which it is possible to determine someone’s identity.
The information collected by a SLSA about a particular person will vary depending on the circumstances of collection.  It may include, but is not limited to, a person’s contact details (name, email and/or postal address, phone number), date of birth, gender, credit card details, driver licence number, passport number, insurance details, employment history, qualifications or communication history with SLSA.
Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is a type of personal information that also includes information or an opinion about:
racial or ethnic origin
political opinions
membership of a political association, professional or trade association or trade union
religious beliefs or affiliations or philosophical beliefs
sexual preferences or practices
criminal record; or
health, genetic information or disability.
If it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances, SLSA may also collect sensitive information such as a person’s medical history, nationality, their ethnic background or disabilities.
SLSA is required by law to obtain consent when collecting sensitive information.  SLSA will assume consent to the collection of all sensitive information that is provided to it for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless told otherwise.
How does SLSA collect personal and sensitive information?
Information may be collected when you:
become a member of a surf life saving club, association or other body which is a member or affiliated with SLSA
subscribe to any publication of SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate, including electronic publications
provide details to SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate in an application form, consent form, survey, feedback form or incident report
enter personal information into, or agree to having your personal information entered into, one of SLSA’s online systems such as ‘Surf Guard’ or another SLSA online system
access the SLSA website
contact SLSA via email, telephone or mail or engage with SLSA via social media
participate in any program, activity, competition or event run by SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate
purchase tickets to a surf life saving or sporting event from SLSA or an authorised agent
purchase merchandise, products or services from SLSA or an authorised agent or licensee
are elected or appointed to the Board or a committee of SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate
apply for employment or a volunteer position with SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate or
where SLSA is required to do so by law (for education, VET training, child protection, Work health and safety laws, AVETMISS, charitable collections, Good Samaritan, Medical Treatment  or other legislation in Australia).
Providing information
Depending on the circumstances, some types of information will be required and others might be optional. If you do not provide some or all of the information requested, this may affect SLSA’s ability to communicate with you or provide the requested products or services.
By not providing requested information, you may jeopardise your ability to participate in programs or competitions or apply for employment or volunteer positions with SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate.  If it is impracticable for SLSA to deal with you as a result of you not providing the requested information or consents, SLSA may refuse to do so.
Collection from third parties
SLSA or an SLSA Affiliate may collect personal information regarding a child from the parent or other responsible person associated with that child.
In some circumstances, SLSA collects information from SLSA Affiliates or other third parties.
Examples of such third parties could include, without limitation, the Australian Institute of Sport, the Australian Olympic Committee, non-affiliated surf life saving organisations or government and law enforcement bodies.
Information storage and protection
SLSA stores information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. Much of the information we collect from and about our members is added to our ‘Surfguard’ database which is hosted by a third party data storage provider. When your information is entered into the Surfguard database, the information may be combined or linked with other information held about you.
Security of personal information is important to SLSA.  SLSA has taken steps to protect the information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the security measures SLSA uses includes strict confidentiality requirements of our employees, volunteers, SLSA Affiliates and service providers, as well as security measures for system access, and security measures for our website such as firewalls and system encryption.
SLSA is required to comply with the Federal Government Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme (NDBS). When SLSA has had a data breach that could result in serious harm, SLSA will notify the individual(s) that is/are affected. SLSA when notifying the individuals(s) and Australian Information Commissioner, will also outline what steps will be undertaken in response to the breach. A review of the breach will be undertaken, and action(s) implemented to prevent a future breach.
How does SLSA use and disclose personal and sensitive information?

In some circumstances, personal information may also be disclosed outside of Australia. In such circumstances, SLSA will use its best endeavours to ensure such parties are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are suitably similar to the Australian Privacy Principles.
Any disclosure will be on such terms and conditions as SLSA determines taking into account the circumstances of the disclosure but always with the best interests of the parties whose personal information is being disclosed.

In addition, we may use “cookies” on the SLSA website. Cookies are small text files that help a website to remember the preferences of users to improve the experience of using that website.

Accessing and seeking correction of information held by SLSA
SLSA will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on the accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly and indirectly.
SLSA also relies on Affiliates and volunteers to enter data and make their best endeavours to ensure data is accurately recorded.
We encourage all users to regularly review and update their personal information on the Surfguard database and via the “members portal” link.
Individuals may also request access to their personal information held by us by making a request via the contact details set out below.
