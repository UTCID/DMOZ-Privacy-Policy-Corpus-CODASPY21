RISING YOUNG STAR AND ACCOMPLISHED GOLF COURSE ARCHITECT ANDREW H. GREEN
When Anne Arundel County purchased Eisenhower in 2017 the plan was to create an environmentally friendly, first class facility enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels. After interviewing many accomplished architects, Andrew Green, president and principal at A.H. Green Design/Green Golf & Turf, was tasked to bring our vision to life. Green was recognized by Golf Digest in November of 2018 as the #3 Renovation Expert currently working and has done work at prestigious clubs including; Congressional’s Blue Course, Inverness Club, East Course at Oak Hill and the historic Scioto Country Club where Jack Nicklaus grew up playing.

LEARN ABOUT OUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS
Andrew Green worked closely with Anne Arundel County’s Watershed Protection and Restoration Program and Department of Public Works throughout the renovation. The result of this partnership has increased the property's wetlands by over 13 acres. The steam restoration, boardwalks and wetland grass areas will assist in keeping the Chesapeake Bay watershed healthy and improve drainage throughout the facility while being visibly appealing for the golfers.
