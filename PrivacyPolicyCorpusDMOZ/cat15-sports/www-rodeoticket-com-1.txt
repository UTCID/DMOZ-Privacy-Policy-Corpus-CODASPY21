2. DESCRIPTION OF RACE REGISTRATION ONLINE (DBA RODEO TICKET)
RODEO TICKET provides an effective, yet simple means for Organizers and planners of events (“Organizers”)
to collect event registration fees from registered users who wish to attend such events (“Buyers”). After visiting the
Site to fill out information about their events including pricing, location, products, charities, etc., Organizers may
set up collecting event registration fees online directly from Buyers. Payments are transacted through the RODEO TICKET payment processing gateway (the "Gateway"). For more information, please see https://www.RodeoTicket.com.
These Terms and Conditions apply to both Organizers and Buyers alike.
3. PAYMENT METHODS
Depending on the payment processing option the Organizer elects when using the Service, monetary payments will
be made to the Organizer by RODEO TICKET. There is one form of payment processing for Organizers which
requires the use of the Gateway for event registration fee collection.
(a) Payment Process
If an Organizer elects to use the Service to collect event registration fees, payment processing is directly handled
by RODEO TICKET. Under the Service, (i) RODEO TICKET will collect all event registration fees on behalf
of the Organizer from the Buyer and deduct all applicable service charges from the event registration fees passed
along to the Organizer.; (ii) RODEO TICKET will distribute all payments to the Organizer (event registration fees minus
applicable service charges) at the address, or direct deposit details that the Organizer accurately provides on the Site;
and (iii) RODEO TICKET will submit payment for the balance due to the Organizer within fifteen (15) business days after
the event end date for the event to which the registration fees correspond, provided that RODEO TICKET reserves the right
to withhold funds at any time as RODEO TICKET determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all returns,
disputed charges, customer complaints, allegations of fraud and other discrepancies. Payments will not be distributed
until a minimum of $100 has been processed through the RODEO TICKET software, unless the payment is the final distribution
for the year. All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars, or other foreign currencies accepted by RODEO TICKET.
For all sales, fees, charges, and funds paid in foreign currency, RODEO TICKET will collect and disperse the funds in the foreign currency used.
(b) Refunds
(i) The Organizer has the responsibility to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds on the behalf
of Buyers via the Service. Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this Agreement
and the payment and refund mechanics of the Service. Refunds issued by Organizer will be processed within thirty
(30) days after Organizer instructs the issuance of the refunds via the Service. No payments shall be made to an
Organizer from RODEO TICKET with respect to any event that is cancelled. If a Buyer desires to request a refund,
Buyer must request the refund from the Organizer (either before the event or shortly after the event, to permit the
Organizer sufficient time to issue the refund). All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the
Organizer and Buyer and RODEO TICKET will not be responsible or liable for refunds or the lack thereof issued in
the course of the use of the Full Service option.
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whether you are using the Service
as an Organizer, Buyer or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that RODEO TICKET shall have the right to
force a refund of any or all funds at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if RODEO TICKET
receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by RODEO TICKET in its sole discretion) of
Buyers with respect to an Organizer or the applicable event, or RODEO TICKET determines in its sole discretion
that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations.
(c) Credit Card Chargebacks
RODEO TICKET will be the sole and direct channel of correspondence in all chargeback proceedings.
Chargeback notifications from use of the Service (initiated by the Buyer with their credit card provider) are sent
directly to RODEO TICKET via the constituent merchant banks. RODEO TICKET will utilize all available
resources to contest or address each chargeback directly with the merchant bank in the time allotted for response.
Chargeback cases where RODEO TICKET does not successfully secure a reversal or deems the chargeback to
be warranted as stated, shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event. RODEO TICKET shall either (i)
deduct these costs, and any associated fees from the merchant bank, from such Organizer’s outstanding balance,
whether for that particular event or for any other event that such Organizer lists through the Service; or (ii) send an
invoice to such Organizer for such costs if no balance exists. If payment for such invoice is not received by RODEO TICKET within thirty (30) days, RODEO TICKET reserves the right, at RODEO TICKET’s sole discretion,
to terminate such Organizer’s registration for the Service and to cancel all other events listed by such Organizer
as provided herein. In accordance with and without limiting Section 11, all communications and disputes regarding
chargebacks are between the Organizer and Buyer and RODEO TICKET will not be responsible or liable in any
way for chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the Full Service option.
(d) Confirmation
RODEO TICKET generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number upon receipt
of a credit card authorization from each purchase. If you are using the Service as an Organizer, you agree to
unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all registration commitments that have been confirmed by RODEO TICKET
through the Service, and it is your responsibility to verify the Buyer’s status, confirmation number and/or any event
restrictions prior to the subject event.
