Hornets Sports and Entertainment (the “Hornets”) appreciate your enthusiasm and the time and energy you spend supporting our team.
The Hornets company policy, however, does not allow us to accept or consider any unsolicited ideas, suggestions, proposals, comments or materials (“Submissions”).
The purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings when the Hornets branding, logos, promotions, marketing campaigns, product enhancements, or creative artwork might appear to be similar or identical to ideas submitted to the Hornets.
TERMS OF IDEA SUBMISSIONS
Despite knowing our policy, if you still choose to submit your ideas to the Hornets, then regardless of what your letter says, the following terms shall apply to your Submissions.
You agree that:
The Hornets will consider the Submissions to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.
The Hornets shall have no obligations concerning the Submissions, including but not limited to, no obligation to return any materials or acknowledge receipt of any Submissions.
The Hornets may use, redistribute, or disclose the Submissions for any purpose and in any way, without any compensation for you or any third party.
