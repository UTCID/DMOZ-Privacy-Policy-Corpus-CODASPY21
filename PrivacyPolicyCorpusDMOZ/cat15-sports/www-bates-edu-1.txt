Non-Employee Background Check Registration
Campus Life believes in creating and sustaining safe environments for our students to thrive. Individuals that work on a consistent basis (i.e., more than once) with a student organization or club advised by Campus Life, but are not otherwise affiliated with the Bates community (e.g., a student or employee of the college) are required to complete a background check. Please complete the form below to register. You will be contacted soon to complete the background check process.
Bates College works with Hire Image to complete background checks. You may review their consumer privacy policy here.
