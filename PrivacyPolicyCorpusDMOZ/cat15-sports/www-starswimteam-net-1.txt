Communication Policy
Coach-Swimmer Communication:
Feedback is given to the athletes daily: as a group and as individuals.
*0nce a swimmer understands the expectations that are given, we expect them to act upon that knowledge they have received.
*We cannot make a swimmer do anything.
Basic skills are taught the same throughout the STAR program.
*Additional skills are taught as swimmers master the basics and progress throughout the program.
Swim Meets are where athletes get saturated with feedback.
*In the early season, swimmers are taught race strategies before an event and given feedback after the event.
*By the end of the season, swimmers are prepared to swim the race strategy that best fits their goals and abilities.
As role models for the STAR athletes, we have to deal with swimmers differently depending on their needs and personality. Some people need more attention than others. We talk with many athletes about subjects outside of swimming, other athletes just want to be on STAR to swim and then go home. We adjust to the needs of the individuals. As a coaching staff we encourage swimmers to ask questions before, during, or after workouts.
Coach-Parent Communication:
*The Head Coaches encourage parents to call during office hours with questions they may have. Office hours MWF 9-12 noon - 651-704-0024
(Night calls will not be returned until the next office hours. This is our home phone)
*Workout is not the time to talk to the coaches. It is not fair to the swimmers. Before or after workout is OK, except when swimmers are in need of attention.
*Newsletters, although written, may not always be read.
*Life Line Book and the Web Site. More information than anyone could ask for.
*At registration we will have coaches present for questions and answers.
Watching Your Child At Swim Practice
A paragraph from an article in News For SWIM PARENTS offers some good advice. "What's wrong with encouraging your child during practice? There are two issues. First we want the child to focus on the coach and to learn the skill for their personal satisfaction rather than learning it to please their parents. Secondly, parental encouragement often gets translated into a command to swim faster and swimming faster may be the exact opposite of what the coach istrying to accomplish. In most stroke skill development we first slow the swimmers down so that they can think through the stroke motions. Save encouragements and praise for after the practice session! This is the time when you have your child's full attention to tell them how proud you are of them".
