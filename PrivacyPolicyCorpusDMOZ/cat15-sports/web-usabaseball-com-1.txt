This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth below in this Section 9.B, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and equitable relief available in the courts of the State of New York, provided that:	 The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages; and Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party.

In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section 9, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under Section 9.C other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive the right to bring any Claim in any forum unless you provide USA Baseball with written notice of the event or facts giving rise to the Claim within one (1) year of their occurrence.10.
