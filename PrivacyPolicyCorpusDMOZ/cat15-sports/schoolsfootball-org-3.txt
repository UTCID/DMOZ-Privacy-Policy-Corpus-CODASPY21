National Schools’ Competition Entrants
Please read this privacy notice carefully to see how the English Schools’ Football Association will treat the personal information that you provide.
This information is collected so that we can effectively and efficiently organise our activities for our members and so is sought under the “legitimate interests” basis outlined in the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) legislation.
Your Data
Why we need it, what we use it for and when we no longer need it
In order to ensure that the Association’s football calendar of activity is delivered, your contact details (including your name, postal address, telephone number, email address) are held in the Association’s digital records and are published in the Association Handbook.
Handbooks
Handbooks are made available to all affiliated members, to competition entrants and to sponsors who provide funding for our activity (eg PlayStation). Details will be retained on our database, which is password protected and hosted on the FA’s server which is subject to FA data security controls.
Data Use
Your information will be used for the purpose of communicating essential information relating to the planning, organising, delivering, administering, celebrating and governing schools’ football and will be made available only to those who need it for this purpose. Your contact information may be shared with partners who provide discounted services, products or opportunities specifically designed for the ESFA and its customers in the interests of providing schools’ football (eg, PlayStation).
Player Information
Player names and dates of birth shall be collected for teams entering national competitions. Names may be used for team sheets and programmes or other publicity measures (subject to appropriate consents), and will be shared with match officials. Subject to appropriate consent, player photographs may also be taken and used for publicity purposes.
Player names from teams reaching the national finals will be retained for the archive. Dates of birth shall be collected to check player eligibility.
We will use the personal details you provide about your players in the event that discipline cases are referred to the ESFA, and those records will be retained for the periods laid down by FA regulations.
Records are held in password protected, network enabled PCs on the FA’s network, which is subject to FA data security controls.
Your Financial Details
We will collect and retain your bank details for the purposes of necessary financial transactions (eg, should a refund become due), and will ensure that our e-security arrangements minimise risks to that information.
Details of any financial transactions shall be retained for the duration specified by the regulatory framework governing those transactions (eg HM Treasury guidance)
Third Parties
Your personal information will not be shared with others unless the Association is legally obliged to do so under English law for statutory, legislative or regulatory purposes.
Archive
At the end of each playing season, your data will be retained as part of the Association’s archive. You will also be invited to update your information for the following season. Should any of your details change at any point, or should you wish for your details to be removed, please contact the Data Controllers, using the contact details below and the records will be amended accordingly without delay.
Withdraw Consent
You can withdraw your consent for all or any of these data uses at any time after you have given consent, by outlining your preferences in writing.

Giving Consent
Without your agreement to the use of your information as described here, the ESFA will be unable to contact you with information relating to fixtures, football regulations, Council decisions, AGM matters and other essential business requirements.
We will also be unable to provide your details to other member colleagues with whom you regularly correspond.
We can no longer assume that you are happy for us to contact you – the law requires you to actively state that this is the case.
The Data Protection Statement in the portal will be the means by which you complete this: be aware that a failure to opt in will result in your contact details, and therefore our ability to communicate with you, removed.
