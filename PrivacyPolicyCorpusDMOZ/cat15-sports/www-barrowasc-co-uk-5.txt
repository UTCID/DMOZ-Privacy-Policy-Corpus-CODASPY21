Swimmer Session Policy
For the safeguarding of your child, in the event of your child needing to leave a session early, we require you to speak to your childâ€™s coach at the beginning of the session or send them with a signed note explaining the reason for leaving early and stating the time they are to leave. We will not allow any swimmer to leave early without prior notice. Notice to be given for every individual session.
