2050 aims to see Hawthorn’s premiership tally rise to a total of 20 premierships by 2050, two of which the club aims to achievein the next five years.
The 33-year vision will guide the club to deliver long term objectives of continual growth, innovation and on-field success.
The club’s grand vision is formed by a series of five-year strategic plans; HFC1 2018 to 2022, HFC2 2023 to 2027, HFC3 2028 to 2032, and so on.
The first five year strategic plan titled ‘Dare to be Different’ will drive the club’s priorities and decision making through to 2022.
There are several strategic priorities outlined within ‘Dare to be Different’ including winning two premierships, achieving 100,000 members, developing a new training and administration facility at Dingley, securing an AFLW license and extending the club’s Tasmanian Government partnership.
President Jeff Kennett said the plan set some ambitious goals however none that couldn’t be achieved if the club continued to set high standards, strive for innovation and aim to be a step ahead of the game.
“At Hawthorn we aren’t ones to sit back and wait, we work hard to achieve and deliver exciting results, on and off the field,” Kennett said.
“Our vision for our strategic plan, “Dare to be Different”, encapsulates this as we continue to strive for excellence.
“We have set ourselves some ambitious targets but all are within our grasp if we continue to innovate, grow and forge new frontiers within the AFL industry.”
