Sit, Stay, & Play at Samoset Resort
Samoset Resort in Rockport is delighted to welcome furry canine companions who are 30 pounds and under. Guests bringing their dog will be charged a non-refundable fee of $75 per night, per dog. Upon arrival at the resort, we will set your furry friend up with a gift bag outfitted with waste bags and dental stick treats at no additional charge to ensure Fido has everything he needs for a chic stay!
Since you get to enjoy gourmet meals at our restaurants and the sweetest of dreams in our plush beds, we thought why can’t Fido enjoy the same?! Guests bringing canine companions will also be outfitted with a plush Opal Paws dog mat and food and water bowls to ensure your dog’s vacation is as great as yours. You may take these items home with you, but please note an additional $30 fee will be added to your bill upon departure.
Things to note during your stay:
Pet-friendly rooms: The dog-friendly rooms in our hotel are restricted to the ground-level rooms only. Our higher floors and our timeshare units do not allow dogs.
Pet-friendly areas: We have plenty of room for your furry best friend to explore: Hallways & lobby. Please stop by the front desk to grab a map of our dog-friendly walking area.
Pet in-room sign: To ensure we don’t disrupt your pup’s relaxation time, please place the “Pet In-Room” sign on the outside of your door whenever your pet is in your room
Housekeeping: For the safety and comfort of your pet and our staff, housekeeping service should be pre-arranged at a time the pet will not be in the room. Housekeeping will only enter your room if a) your dog is not present or b) you’re present and your dog is leashed or caged
We hope you and your four-legged friend have a bark-tastic stay with us at our dog-friendly hotel in midcoast Maine. Should you need any recommendations on groomers, vet services, parks, or pet-friendly restaurants, our team has you covered!
