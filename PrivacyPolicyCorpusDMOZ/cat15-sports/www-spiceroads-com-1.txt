About Our Tours
Travel Advice
At SpiceRoads, we’re committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy explains when and why we collect personal information about people who visit this website, www.spiceroads.com, how we use it, and how we keep it secure.
What type of information is collected and how is it used?
SpiceRoads might collect personal information from visitors and customers under the following circumstances:
Sending a Tour Enquiry
If you contact SpiceRoads with questions about our tours or other services, we will collect your name, email address, and your message in order to respond to your request.
Downloading a Tour Factsheet
If you download a tour Factsheet or send a tour enquiry, we will use email to communicate with you with the address you provide. Your email address may be stored in our system so we can follow up on your enquiries.
Subscribing to our Mailing List
If you subscribe to the SpiceRoads newsletter, we will send you information about SpiceRoads tours and products, company news and events, and special offers about twice per month, though occasionally it may be more than that. If you have been on a SpiceRoads tour and have not subscribed to our newsletter, we might contact you if we have an upcoming tour or departure that we think might interest you.
If you don’t want to receive newsletters, you can click on the link labelled “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email newsletter you receive from us.
Booking a Tour
If you book a SpiceRoads tour, we use forms to collect contact data you provide so that we can arrange your cycle tour and provide support. We will only use this information when it’s important to contact you as we prepare for your tour departure. This information is stored in our database and can be accessed by SpiceRoads office staff in order to assist you with booking or payment if necessary.
To book a tour, you will need to create a SpiceRoads account. This requires your name and email address. This account will also be used to update a booking or pay for a tour.
When booking a tour, SpiceRoads will collect your contact information including, your name, email address, and date of birth. Additionally, you may provide us with your mailing address, telephone number, and fax number. Because a cycling tour is an adventure experience service, we will also need to collect a name and number for an emergency contact individual to contact in the event of an emergency while on tour.
As a licensed tour operator, SpiceRoads is required to have your passport number and expiration date in many of the countries in which we operate. This information is also required in order to book and provide international travel services that are a part of your tour, such as accommodation and transportation, or to assist with visa and air ticket bookings.
Closer to your departure time, we will also collect information essential to providing our tour services to you, such as any medical conditions you might have that our tour leaders need to be aware of, any dietary requirements that might need special attention, your travel insurance provider and policy number, and your arrival and departing flight numbers and times. Most importantly, we will collect your height details in order to provide you with the correct size bike, should you choose to hire one of ours.
Receiving Post-Tour Surveys
After each tour we will send you a feedback survey to complete. These surveys are used as a way to monitor and improve our services. We value all or any feedback you are happy to provide. Participation in these surveys is completely optional and you have the choice whether or not to disclose this information.
