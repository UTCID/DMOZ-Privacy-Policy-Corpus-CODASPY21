Personalisation Terms and Conditions
Personalisation Terms and Conditions
All personalisation orders are subject to a £4.95 delivery charge
Harry Hall will not personalise any garments with offensive or inappropriate wording. Any orders with such language submitted, will not be processed and the customer will receive a refund.
Personalised items will scurry to our embroiders before arriving on your doorstep, so please expect an extended lead time of 10 to 14 working days for delivery of your personalised products
Unfortunately, next day delivery is not available on personalised items, due to the extended lead time of 10 to 14 working days
If your order contains personalised and non-personalised items, they will be shipped and delivered separately so please do not panic if your whole order does not arrive at once
Personalised orders include any goods specifically personalised to your specifications. Orders for personalised goods cannot be cancelled or changed once work has started on them
All of our personalised good are made to order, because they are bespoke to you we cannot accept returns on these items unless there is a manufacturing fault. We reserve the right to charge for re-posting of personalised orders returned in error
We cannot be held responsible for “whoopsies” on your personalised items. Make sure you check your item carefully before placing the order. This includes spelling, typographical or grammatical errors; poor image quality derived from low-resolution images, order quantity or other ordering errors
Faulty goods will be rectified free of charge. Any queries with personalised orders must be reported to us within 7 days of receipt. Please contact customer services on 01274 711 011 or email contact@harryhall.com and we will happily discuss the next steps and advise on how to return the goods
As horse riders we know you’re not afraid of some rain but please note our personalised items are carefully embroidered, meaning waterproof properties can no longer be guaranteed
Colours can vary by monitor and device, we are not responsible for any discrepancies between the colour on your screen and the colour of thread used. To find out more about the Madeira thread colours on offer please contact us on 01274 711 011 or contact@harryhall.com.
FAQs
I am a One Club Gold member do I pay delivery on my personalised items?
Yes, due to the process of personalisation, all orders are subject to a £4.95 delivery charge.
If I spend over £50 do I have to pay for delivery?
Yes, all orders for personalisation are subject to a £4.95 delivery charge.
How can I see a preview of my personalised items?
You will see a swatch example of your personalisation on the fabric via the product page. Unfortunately, we are unable to show you a preview of your full garment with personalisation on. Please refer to the product images to get an idea of what your personalised item will look like.
How long will it take to personalise my products?
It will take 10 days for your product to be personalised and delivered. Please note, if you have ordered other items at the same time these will be shipped separately from personalised products.
How much does personalisation cost?
This depends which areas you wish to personalise. Within each product the cost of personalisation is shown, for clothing you can choose to have the chest or back embroidered, and for horse products you can choose to embroider the left side, right side or both – the choice is yours!
How many characters can I add as personalisation?
This depends entirely on the product you want to personalise. On each product page the maximum number of characters is indicated and as you start typing this will countdown. Once you have reached the maximum number you will not be able to type anymore. If you have a longer name which exceeds the character limit we would recommend splitting it over more than one line.
What happens after my order is placed?
We’ll cleverly whizz your personalisation order to our embroiderers who are based near to us in Yorkshire and they’ll ensure your order is completed and shipped to reach you within 10 - 14 working days of your order being placed. You can sit back, relax and wait for your personalised goods to arrive.
Can I track my personalised order?
It will take around 10 days working days for your product to be personalised and delivered if you haven’t received your item within this time frame please contact us.
Please note, if you have ordered other items at the same time these will be shipped separately from personalised products.
Can I buy normal products at the same time as my personalisation products?
Yes absolutely! You can buy fly spray for your horse at the same time as personalising a yard blouson, please note they will arrive separately and at different times, we hope this is OK and just give our customer services team a call if you want to know anything else – 01274 711 011.
I want to order in bulk for my riding team, is this possible?
Of course, please contact our friendly team on 01274 711 011.
Can I return a personalised item?
As the item has been made especially for you unfortunately returns are not available on your personalised item. We’re pretty sure you’ll be chuffed with your item but if it happens to be faulty or you’re not happy drop us a line and we’ll help you out 01274 711 011.
