Expense and Reimbursement Policy
Maccabi Canada has adopted an official reimbursement policy for expenses incurred by directors, members, volunteers, staff, and athletes acting on behalf of Maccabi Canada.
Part I. General Guidelines
These general guidelines apply to non-fundraising events, community outreach programs, and travel.
Maccabi Canada expects directors, members, volunteers, staff, and athletes to act responsibly* when incurring and submitting expenses. Maccabi Canada will only reimburse pre-approved transactions such as:
Travel tickets and accommodations
Meals and tips (up to 15 percent)
Purchases made on behalf of Maccabi Canada
All expenses are subject to approval by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Proof of Purchase
A proof of purchase is required for reimbursement.  The following are acceptable forms of proof of purchase:
Detailed merchant receipts,
Credit card printouts, and
Email confirmation of travel tickets and/or accommodations.
Application for reimbursement must include the following:
Name and title of the applicant
Name and title of the Maccabi Canada officer who approved the expense
Nature of the expense
Purpose of the expense
Proof of purchase
All reimbursement applications must be submitted to the Maccabi Canada head office within 30 days of transaction.
Please note:
Maccabi Canada does not reimburse for local travel, fuel, maintenance, and traffic or parking violations.
Part II. Congress (previously known as Plenum)
Attending the Maccabi World Union Congress meetings is voluntary. Maccabi Canada does not cover travel, accommodation, and other expenses incurred by the directors, members, and volunteers to attend the Congress. It is at Maccabi Canada’s leadership discretion whether to cover ground expenses (basic room only, double occupancy shared with a Maccabi Canada representative) based on their contribution to the organization and Maccabi’s financial situation that year:
Year one post Games: President, Past Head of Delegation
Year two post Games: President
Year three post Games: President, Vice President, New Head of Delegation, if appointed.
Year of the Games: President, Vice President, Head of Delegation, Head of Logistics, Head of Juniors.
In the event that Maccabi Canada’s finances do not allow, the above options will not be available.
People listed above are encouraged to donate their cost of their ground fees to the organization.
Maccabi Canada leadership reserves the right to pay ground cost for additional people.
Travel arrangements for the Congress meetings are to be made independently and paid by those who choose to attend. Upon approval, if travel arrangements are made by Maccabi Canada’s head office, Maccabi Canada may ask directors, members, and volunteers to provide valid credit card information.  Directors, members, and volunteers are obliged to repay Maccabi Canada within 30 days of the end of the trip. If repayment is not made within the designated time limit, charges will be applied to the credit card on file.
Reimbursement and exchange of cheques
Directors, members, and volunteers can be reimbursed for their Congress expenses in exchange for an equivalent donation, voluntarily made to Maccabi Canada. Please inform Maccabi Canada’s head office that a donation has been made.  An official tax receipt will be issued for the donation amount.
The application for reimbursement must be received at Maccabi Canada head office within 30 days of the end of the trip and must include the following:
Name and title of the applicant
Name and title of the Maccabi Canada officer who approved the expense
Nature of the expense
Purpose of the expense
Proof  of purchase
A donation cheque with an equivalent amount**
Submitted expenses are subject to approval by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Part III. Regular and Annual General Meetings (AGMs)
Maccabi Canada may or may not cover travel expenses incurred to attend AGMs or any other meetings.
Directors, members, and volunteers will be reimbursed only if the expense was preapproved by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Part IV. Non-Fundraising Events and Programs
Maccabi Canada will reimburse directors, members, volunteers, staff, and athletes for preapproved expenses incurred on behalf of Maccabi Canada. Application for reimbursement must be received at Maccabi Canada head office within 30 days of transaction.
Applications for reimbursement must include the following:
Applicant’s full name, mailing address, email address, and phone number
Event name and date
Nature of the expense
Purpose the expense
Proof of purchase
Name of Maccabi Canada officer who approved the expense
Note: All expenses are subject to approval by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Part V. The Games
Athletes, staff, or volunteers will not be reimbursed for expenses that were not preapproved by Maccabi Canada.
Athletes, staff, or volunteers may not place orders invoiced to Maccabi Canada without a written approval by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Team managers, coaches, athletes, and any other designated persons must obtain a written approval by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada before incurring any expenses. Failure to obtain approval will result in the person making the purchase assuming that expense personally.
Preapproved expenses can be paid by one of the following options:
An invoice issued to Maccabi Canada directly by the vendor or
Pay the vendor and get reimbursed by Maccabi Canada with a valid proof of purchase, following the reimbursement application process outlined in Part I of this document under “General Guidelines”.
Note: All invoices and/or receipts must be made to Maccabi Canada only. Any other names may be shown on the invoice/receipt as a contact person. For both options all expenses must be pre-approved by an authorized officer of Maccabi Canada.
Expenses during the Games
Eligible staff members receive spending money in destination’s local currency.  This spending money is to be used in case of an emergency, or to be spent on your team/athletes as relevant to your role, if necessary.  At the conclusion of the trip, staff will be asked to return the same value of money in cash and/or receipts.
Additional expenses incurred during the games are subject to the Games refund policy as outlined in this document.
*fly coach class with the lowest available airfare for non-stop travel, rent mid-sized or compact vehicles, ask for discounted room rates at the time of room booking, and eat at the hotel if meals are included in the accommodation price.
**a cheque with matching donation amount enclosed to the application will significantly speed up the process
