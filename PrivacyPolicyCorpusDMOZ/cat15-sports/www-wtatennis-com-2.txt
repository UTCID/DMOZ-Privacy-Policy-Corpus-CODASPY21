Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and we nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect.
Binding Individual Arbitration
Purpose. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us or any of our affiliates regarding the WTA Sites or any service thereon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including but not limited to fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration Section (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with us or any affiliate of ours or any of our or their officers, directors, employees, contractors, or agents that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the Notice of Dispute clause below, other than those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause, you and the entity with which you have a Dispute agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Binding Individual Arbitration Section and not to litigate any Dispute in court. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in court by a judge or jury.
Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND US AND OUR AFFILIATES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY US OR OUR AFFILIATE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.
Right to Opt Out of Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Within 30 Days. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO WTA Tour, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 100 2nd Avenue S., Suite 1100-S, St. Petersburg, FL 33701 USA, AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US OR OUR AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION.
Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH US OR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO WTA TOUR, INC., ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT, 100 2ND AVENUE S., SUITE 1100-S, ST. PETERSBURG, FL 33701 USA TO GIVE US OR OUR AFFILIATE WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If we or our affiliate with which you have a Dispute does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you, us, or our affiliate with which you have a Dispute may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Binding Individual Arbitration Section.
Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or the entity with which you have a Dispute elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.
Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by the entity with which you have a Dispute concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal or state law also may apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with the entity with which you had a Dispute as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the entity with which you have a Dispute or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Location of Arbitration. You or the entity with which you have a Dispute may initiate arbitration in either New York County, New York or the county in which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your residence, the entity with which you have a Dispute may transfer the arbitration to New York County, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator.
Severability. If any term or clause within this Binding Individual Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that term or clause will be severed from this Binding Individual Arbitration Section, and the remainder of this Binding Individual Arbitration Section will be given full force and effect.
Continuation. This Binding Individual Arbitration Section shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use or the provision of the associated services to you.
Governing JurisdictionANY DISPUTE NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION AND NOT INITIATED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WILL BE LITIGATED BY EITHER PARTY IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR, IF SUCH COURT WOULD NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE MATTER, THEN ONLY IN A NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, CITY OF NEW YORK. EACH PARTY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THESE COURTS AND AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY LEGAL ACTION UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS OF USE IN ANY OTHER COURT OR FORUM. EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE VENUE OF ANY LEGAL ACTION BROUGHT UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS OF USE IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, CITY OF NEW YORK, AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN SUCH COURTS THAT ANY SUCH ACTION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
