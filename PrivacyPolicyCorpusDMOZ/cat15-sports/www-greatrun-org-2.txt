1.3.	Cookies can be set by the website you are visiting – first party cookies – or by other websites that are using another website to host content – third-party cookies. If a website embedded, say, a YouTube video, YouTube may well set a cookie when the video is viewed, this would be a ‘third-party’ cookie.
