TRADE ADVERTISING
If you are a trader acting in the course of your business, you are not permitted to place any advert as a private advert and/or otherwise pass yourself off as a private seller. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Practices Regulations 2008 requires all adverts placed by people who seek to sell goods in the course of business to make the fact clear. This requirement applies whether the advertiser is acting on his own behalf, or for some other person. Customers should be able to tell whether an advert relates to a sale by a trade or private seller. It is the responsibility of the advertiser to comply with the Regulations. If you are a trader acting in the course of your business, it is an offence, for which you may be prosecuted, not to advertise the fact that you are a trader.
We may, in our sole discretion, remove any advert that has been placed as private which we reasonably believe has been placed by a trader acting in the course of a business. In such circumstances, you will not be entitled to any refund for the advert in question and you may be charged an administration fee by us.
REFUNDS

A full refund will then be made but only if the advert has not already appeared live on the Horsequest website. (This excludes banned advertisers who will be charged an admin fee of £2.50 per advertisement, please see section on refusal of advertisements.)
No refunds will be made after the advertisement has been processed and placed live on the HorseQuest web site.  The only exceptions to this will be at HorseQuest discretion and only in exceptional circumstances. Any refunds given at this point will be subject to a £10 admin charge.
