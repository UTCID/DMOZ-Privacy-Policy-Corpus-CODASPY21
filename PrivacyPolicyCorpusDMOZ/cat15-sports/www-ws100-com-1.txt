Terms of Service
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
The Western States Endurance Run, a charitable nonprofit foundation, (“WSER”) provides a collection of online resources, including ads, forums, and various email and information services, (referred to hereafter as “the Service”) subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”). By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOS. In addition, when using particular WSER services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all WSER services, which may change from time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of the TOS, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with WSER in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.
2. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. You must review this agreement on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes. You can find the most recent version of the TOS at: http://www.wser.org/terms-of-service/
3. CONTENT
You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials (“Content”) posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item (“Item”) of Content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that WSER does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Furthermore, the WSER site and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of WSER. WSER makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will WSER be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that WSER does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that WSER shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the TOS or for any other reason.
4. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, SITES, AND SERVICES
The WSER site and Content available through the Service may contain features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third-party content which is completely independent of WSER, including web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole.
Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
You agree that WSER shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third-party, you understand and agree that WSER is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release WSER, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
5. NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT
If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please notify WSER’s agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement (“Agent”), at web-admin [at] WS100.com.
Please provide our Agent with the following Notice:
Identify the material on the WSER site that you claim is infringing, with enough detail so that we may locate it on the website;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (1) the above information in your Notice is accurate, and (2) that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of that owner;
Your address, telephone number, and email address; and
Your physical or electronic signature.
WSER will remove the infringing posting(s), subject to the procedures outlined in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA).
6. PRIVACY AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
WSER Privacy Policy is to explain to users how their information is collected and used, which is located on each site page where such collection and potential use takes place. Your use of the WSER website or the Service signifies acknowledgement of and agreement to our Privacy Policy. You further acknowledge and agree that WSER may, in its sole discretion, preserve or disclose your Content, as well as your information, such as email addresses, IP addresses, timestamps, and other user information, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; enforce the TOS; respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; respond to claims that contact information (e.g. phone number, street address) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment; protect the rights, property, or personal safety of WSER, its users or the general public.
7. CONDUCT
You agree not to post, email, or otherwise make available Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, invasive of another’s privacy, pornographic, or harmful to minors in any way.
8. POSTING AGENTS
A “Posting Agent” is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. To moderate demands on WSER’s resources, you may not use a Posting Agent to post Content to the Service without express permission or license from WSER. Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not permitted to post Content on behalf of others, to cause Content to be so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting Content on behalf of others, except with express permission or license from WSER.
9. NO SPAM POLICY
You understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements to WSER email addresses or through WSER computer systems,which is expressly prohibited by these TOS, will use or cause to be used servers operated by or on behalf of WSER. Any unauthorized use of WSER computer systems is a violation of the TOS and certain federal and state laws, including without limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1030 et seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.
10. PAID POSTINGS
We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee is an access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area. Each party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content and compliance with the TOS. All fees paid will be non-refundable.
11. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE
You acknowledge that WSER may establish limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or other Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and the frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that WSER has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that WSER reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that WSER shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
12. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE
WSER grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access the Service for your own personal use. This license does not include: (a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by WSER. A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file. “General purpose internet search engine” does not include a website or search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings or in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale, services, or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified ad listing services. WSER permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink on your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use is for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in personal web blogs or personal online media). If the total number of such postings displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100) postings, your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOS, absent express permission granted by WSER to do so. You may also create a hyperlink to the home page of WSER sites so long as the link does not portray WSER, its employees, or its affiliates in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive manner. WSER offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings through third-party software news aggregators. WSER permits you to display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS feed, proper attribution to ‘WSER’ as the source, (d) your use or display does not suggest that WSER promotes or endorses any third-party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden WSER’s systems. WSER reserves all rights in the content of the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time. Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by WSER immediately terminates said permission or license. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from WSER.
13. TERMINATION OF SERVICE
You agree that WSER, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not the obligation) to delete or deactivate your account, block your email or IP address, or otherwise terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any part thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, if WSER believes that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOS. Further, you agree that WSER shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service. Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination. Sections 2, 4, 6 and 12-18 shall survive termination of the TOS.
14. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
The Service is protected to the maximum extent permitted by copyright laws and international treaties. Content displayed on or through the Service is protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to copyrights laws, and international conventions. Any reproduction, modification, creation of derivative works from or redistribution of the site or the collective work, and/or copying or reproducing the sites or any portion thereof to any other server or location for further reproduction or redistribution is prohibited without the express written consent of WSER. You further agree not to reproduce, duplicate or copy Content from the Service without the express written consent of WSER, and agree to abide by any and all copyright notices displayed on the Service. You may not decompile or disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover any source code contained in the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any aspect of the Service. Although WSER does not claim ownership of content that its users post, by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to WSER an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the foregoing. Furthermore, by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically grant WSER all rights necessary to prohibit any subsequent aggregation, display, copying, duplication, reproduction, or exploitation of the Content on the Service by any party for any purpose.

16. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WSER BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF WSER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY ASPECT OF YOUR USE OF THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE, WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE, OR THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, MODIFICATION, ALTERATION, OR TERMINATION OF THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES INCURRED BY REASON OF OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE OR ANY LINKS ON THE WSER SITE, AS WELL AS BY REASON OF ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WSER SITE OR THE SERVICE OR ANY LINKS ON THE WSER SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. In some jurisdictions, limitations of liability are not permitted. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
17. INDEMNITY
You agree to indemnify and hold WSER, its officers, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, service providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney fees and court costs, made by any third-party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post or make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the TOS, your breach of any of the representations and warranties herein, or your violation of any rights of another.
18. GENERAL INFORMATION
The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and WSER and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and WSER. The TOS and the relationship between you and WSER shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and WSER agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California. The failure of WSER to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
19. VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
Please report any violations of the TOS, by flagging the posting(s) for review, or by emailing to: web-admin [at] WS100.com. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for WSER to pursue legal action to enforce the TOS, you will be liable to pay WSER the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of WSER’s damages for the specified breaches of the TOS: a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person’s explicit consent, you agree to pay WSER one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive parodies of public figures. b. If WSER establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay WSER one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access WSER in excess of such limits, whichever is higher. c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to WSER email addresses or through WSER computer systems, you agree to pay WSER twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email. d. If you post Content in violation of the TOS, other than as described above, you agree to pay WSER one hundred dollars ($100) for each Item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, WSER may elect to issue a warning before assessing damages. e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the TOS, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay WSER one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every Item of Content posted in violation of the TOS. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the “Principal”), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOS) agrees to pay WSER an additional one hundred dollars ($100) for each Item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the principal in violation of the TOS. f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of the TOS without WSER’s express written permission, you agree to pay WSER three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct. Otherwise, you agree to pay WSER’s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of the TOS, WSER retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in the TOS, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the TOS, or any combination thereof.
