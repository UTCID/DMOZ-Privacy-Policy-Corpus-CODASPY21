Chance to Help out a coach!
Mary Fleckenstein
Here is another chance to help Edgar Perez - our newly elected Coaches Rep and coach at NY Sharks!
Edgar has completed his chemo and radiation.  He will be having major surgery at the end of September to help him on the road to recovery.
Let's continue to show him how much we support him!
Golf outing to support him - sponsor a hole, attend - help out any way you can.
