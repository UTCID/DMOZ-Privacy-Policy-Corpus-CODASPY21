Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement or elsewhere on the Sites, the Sites, and all materials on the Sites, including images, illustrations, photographs, icons, designs, text, video clips and other materials, and the copyrights, trademarks, trade dress and/or other intellectual property in such materials (collectively, the "Contents") are owned, controlled or licensed by ECP and other trademarks appearing on the Sites are the trademarks of ECP and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates or partners.

ECP has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any Comments.
You agree that your Comments will not violate any right of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree that your Comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene material, or contain any computer virus or other malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Sites. You are not permitted to use a false e-mail address, pretend to be someone other than yourself or assume a false identity, or otherwise mislead ECP or third parties as to the origin of any Comments.

The policy also explains the ways in which you can control how we collect and use your data.
We will update this policy from time to time, as indicated on the date posted above. However, we suggest that you review this privacy policy, at this location, regularly to review any changes that may have been made.
You may exercise your choices about how we collect and use your information consistent with this policy to the extent indicated below.
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us as described in the section entitled "How do I contact you?" below.
What types of information does ECP collect?
We may collect personal information from you, which may include:
your name
your email address
your postal address or zip-code
your phone number
your credit card number
your gender
your birthday
your personal interests

when you install or use our mobile sites or apps
when you place an order online or by phone

We also collect information about the device you use to access our websites, mobile sites or apps such as your computer's IP address, your browser type, your operating system, browsing information and other technical information. Our mobile sites and apps may also collect information about your location if you permit this. We may combine all of this information with information about you that we acquire from our joint marketing partners, from unrelated third parties, and from our other brands on the Sites.

For more information about the type of information that is gathered by Google Analytics, please visit this site.
How does ECP use my information?
ECP may use your personal information in the following ways:
To contact you if necessary;
To process and fulfill your order, including to send you emails to confirm your order status and shipment;
To help us learn more about your shopping preferences;
To help us address problems with and improve our site and mobile site and app design, products and services;
To enhance your shopping experience;
To analyze trends and statistics;
To communicate with you and to send you information by email, postal mail, telephone, text message, or other means about our products, services, contests, and promotions, unless you have directed us not to contact you with promotional communications;
To administer and fulfill our contests and other promotions; and
In other ways that are consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, including the section entitled “Does ECP share my information with others?”
You may always opt out of receiving calls or other marketing information. For instructions on how to opt out, please see the section entitled "How do I make choices about receiving promotional communications?" below.
Does ECP share my information with others?
We may share your personal information in the following ways:
We may share your information when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests, or promotions to our customers.
When you provide personal information to one of our ECP brands, we may share that information with our other ECP brands.
We may share information about you if necessary, in our good faith judgment and sole discretion, to comply with laws or regulations or in response to a valid subpoena, order, or government request, or to protect the rights of ECP or others.
We may share your information with our service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling promotions, sending communications to our customers, conducting surveys, etc. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.
In addition, if you choose to participate in any third-party scrip, loyalty, or similar program in which an ECP brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize ECP or our credit card processor to provide information about your purchases to the company administering the program, we will share your personal information with that program. Scrip programs allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on ECP purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at ECP brands, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. The information you authorize us to disclose to the third-party scrip or loyalty program may include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.

How do I make choices about receiving promotional communications?
ECP wishes to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. You may opt out of communications regarding promotional information, including special offers, deals and events by contacting us at the addresses provided in the “How do I contact you?” section below or you can use the following unsubscribe links:
When you contact customer service please provide your full name and the email account you used to register your account or made a purchase from any of the ECP sites, mobile sites or apps. If you ask us to remove your name and address from promotional lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not contact" file to ensure that we can honor your request. It may take up to 10 days to process your email request and 6-8 weeks to process your postal mail request, during which period you may continue to receive communications from ECP.
If you change your mind, you can start receiving promotional communications from us again by logging into your online account and changing your preferences, by signing up when you visit our websites or when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or by contacting customer service.
