Regular customers will know just how wide-ranging its stock has become with even frozen food and clothing available in selected stores.
However even the biggest Home Bargains fans may not be aware of just all the best money-saving tips, reports The Liverpool Echo.
Here is a round-up of all the best tips for shoppers, including star buys and how to keep an eye out for special offers. It is worth noting, a version of this article was published in November and all tips were highlighted before the coronavirus pandemic. You must now follow safety measures in place at all Home Bargains stores and wear a face covering unless exempt.
1. The price tags reveal how long an item is in stock for An insider from the store has revealed how its customers can find out whether a bargain will be in stock next time they return to the shop, and it has to do with its price tags. As well as revealing the cost of an item, the price tags also reveal whether an item is a one-off or a regularly stocked product. Next time you visit Home Bargains take a look at the bottom corner of the tag on the shelf - where you should see REG or ONE. REG stands for regular, meaning regular product which will be in stock the majority of the time, and restocked when they sell out however ONE stands for one off meaning if you want it then you are probably best buying it there and then. 2. Looking for a particular item? Head to its bigger stores Like most retailers, Home Bargains' larger stores have much more choice. According to its website, it also says: "Many of our large stores receive daily stock replenishment, and the item you are looking for may be available on your next visit to store. Our smaller stores however, receive less frequent deliveries." 3. But, don't be in a rush to get inside Some of the best bargains are located near the front of the store.
