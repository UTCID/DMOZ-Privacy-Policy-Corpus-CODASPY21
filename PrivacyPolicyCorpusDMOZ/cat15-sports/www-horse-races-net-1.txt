Privacy Policy
Update your privacy and consent settings.
Information Collected: Only information voluntarily
submitted will be collected and used solely for the purpose
indicated. We will not require a Visitor to disclose more
information than is reasonably necessary to participate in
an activity on the site as a condition of such
participation. No information collected will ever be sold, shared or rented to anyone else.
As with most sites, certain non-personally identifiable
information is recorded by the standard operation of our
web host server, ICDsoft. Such information may
include: the name of the ISP from which a Visitor
accesses the Internet, the date and time a Visitor
accessed the Site, the Internet address of the Web site
from which a Visitor entered our Site and where a Visitor
goes after leaving this Site. This information is used to
measure and monitor the use of our Site and to improve
its content. Data which would personally identify a Visitor
is known only when voluntarily submitted.
Off Site Links: The content of Horse-Races.net is
designed for general use. In addition to our own content,
we may also provide links to web sites visitors may be
interested in. We do screen the other sites initially, but in
the end, we cannot be responsible for what appears on
other sites. We are also not responsible for the privacy
policies of those other sites.
This policy may change as Horse-Races.net grows.
Changes will be noted and posted.
Thanks and have fun at the site!
Cindy Pierson Dulay,
Founder Horse-Races.net
