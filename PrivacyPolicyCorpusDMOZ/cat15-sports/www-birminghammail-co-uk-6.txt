Andell Goulbourne, 59, was tragically knocked off his bicycle and sent into the air when he was struck by a grey BMW M135i on Washwood Heath Road. The dad-of-three, who recently became a great-grandad, suffered injuries so severe the family weren't allowed to see his body before he was buried. People could be seen rushing out into the street following the incident on July 30 - but West Midlands Police has since been met with a wall of silence and are desperate to trace witnesses.
His relatives say they were 'disturbed' that no one appeared to help as Andell lay dying in the street. The family have been denied closure as they continue to wait for witnesses to come forward. Two of the victim's daughters and his sister spoke out as part of a fresh appeal for information as they agreed to release harrowing CCTV footage. The family had grown concerned after a lack of contact from Andell after the 11.15pm collision. They rang all the hospitals in the city to see whether a cyclist had been brought in, but were dealt the tragic news by police the following morning. Andell's sister, Carol Gordon, told BirminghamLive: "For me, it was like we were given a life sentence, without a trial. Most of us just went into auto-pilot, because that's how we got through.

"Going down to the site, I was the first one there at the scene - and there was still blood, still live. That was disturbing anyway seeing the live blood there. "The community seemed very supportive at the time. We didn't really understand the extent of his injuries at all until we saw the video." She continued: "I haven't seen my brother, we couldn't see him at the funeral directors because the injuries were that great. "Within the black community, we do say goodbye, but there was no chapel of rest, there was no closure for us. I didn't know who they were burying until I saw the video.

"When I looked at the rest of the footage I was more disturbed because it looked like nobody helped. The normal response would be to go to the victim, go to the person who has had the accident. "This didn't happen here. I'm not judging anybody, but I'm saying to the community, you need to help us bring closure. "We cannot grieve at the moment. We just want someone to come forward. My brother was killed. Somebody needs to be responsible." His daughters, Nyesha Smith and Samantha Higgins, said the death is a 'great loss' to the community, as Andell was well-known for his volunteer work and mentoring.
Nyesha said: "Andell was a family person, he enjoyed being around people. He was a people person. He had done a lot of community work, volunteering. "He was there for us, always there. Always someone you could rely on." Police named Kashif Khan, aged 24, as a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident, as Crimestoppers offered a reward of up to £5,000 for information passed via  www.crimestoppers-uk.org or in confidence on 0800 555 111. Three men have already been interviewed about the incident. Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes, who is leading the investigation, echoed the family's plea for witnesses as he directly addressed Khan and anyone who 'helped him'.
He said: "As we go forward, we always need evidence. I need to prosecute the driver. I need those witnesses to come forward and speak to me. "We've named a man, Kashif Khan, as someone I would like to speak to in connection with that collision. Kashif - have another look at that footage and have a think. "I know that Kashif left this country 21 hours after that collision - and I'm fairly confident he didn't do that on his own, he had help and support. "Those people that helped him, have a look at that footage. I need those people to speak to us as well."
