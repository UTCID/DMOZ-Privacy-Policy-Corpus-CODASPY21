Submissions
U.S. Soccer is pleased to hear from its loyal fans and welcomes your comments regarding U.S. Soccer products and services. Unfortunately, however, U.S. Soccer’s long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by the U.S. Soccer’s professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as stories or character ideas, screenplays or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials.
If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g., postings to chatrooms, message boards or contests) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the “Submissions”), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of U.S. Soccer. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of U.S. Soccer, and U.S. Soccer shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, U.S. Soccer shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. The sender waives all so-called “moral rights” in all Submissions. The sender further waives the right to make any claims against U.S. Soccer relating to unsolicited submissions, including, but not limited to, unfair competition, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, breach of implied contract and/or breach of confidentiality.
Liability Disclaimer
THIS WEBSITE the Services AND their CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND U.S. Soccer EXCLUDES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FUNCTIONS EMBODIED ON, OR IN THE MATERIALS OF, THIS WEBSITE or the services ARE NOT WARRANTED TO BE UNINTERRUPTED OR WITHOUT ERROR. YOU, NOT U.S. Soccer, ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION DUE TO YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.
THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEBSITE or services MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. CHANGES ARE PERIODICALLY ADDED TO THE INFORMATION HEREIN. U.S. Soccer AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS MAY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND/OR CHANGES TO THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE or services AT ANY TIME.
U.S. Soccer AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND RELATED GRAPHICS CONTAINED ON THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE OR SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SUCH INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND RELATED GRAPHICS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. U.S. Soccer AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH REGARD TO THIS INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND RELATED GRAPHICS, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ADVICE RECEIVED VIA THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR PERSONAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT AN APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL FOR SPECIFIC ADVICE TAILORED TO YOUR SITUATION.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL U.S. Soccer AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE OR SERVICES, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE OR RELATED SERVICES, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND RELATED GRAPHICS OBTAINED THROUGH THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF U.S. Soccer (OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS) HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE, OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE U.S. Soccer WEBSITE.
Indemnification
Except as prohibited by law, you will hold U.S. Soccer and its officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental, or consequential damage, however it arises (including attorneys’ fees and all related costs and expenses of litigation and arbitration, or at trial or on appeal, if any, whether or not litigation or arbitration is instituted), whether in an action of contract, negligence or other tortious action, or arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, including without limitation any claim for personal injury or property damage, arising from (i) your use of and access to the Website and Services; (ii) your violation of any of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your content caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Use and your use of the Website or Services.
International users
U.S. Soccer makes no claims regarding access or use of the Website, Services, or U.S. Soccer content outside of the United States. If you use or access the Website, Services or U.S. Soccer content outside of the United States, you are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction as well as these Terms of Use.
General legal terms
The Terms of Use constitute the whole legal agreement between you and U.S. Soccer and govern your use of the Website and Services (but excluding any services which U.S. Soccer may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and U.S. Soccer in relation to the Website and Services.
You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Website and Services, which U.S. Soccer provides, may change from time to time with or without prior notice to you.
As part of U.S. Soccer’s continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that U.S. Soccer may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at U.S. Soccer’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform U.S. Soccer when you stop using the Services.
You acknowledge and agree that if U.S. Soccer disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content, which is contained in your account.
Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with U.S. Soccer, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, or resell the Services for any purpose, most especially including not sharing the data supplied by other U.S. Soccer members to law firms or other vendors who are not U.S. Soccer members. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that U.S. Soccer has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which U.S. Soccer may suffer) of any such breach.
You agree that if U.S. Soccer does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which U.S. Soccer has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of U.S. Soccer’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to U.S. Soccer.
Unless U.S. Soccer has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Services, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Services, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software. This means also that you shall not share your password or member access with non-members or ineligible members.
When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations, and liabilities that you and U.S. Soccer have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force), or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of this agreement shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations, and liabilities indefinitely.
If any disagreement or dispute arises regarding these Terms or any rights or obligations conveyed hereunder, the disagreement shall be resolved, whenever possible, by meeting and conferring. If such efforts are unsuccessful, either you or U.S. Soccer (collectively “Parties” or individually “Party”) shall seek a resolution via binding arbitration, to be conducted in the City of Chicago, Illinois USA and in accordance with the then-prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any award conferred shall be enforceable in any court of suitable jurisdiction in the City of Chicago, Illinois USA. The arbitration requirement does not apply to requests solely for injunctive relief.
Parties agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both Parties each waive any right to a jury trial. The Parties both agree that either Party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
These Terms of Use and any dispute arising hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA, without regard to conflict of laws provisions. You and U.S. Soccer agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of Chicago to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that U.S. Soccer shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.
