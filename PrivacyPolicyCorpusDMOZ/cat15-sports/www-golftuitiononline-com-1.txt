How to post a video of your golf swing
Posting a video of your golf swing is easier than you think. Most video cameras these days come with software (on a CD that comes with the video camera or via download online) that will allow you to transfer your video footage to your PC.
When you transfer this video to your PC you normally have the option to save it in various formats such as:
MPEG
AVI
Upload your video to either, youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, metacafe etc then simply click the "insert video clip" link on your post and add the video url. See this post also: How do I include a video in a post
Good Luck
