In consideration of RideStats LLC, a Minnesota limited liability corporation (“RideStats”), furnishing services to enable me to use the RideStats application in connection with activities including, but not limited to cycling, running, route planning, and/or participation in Virtual Events (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Activities”), I agree to the terms of this RideStats Waiver and Release of Liability (“Release”) as set forth herein.
I fully understand and acknowledge the following:
The Activities have inherent risks, dangers, and hazards;
My participation in the Activities carries with it the potential for property loss and serious injury or illness, including, but not limited to, bodily injury, disease, strains, fractures, partial and/or total paralysis, death or other ailments that could cause serious disability;
