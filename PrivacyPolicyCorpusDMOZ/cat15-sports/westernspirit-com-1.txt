Cancellation Policy
Our Cancellation Policy
We would hate to see you go but if something does come up here is the cancellation policy.
Should you need to cancel for any reason, we will apply the following cancellation policy: For cancellations prior to 60 days before departure, a $50 handling fee per person is retained and the remainder of your deposit is refunded. For cancellations 60-31 days before departure, 50% of your trip fees are refunded. For cancellations 30 days or less before departure, no monies are refundable.
We must adhere to our cancellation policy in order to maintain the price structure of our trips. Please do not ask us to make exceptions. We strongly recommend that you purchase trip insurance to protect your investment. Western Spirit Cycling reserves the right to cancel any trip. Full refunds will be made in these instances. Western Spirit Cycling is not responsible for non-refundable airfare.
No one plans not to come! We staunchly urge you to get travel insurance. You never know what emergencies might pop up before or during your trip. We recommend CSA Travel Protection (our producer code is 82945124). You can also call them at 800-348-9505.
COVID Amendment
If it is necessary for Western Spirit to cancel your trip due to regulations from a government entity such as the National Park Service, State, County, or City authorities, we will provide you with a full value credit for a future trip.
If it is necessary for you to cancel your trip due to illness, injury, or apprehensiveness regarding COVID-19, our normal cancellation policy will apply.
We encourage you to book a trip with us ONLY if you are sure that you can travel to the start of the trip and are confident that you would like to go on a multi-day bike ride with us.
We encourage any-and-all riders to purchase travel insurance prior to your trip and make sure you understand what is and what is not covered under your policy.
