•    Approximate Location.  We may collect the approximate location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals.  We may use your device’s location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content and so that we may serve you the correct version of the application. We may also share your device’s location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. If you no longer wish to have location-based information collected for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. If you are in the EU, please click here.  If you no longer wish to have your location collected or used, you may opt-out by turning this off at the device level.

You may correct, delete, or update some of the Personal Information associated with a particular account by, clicking here.  Other Personal Information may be corrected or updated by contacting us via: privacy@wwe.com. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law.
