Its success in expanding beyond the police to include bike stores and community groups is one reason why the World Bank believes it has potential application in other cities.We apologize, but this video has failed to load.Try refreshing your browser, ortap here to see other videos from our team.The two key figures in Project 529’s success have been Const. Rob Brunt and J Allard, who was involved in creating Xbox for Microsoft.Project 529 is celebrating its growth from 22,000 Vancouver bike registrations in 2017 to almost 70,000 in the region this year. In total, about 800,000 bikes, mostly in Canada and the U.S., are now registered with 529.“This has become a Monday to Sunday job,” Brunt said. “I’m doing stuff locally, provincially, nationally and internationally. It’s non-stop.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedIn 2015, the VPD was the first police force to adopt Project 529 — known as Garage 529 in the U.S. That happened because Brunt thought it didn’t make sense that an old Honda Accord worth $500 could be easily returned to its owner but an expensive bike worth $15,000 would go to an auction in 90 days if not claimed.When he researched online bike registration and return programs, Brunt discovered that the Project 529 app was far more sophisticated than anything else available.After the VPD adopted Project 529, a milestone occurred when it was included as part of a program to reduce bike theft on Granville Island in 2015 and 2016. Bike thefts on the island dropped by 60 per cent, which contributed to the first overall decrease in bike thefts in Vancouver in 10 years.In 2015, there were 3,131 bike thefts in Vancouver. They dropped to 2,655 in 2016 and 2,199 in 2017.Elsewhere in B.C., Project 529 led to a drop of 55 per cent in bike thefts in Whistler; in Richmond, they were down 30 per cent. Project 529 is now in 35 cities and towns in B.C.“Can you believe it?” Brunt said. “A street cop from Vancouver and an Xbox inventor have become the experts on bike thefts.”One of the big reasons for the jump in registrations in Vancouver during the past year was the way Brunt and Project 529 were able to piggy back onto the independent registration systems created by various bike stores. Thanks to a program written by Allard, Project 529 added several thousand bike registrations while respecting the privacy of the businesses.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedProject 529 in Vancouver has been so successful that Brunt and Allard travelled earlier this year to Bogotá, Colombia, a big cycling city that wants to combat bike theft. The two cities were linked by William Moose, a consultant on mobility issues for the World Bank, an international financial institution based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to fighting poverty.“We were looking at what were the best practices internationally,” Moose said by phone from Miami. “Like any good researcher, you start on Google. You look around and see what you can find. We saw that there was some really interesting stuff being done in Vancouver where the police was working with Project 529.”Moose cautioned that what he says can’t be interpreted as endorsing a private service or product. That said, he pointed out that Project 529 is a well-designed app that’s more than a bike registration program. It helps to create a community.“What we really liked about the Vancouver approach was how holistic it was, and involved a lot of players,” he said, citing the involvement of bicycle stores and the Granville Island experience that involved local businesses and community groups. “It wasn’t just a single approach. They were using multiple routes to having a positive impact.“That appealed to us because it made sense to us from a sustainability standpoint. You have the community help you to do the job from stopping bikes from getting stolen.”Moose said the World Bank is interested in promoting biking as a development issue.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continued“We believe in encouraging sustainable modes of transportation,” he said. “Cycling and walking are very low cost and equitable forms of transportation. Anything we can do to make cycling more attractive is a good investment in urban mobility.”Project 529 is involved in the fall instalment of Bike to Work Week starting Oct. 29. Project 529’s goal is to beat its previous record of registering 1,300 bikes during the week.kevingriffin@postmedia.comCLICK HERE to report a typo.Is there more to this story?
