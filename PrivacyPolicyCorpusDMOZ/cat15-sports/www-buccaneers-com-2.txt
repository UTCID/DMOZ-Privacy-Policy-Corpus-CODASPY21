CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT DISCLOSURE Effective Date: December 2019
Last Reviewed: December 2019
To the extent that the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") is applicable to Buccaneers Team LLC, this California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosure has been drafted to provide additional information to California residents whose personal information is processed by Buccaneers Team LLC.
We generally do not "sell" personal information for purposes of the CCPA. As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties.
The CCPA allows California residents to request that a business that collects consumers' personal information give consumers access, upon a verifiable consumer request, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable form, to the specific pieces and types of personal information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared. California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of personal information under certain circumstances, although there may be legal or other reasons that Buccaneers Team LLC must retain your information consistent with California law. If you choose to exercise your CCPA rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your personal information or otherwise permitted by law. Please submit your request by emailing legal@buccaneers.nfl.com or calling 1-800 795-BUCS(2827). Please note that your request will not be processed until your identity is confirmed.
