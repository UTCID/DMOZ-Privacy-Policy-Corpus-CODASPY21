•  Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (this means a reasonable expectation of running our business) unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data, which overrides those legitimate interests. (e.g. we may use your past booking information to send personalised offers to you. We may use your address details to send you direct marketing information by post, to inform you about products or services that might be of interest to you.)
You have the right to object to our using your information for our legitimate interests. However, please keep in mind that your objection to this sort of processing may affect our ability to carry out the services you have requested for your trip.
3. Why and how we use personal information
In order for us to deliver the best possible customer experience we may combine the data we collect and then use this to offer promotions on our products or services most likely to be of interest to you. The GDPR allows this (under our legitimate interest) to understand our customers and provide the best possible customer service. We use personal information for the following purposes:
•  To manage your trip (When you enquire or book a trip with us, we use your information to provide services to you, e.g. arranging transportation, tours, accommodation, etc.)
•  To process your job application (whether directly or via a 3rd party).
•  To communicate directly with you regarding services you have requested (we need to contact you via email for administrative or operational purposes, e.g. sending booking confirmation or payments receipts).
•  To meet our legal obligations (where required, such as court orders or subpoenas, or our obligation to provide your information to border control agencies).
•  To deal with requests, via phone, online web-forms or social media channels (we use the communications you exchange with us and the feedback you give to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to better our customer services and experiences).
•  To improve a personalised customer experience (We may record calls, review digital correspondence (email, webchat) for training and for general operational purposes. We may also use personal information in order to tailor our services to your preferences, thereby providing you with an improved and more personalised customer experience. E.g. if you tell us your preferred destination, subject area or position in school, we will be able to send you communications relevant to your preferences. We may also gather data about how you use our websites, such as which of our website pages you visit most, which destinations or products you search for and what products you book, in order to understand what you like. We may use this information to tailor the content and offers that you see on our website).
•  To update you about trips linked to your preferred destination or subject area (when providing your personal information through our websites or if it is available in the public domain, e.g. on a school website, we may use this data for our legitimate business interests, which is to provide educational tours. For example, to ensure digital or postal marketing is relevant for you, determined by your transactional history, your job role or known subject or destination preferences. We will also hold information about you so that we can respect your preferences for being contacted by us. When processing personal information for our legitimate interests, we always consider any potential impact on you and your rights under data protection and other relevant laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
You can also choose to opt out from receiving marketing communications at any time, by clicking on the relevant unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing related email you may receive from us.  You can also inform us of your preference not to receive marketing communications by emailing us at marketing@equity.co.uk.
