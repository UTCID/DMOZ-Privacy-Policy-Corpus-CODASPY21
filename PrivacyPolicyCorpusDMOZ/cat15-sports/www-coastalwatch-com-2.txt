Forecaster Blog: La Niña conditions are here, what does it mean for Surf?

Chief Surf Forecaster
You might already be onto the fact that we’re now entering the early stages of a La Niña event – and as long as you don’t mind a bit of wet weather, that’s usually a good thing when it comes to surf over the coming months. While a La Niña hasn’t officially been declared (the BOM is still on “La Niña Alert”), many of the key tropical Pacific Ocean indicators are continuing to slide towards a full blown, borderline moderate La Niña event. Those indicators include:Below average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sub-surface temperatures across the central and eastern tropical Pacific.Above average SSTs over the tropical western Pacific Ocean.Changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern, including above average tradewinds at the surface.
The signature of a La Nina: Cool SST anomalies over the tropical central-eastern Pacific and warm SST anomalies across the tropical western Pacific. Source: BOM.
But just what does that mean for surf potential in the rest of 2020 and early 2021? That’s the question I’ve been looking at over the past few weeks – and to be honest, there’s no simple answer. However, scroll a bit further down and you’ll find an analysis of spring surfing conditions during previous La Niña years, specifically looking at the 2007/08 and 2010/11 events.
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Walker CirculationFirst let’s take a couple of steps back and look at exactly what ENSO describes. ENSO is a natural atmospheric cycle encompassing the tropical Pacific Ocean. It describes a process known as Walker Circulation, whereby tropical heat is moved via easterly trade-winds, transporting warm water and air from east to west. That warm, moist air eventually rises over northern Australia and the Coral Sea, condensing to form clouds, precipitation and general storminess during the Southern Hemisphere summer. Now drier and cooler, the air is then transported back east at high altitudes, where it sinks back down over the eastern Pacific Ocean.

La Niña: The supercharged version of the ENSO cycle. La Niña occurs when easterly tradewinds are stronger than average. This has the dual effects of causing warm, tropical water to pool over the western Pacific Ocean (including the Coral Sea) while causing cooler than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. These mechanisms create a feedback loop, effectively sending the Walker Circulation into overdrive.The above average SSTs over the western Pacific Ocean can result in an earlier onset of the monsoon and a higher incidence of tropical lows, troughs, and tropical cyclones in the Australian region throughout the season. That can also spill over to above average easterly swell activity over the Tasman Sea.
La Nina conditions: The Walker circulation goes into overdrive. Source: NOAA.
ENSO is only One of the Big Drivers of Australian ClimateOf course, it’s really not that cut and dried. ENSO and the impending La Niña are just one driver of Australia’s weather and surf-potential. There’s also the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the the Southern Annular Mode.
Weakly Negative IOD: The IOD is basically the Indian Ocean’s version of ENSO. Positive and negative phases of the IOD also fluctuate with shifts in the SST profile across the tropical Indian Ocean. A majority of climate models predict a weakly negative IOD throughout October, before it returns to neutral in November.
A negative IOD often goes hand in hand with a La Nina. This year it's looking weakly negative to neutral. Source: BOM.
Many particularly strong La Niña events, go hand in hand with a negative IOD. That’s characterised by warmer than average SST’s pooling over the tropical Indian Ocean, around Indonesia and near Australia. That also enhances convection over the tropical north-west, contributing to above average rainfall and also a higher incidence of low pressure moving west to east across the mainland – in theory flowing through to a higher incidence of easterly swell sources for the East Coast.
A negative IOD can bring plenty of weather across the mainland, enhancing rainfall - and eventually swell-potential for the East Coast. Source: BOM.
Past La Niña Years: 2007/08 and 2010/11The crux of it is that no two seasons are the same. Each year we see a unique set of atmospheric drivers producing a unique surf season. But we can look at what the surf was like during previous La Niña events — just to get an inkling of what we might see in the way of swell over the coming months.The last strong La Niña event was a decade ago, when the SOI fell well below zero, peaking at -1.7 during the Spring/ Summer of 2010. Prior to that, there was a moderate event back in 2007/08. You might recall that the transition towards La Niña during the 2007 winter saw a cluster of ECLs, producing a good to epic run of large surf, drawing parallels with the spectacular procession of Tasman lows that left us reeling over the 2020 winter.
Remember this? Throughout history, big swings in ENSO are linked clusters of major swell events across the East Coast. Photo: Phillip Morris.
Spring in previous La Niña events: So let’s take a look at MSLP anomalies for the some of the spring months – and how that translated into surf for the region.The 2010/11 Niña was one of the biggest events on record – and the developing 2020/21 event is unlikely to come close. Nevertheless, it gives us an insight into what we might see as La Niña continues to develop over the coming weeks. October 2010 saw a monster, +7 high pressure anomaly straddling the Tasman Sea and NZ, producing a strong easterly bias in the swell regime throughout the month.
A strong high pressure anomaly over the Tasman Sea saw a predominant easterly bias in the swell regime across the eastern seaboard throughout October 2010. Source: BOM.
Here’s one example of a coastal trough interacting with the subtropical ridge, setting up an extended run of east swell for the region through early to mid October. Source: BOM.
Southern Queensland benefited from a couple of solid east and ESE swells through the first half of the month; the second event showing several days of solid surf in the 4 to 6ft+ range with mostly favourable winds from October 10 to 13.
Coastalwatch’s surf report history illustrates the consistent trend in easterly swell across southern Queensland throughout October.
Sydney and surrounds also benefited from a solid run of easterly swell, peaking at more modest 3-5 foot levels around the 12th and 13th, backed up by a new run of SSE swell on the 17th and 18th.
Although not as big, the southern half of the NSW coast also received its fair share of easterly swell.
In contrast, the 2007/08 La Niña was a moderate event. Once again, we saw a high pressure anomaly developing over the Tasman Sea throughout spring, that by November was showing uncanny similarity to the 2010 pattern depicted above:
Through October and November ’07 a similarly strong high pressure anomaly developed over the Tasman Sea. Source: BOM.
Most of October saw small to mid-sized south swell across the NSW coast, but that all changed as the high pressure anomaly strengthened towards the end of the month:
An extended run of small to mid-sized ENE swell followed the development of a high and coastal trough over the eastern interior into the end of October 2007. Source: BOM.
Across Sydney and surrounds, most of October 2007 featured a consistent run of south swell, capped off with several days of fun-sized ENE swell into the end of the month.
October 2007 was nothing to write home about across Sydney, but there was no shortage of surf from the south - and later in the month from the east.
There was no shortage of easterly swell across southern Queensland, but it was mostly small scale stuff, ranging from 1-3 feet for most of November.
There was plenty of east swell across southern QLD throughout November 2007, but size wise, it was pretty modest.
Stay tuned for a follow up on surf potential for the 2020/21 summer as the La Nina event continues to develop.
