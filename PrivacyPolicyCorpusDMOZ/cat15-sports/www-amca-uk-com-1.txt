How can I start?
This all depends on what discipline you want to start with – some require you to take a licence whilst others are more flexible and allow you to turn up and ride. Once you have opted for a discipline, see the FAQ for more tailored questions.
What is the difference between motocross, enduro, and trials?
These are all different disciplines the AMCA caters for, along with much more. Motocross is fast paced, short races over both natural and man-made terrain with 36 riders going into a first corner. Enduro is more long distance, long duration events, usually through woodland. Trials is slow paced, technical, balance based over challenging short course with the object to go through without putting your foot on the floor.
How old do I have to be?
The AMCA accepts riders from the age of 6 for trials, 7 for motocross, 11 for enduro and supermoto, and 16 for classic scrambles.
