It has been endorsed by numerous organizations—including the Livestrong Foundation—and was adapted for use as a source of information for our donors.	The Donor Bill of RightsPhilanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights: 		To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.

To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors. 		To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of persons or entities that the Foundation does not control manage or employ.The Foundation knows that you care how information about you is used. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.	What information does the Foundation collect from me as an end user?You can browse our Sites without telling us who you are or giving us any personally identifiable information about yourself. When you interact with us through your computer, our Site does record certain non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our Sites.In order to tailor the information on this Site to your specific needs, you may, at your sole discretion, elect to complete a profile or register with the Foundation in order to purchase products, make donations or participate in events on-line.If you elect to complete a profile or register with the Foundation, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may include among other things your name, address, age, gender, e-mail address, phone-number, fax number, date of birth, whether you are a cancer survivor, type of cancer, phase of survivorship and other healthcare information (collectively referred to as "Profile Information"). Once you provide us with this information you are no longer anonymous to us. We also collect personally identifiable information, such as your user name and password, whenever you login to your account and may in limited circumstances ask you to provide credit card information and other personally identifiable information when purchasing items that are offered for sale or when making a donation. We reserve the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account.Some of the programs and activities on our Sites could require the provision of personally identifiable information about you beyond what it is in your Profile Information and you may voluntarily choose to participate in such programs and activities.Our Sites employ "cookies," which are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. We employ "cookies" to perform three functions: to let us know how long you are logged on to our Sites and to automatically log you out if you are inactive for over thirty minutes; to store your user ID and password so that when you return to our Site you won't have to re-enter some or all of that information; and to provide us with statistics regarding what pages of our Sites you visited, and how long you spent there. You may configure your browser to accept all "cookies," reject all "cookies," or notify you when a "cookie" is sent. However, when accessing an area that requires a password for entry, "cookies" are not optional and continued paths through the password area will not continue if cookies are not enabled.	Information Collected Off-SiteThe Foundation also places advertisements on partner websites and approved third party locations. In addition to collecting data on our Sites, the Foundation is able to obtain personally identifiable information from your voluntary registration through advertising links. The purpose of these ad units is to provide you with a convenient and user-friendly registration option. Registration through off-site links will require the same personal information as the profile completion described previously. The voluntary information you provide is transmitted directly to the Foundation and treated identically to data collected from our own Sites. As noted above, you may customize your browser settings to match your comfort level with regard to the use of cookies on alternate websites.
