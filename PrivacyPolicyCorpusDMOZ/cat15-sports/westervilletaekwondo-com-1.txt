The skills that I learned from Mr. and Mrs. Perdue have shaped the person that I am today. I cannot overstate how influencial they have been and how grateful I am of the environment they built at the Taekwondo school.
Perdue's is an excellent taekwondo school for all ages. The staff create a welcoming environment and teach more than a martial art. They emphasize self discipline and a good work ethic while still making classes enjoyable (because this should be fun). From helping develop lasting friendships as a kid to a professional network as an adult, this school has had a huge impact on my life. Cannot recommend enough
I love Perdue's!!! All of the instructors care about the kids and they are so awesome!!! My kids have learned so much and gained so much self confidence!!!!
