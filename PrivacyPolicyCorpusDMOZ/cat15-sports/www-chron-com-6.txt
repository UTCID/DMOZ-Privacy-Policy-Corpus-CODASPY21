A viral CNN video report showing Houstonians being evicted from their homes during a pandemic moved Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.
One of the Houston residents in the three-minute video was 24-year-old Israel Rodriguez, who was shown being forced out of his apartment and having to load any belongings he could into his baby's stroller. Another person in the video was an unnamed elderly woman, who was being evicted, but then the deputy from the Harris County's Constable Office decided to call social services and give her more time.
"This is crazy," Watson tweeted Thursday. "Someone please help me find Israel Rodriguez and the elderly women in this video. Would love to help them get back on their feet."

The Harris County Precint 1 Office has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for the evicted tenants.
Watson has been active in the community ever since being drafted by the Texans in 2017. Last month, he teamed up with Reliant Energy to donate $175,000 to help provide computers for Houston kids who need the help while having to attend school remotely. This week, he provided backpacks and school supplies for 500 students at Houston's Pro-Vision Academy. As a rookie, he donated his first NFL check to help three Houston Texans cafeteria workers who lost everything in Hurricane Harvey.

Watson currently is playing under a four-year, $13.85 million contract. The Texans can pick up his option for next season, which would be worth $17.5 million, but both sides are working on a new contract that would pay him in excess of $40 million per year.
