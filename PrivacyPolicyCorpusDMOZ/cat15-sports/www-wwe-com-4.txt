Terms and Conditions of Use
Español
Updated as of July 9, 2020
These Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms of Use”) contain disclaimers of warranties, disclaimers of liability, and a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver.  Please read them carefully.
General
These Terms of Use apply to this website, all related WWE websites (each a “WWE Website”), mobile applications, and services (including WWE’s subscription video streaming service (the “WWE Network”)) that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”) unless we have posted special terms of use to a particular website or with respect to a particular service.  In that case, those special terms of use apply to that website or service to the extent that they are different from these Terms of Use. The Services are provided by or on behalf of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. or its affiliates or subsidiaries ("WWE", “we”, “us”).  By using the Services, you signify your agreement to these terms and conditions of these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use the Services.
Please note that these Terms of Use contain capitalized words or phrases.  These words and phrases are defined terms.  Their definitions are found either in our Privacy Policy or in these Terms of Use. To help you use our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use we have made some words, phrases and headings into hyperlinks.  These words, phrases and headings have color highlighting.
These Terms of Use apply to you whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you are simply visiting a WWE website) or a "Registered Fan" (which means that you have registered with WWE to participate in online activities or paid subscription services).  The term "User" refers to both a Visitor and a Registered Fan.  Registered Fans are also referred to simply as "Fans."  The term "Membership" refers to a Registered Fan's account and ability to post to and participate in activities and services hosted on a WWE website.  If you wish to become a Registered Fan, you must read these Terms of Use and indicate your agreement with these Terms of Use and with any other instructions or requirements that may be part of a registration process.
PLEASE NOTE: Eligibility. Membership is void where prohibited. Fans may not register with the Services unless: (a) all registration information you submit is accurate, current and complete; (b) you agree to maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.  Participation in the Services includes, but is not limited to, postings to or other forms of participation with forums, blogs, groups, comments, chats, or the submission of photos, videos or other content ("Participation"). Any content generated by a User involving the use of any functionality of a WWE Website is referred to as "User-Generated Content."
Any User-Generated Content may be deleted and your registration may be cancelled without warning, if we believe that you are under 13 years of age, if we believe that you are under 18 years of age and you represent yourself as 18 or older, or if we believe you are over 18 and represent yourself as under 18. You may not engage in any form of Participation on behalf of another person and if we believe you have, WWE reserves the right to remove it.
We may change these Terms of Use at any time. We suggest that you review these Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your use of the Services after the posting of changes to these Terms of Use will mean you accept the changes. Where, however any change to these Terms of Use is a material change (i.e. not one which is merely a small or technical change which does not affect you in any material way) or, in the case of the WWE Network, we make a significant change to the basis on which the WWE Network is made available to you (including, for Month-to-Month Recurring Subscriptions, a change in the price payable by you each month) we will notify you of the relevant change(s) by email, using the email address you provided to us at registration. If the change is an increase in monthly subscription price, or if it materially disadvantages you, we will notify you at least one month before the change takes effect, giving you the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the relevant change comes into effect. Your continued use of the Services after the changes come into effect (and, in the case of any paid subscription, your failure to cancel the same within the relevant notice period) will mean you accept the changes. If a material change to these Terms of Use (or to the WWE Network itself) needs to be made more quickly for security, legal or regulatory reasons, we will give you as much notice as we are reasonably able to give you. The most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use will always be available on the WWE website and when we notify you that the Terms of Use are changing we recommend that you print the latest version for your records.
WWE may also offer other services from time to time that are governed by different terms and conditions of use. You will be provided with a copy of such terms and conditions of use prior to you contracting to receive such services. The Services are based in the United States. By using the Services and/or by submitting personal information to the Services, you consent to having your information transferred to the United States and being processed and maintained in the United States, subject to applicable U.S. laws. U.S. laws may be different than the law of your home country. For New Zealand based subscribers, see our Privacy Policy for more details on the transfer of your personal information.

Registration and Payment for WWE Network
Registration Process.  Users may register for a subscription to WWE Network, here. By registering for a subscription to WWE Network, you warrant that (1) you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority, where older under local law, (2) all information you provided during the registration process is true and accurate, (3) you will not permit third parties to access your account information, or to otherwise assign or transfer your rights to the Services, (4) you are the cardholder of any credit or debit you provide to us, or the account holder of any PayPal account you provide to us and (5) you will provide us with a current, valid and accepted method of payment, currently credit card, debit card, PayPal account and, in select countries, WWE Network prepaid gift card (as such may be updated from time to time, the “Payment Method”) throughout the term of your subscription. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration and login information.  You are responsible for all charges incurred during your use of WWE Network and the related services, including any charges incurred on your account by other parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE WWE NETWORK IS SUBJECT TO OUR ACCEPTANCE AND CONFIRMATION TO YOU, WHICH MAY BE GIVEN OR REFUSED IN OUR SOLE REASONABLE DISCRETION.
Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription. All subscriptions are on a month-to-month recurring basis (except for the 12 Month Gift Subscription described below), beginning on the date we confirm that we have accepted your order for the WWE Network and continuing for recurring one (1) month periods from the date on which you make your first payment for your subscription to WWE Network unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it (in each case in accordance with these Terms of Use). If you purchase a Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription, then each month of your subscription beginning on the date on which your first payment is payable to us, we will charge your Payment Method and you authorize us to collect the applicable subscription payment and applicable taxes.  You can cancel your subscription at any time, but you must cancel your subscription before it renews for a subsequent month in order to avoid being charged for the subsequent month’s subscription fees.  UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT APPLICABLE MONTHLY PERIOD THAT YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE (1) MONTH PERIODS AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENT AND APPLICABLE TAXES.
12 Month Gift Subscription. The 12 Month Gift Subscription may be purchased for yourself or used as a gift for someone else and grants the recipient access to the WWE Network, beginning on the date the recipient registers for the paid subscription and ending 12 months thereafter. THIS IS A 12 MONTH FIXED TERM CONTRACT WHICH IS PAID FOR IN FULL IN ADVANCE. IN CONTRAST TO A MONTH TO MONTH RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION, IT CANNOT BE CANCELLED WITHOUT CAUSE DURING THE 12 MONTH TERM.
Promotional Offers. We may offer special promotional plans or memberships with unique terms and conditions (“Promotional Subscriptions”). These Terms of Use apply to all Promotional Subscriptions and any different terms from those described here will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. If we ask for your Payment Method for a Promotional Subscription, unless expressly stated otherwise, Promotional Subscriptions will automatically convert to a paid Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription (unless you cancel the service before the Promotional Subscription ends). Upon the expiration of your Promotional Subscription your Payment Method will be processed, subject to all Terms of Use, including any automatic renewal and/or recurring subscription terms detailed above.  It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from us that your Promotional Subscription has ended or that your Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription has begun.  We reserve the right to determine in our absolute discretion your Promotional Subscription eligibility and to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our Promotional Subscription offers.
Free Trials. Access to WWE Network may be made available to you for free for a limited time (a “Trial Subscription”). Trial Subscriptions are for new and certain former subscribers only. WWE reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your Trial Subscription eligibility. All of the Terms of Use apply to Trial Subscriptions and such Trial Subscription does not decrease the minimum subscription commitments of a paid subscription (accordingly, by way of example, if your Trial Subscription is for 14 days and upon expiry of that period it then, in accordance with the relevant promotion (and these Terms of Use), converts to a paid Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription, your minimum paid subscription period would be one month from the date on which your paid subscription started (and not one month from the date on which your Trial Subscription started)). If you register for a Trial Subscription, please carefully review the conditions of the Trial Subscription.  In some cases, users agree to subscribe to WWE Network on a paid basis at the end of their Trial Subscription, unless they cancel the service before the Trial Subscription ends.  If we ask for your Payment Method for a Trial Subscription and you do not affirmatively cancel the Service before your Trial Subscription ends, then your Payment Method will be processed and your subscription will be converted into a paid subscription, subject to all Terms of Use, including any automatic renewal and/or recurring subscription terms detailed above.  Your paid subscription will be treated as starting on the date on which your Trial Subscription was converted to a paid subscription.  It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from us that your Trial Subscription has ended or that your paid subscription has begun.  IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION CONVERTED INTO A PAID SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SERVICE BEFORE THE END OF YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BY CALLING 1-833-CALL-WWE (1-833-225-5993) (IF YOU ARE IN THE UNITED STATES) OR +1 512-225-6300 (IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THOUGH PLEASE NOTE INTERNATIONAL CALL CHARGES MAY STILL APPLY) OR BY CLICKING THE “CANCEL” LINK IN THE CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION SECTION OF YOUR WWE NETWORK ACCOUNT ON THE WEB OR IF YOU ARE A SUBSCRIBER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (“UK”), IRELAND OR NEW ZEALAND, YOU MAY ALSO USE THE CANCELLATION FORM (WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE).
WWE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS IN THE UK AND IRELAND ONLY: If you are a subscriber to the WWE Network in the UK or Ireland, please note that any Trial Subscription does not affect your legal rights to cancel during the ‘Cooling-Off Period’ (see further Cancellation/Refund Policy below). Accordingly, the Cooling-Off Period commences at the start of any Trial Subscription and if the Cooling-Off Period is longer than the Trial Subscription, your right to cancel (as set out below) will continue until the end of the Cooling-Off Period, notwithstanding the expiry of your Trial Subscription.
Discontinuation of WWE Network.  If we discontinue the WWE Network service, then we (i) will notify you by email, at the email address you provide to us during registration,(ii) may provide you with information about similar or new Services, and (iii) reserve the right to cancel the applicable service. We will give you at least one month’s notice of a discontinuation of the WWE Network. For Month-to-Month Recurring Subscriptions, we will not take payment from you for the month in which the discontinuation is effective (or thereafter). For a 12 Month Gift Subscription, you will be entitled to a partial refund in respect of the unexpired part of the relevant 12 month period following the date of discontinuation.
Billing Information.  Should you register for a Month-to-Month Subscription, we automatically bill your Payment Method each month, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paid subscription (which will be set out on the page of the WWE website on which you made your order (and which may be later than the date on which we confirm acceptance of your order)).  Should you purchase a 12 Month Gift Subscription, we bill your Payment Method once in full on the date set out on the page of the WWE website on which you made your order (and which may be later than the date on which we confirm acceptance of your order).   Our billing services may be provided by Dice Technology (“Dice”) and payments for WWE Network may appear on a user’s bill as being charged to Dice, or to another related vendor we use for this purpose.  As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment collection, as applicable, against your Payment Method.
WWE Network Gift Cards. WWE Network gift cards (including electronic gift codes) (collectively “Gift Cards”) are prepaid, one time use cards and are only redeemable for a WWE Network subscription in countries where the service is offered in the currency denominated on the Gift Card or where the currency denominated on the card is the local currency. To redeem a Gift Card, go to www.wwe.com/redeem and enter the card’s PIN. You must create or have an existing valid Membership (i.e. be a Registered Fan) in order to redeem a Gift Card. Membership and use of the WWE Network is subject to acceptance of these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. Gift Cards may be offered for various pre-paid subscription periods and the entire value of the Gift Card will be applied to your WWE Network account upon redemption. If you are an active subscriber to WWE Network at the time of Gift Card redemption, the value of the Gift Card will be added to the end of your current subscription period and upon expiration of the pre-paid subscription period, provided you do not cancel before such date, your subscription will continue and we will charge your current Payment Method on file. Upon expiration of the Gift Card pre-paid subscription period, if you do not have a current Payment Method on file, your access to WWE Network will be terminated. Gift Cards are not refundable or redeemable for cash, except to the extent required by applicable law. Gift cards are not redeemable on iTunes or Apple TV for WWE Network subscriptions. Gift Cards cannot be reloaded or resold and once redeemed are non-transferable. Gifts Cards do not expire and are not subject to any transaction fees. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Title to the Gift Cards and the risk of loss, destruction or deterioration pass to the purchaser upon purchase. WWE is not responsible for any Gift Cards that are lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission. In the event a Gift Card is non-functional, your sole remedy, and our sole liability, will be the replacement of such Gift Card.  Gift Cards are issued by World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.
Sales / Use Taxes. WWE may be required to collect sales or use tax for certain purchases, including for the purchase of WWE Network subscriptions.  In states or regions that impose a sales or use tax, certain purchases might be subject to tax even if WWE is not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region.  A purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet, by catalog, or by other remote means. Whether sales or use tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of the tax charged depends on a number of factors including whether the seller is subject to a tax collection obligation in that state or region.  The purchaser may be responsible for any taxes not collected by WWE.  Certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return annually reporting taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay such tax.  For details, see the website of the applicable taxing authority.  If WWE collects sales or use tax in connection with a purchase, the amount of the tax will either be shown prior to completion of the purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase.
KENTUCKY: WWE is not required to and does not collect Kentucky sales or use tax.  The Commonwealth of Kentucky requires Kentucky purchasers to report all purchases of tangible personal property or digital property that are not taxed by the retailer and pay use tax on those purchases unless exempt under Kentucky law. The tax may be reported and paid on the Kentucky individual income tax return or by filing a consumer use tax return with the Kentucky Department of Revenue. These forms and corresponding instructions may be found on the Kentucky Department of Revenue's Internet Web site, http://revenue.ky.gov/.
OKLAHOMA: WWE is not required to and does not collect Oklahoma sales or use tax. The State of Oklahoma requires Oklahoma purchasers to report all purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases unless exempt under Oklahoma law.  The tax may be reported and paid on the Oklahoma individual income tax return [Form 511] or by filing a consumer use tax return [Form 21-1]. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission website, www.tax.ok.gov.
WWE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS IN NEW ZEALAND ONLY: Unless otherwise expressly stated, all prices and other consideration will include Goods and Services Tax (GST), if applicable.
Cancellation/Refund Policy. You may only cancel your subscription to WWE Network in accordance with these Terms of Use.  To cancel your subscription, you may either (i) call 1-833-CALL-WWE (1-833-225-5993) (if you are in the United States) or +1 512-225-6300 (if you are outside of the United States, though please note international call charges may still apply); or (ii) click on the “Cancel” link in the Billing Information section of your WWE Network account.    Cancellations will only be effective at the end of each subscription period. Except only as otherwise expressly set out in these Terms of Use, SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS, PARTIAL REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS OR PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS.  This means that you will have continued access to WWE Network for the remainder of the current subscription period and will not receive a refund.
WWE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS IN NEW ZEALAND ONLY: If you are subscriber to the WWE Network in New Zealand, the cancellation/refund policy applies as set out in the above paragraph. You may use the methods above to cancel your subscription or you may also use the cancellation form (which can be found here). Please note, in addition, that you may have a legal right to cancel your subscription and receive a partial refund in circumstances where we are unable to make available to you your subscription or the WWE Network and we are unable to provide an adequate alternative service. In those circumstances, you may have a right to cancel and obtain a partial refund of your monthly subscription fee, the partial refund being the portion of the month remaining, as at the time of cancellation.
WWE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS IN UK AND IRELAND ONLY: If you are a subscriber to the WWE Network in the UK or Ireland, the cancellation/refund policy applies as set out in the above paragraph. You may use the methods above to cancel your subscription or you may also use the cancellation form (which can be found  here). However, please note, in addition, that you have a legal right to cancel your subscription and receive a full refund (if we have taken any payments) at any time during the period commencing from the time at which we accept your order for the WWE Network and ending at the end of the 14th full day after the date on which we accepted your order (“Cooling-Off Period”) (unless you have started using the WWE Network services included in your subscription, in which case you consent to WWE beginning with the performance of the WWE Network services before the end of the Cooling-Off Period and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal). Please note that if you have benefitted from a Trial Subscription, the Cooling-Off Period itself will expire at the end of the 14th full day after the date on which your Trial Subscription started (however long the Trial Subscription period is). For the avoidance of doubt, however, if your Trial Subscription period is longer than the Cooling-Off Period, your right to cancel without incurring any charges would continue for the remainder of the Trial Subscription period (subject to and in accordance with the terms of the relevant Trial Subscription). If you have a Month-to-Month Recurring Subscription, you may cancel it without cause at any time, but PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ANY CANCELLATIONS MADE IN THIS WAY AFTER EXPIRY OF THE COOLING-OFF PERIOD WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THE RELEVANT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH IN WHICH THE CANCELLATION IS MADE.  This means that if you cancel for convenience after the Cooling-Off Period, you will have continued access to WWE Network for the remainder of the then current subscription month and will not receive a refund.  Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.
Right Of Withdrawal. To the extent allowed under applicable law, your right of withdrawal is hereby waived. If your country of residence gives you a right of withdrawal and such right may not be waived hereunder in accordance with applicable law, you may cancel your subscription to the WWE Network prior to the expiration of your country of residence’s “cooling-off period” (“Right of Withdrawal Period”) and be eligible for a full refund (if we have taken any payment). If you have started using the WWE Network services included in your subscription, you consent to WWE beginning with the performance of the WWE Network services before the end of such Right of Withdrawal Period and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ANY CANCELLATIONS MADE IN THIS WAY AFTER EXPIRY OF YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE’S RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL PERIOD WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THE RELEVANT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH IN WHICH THE CANCELLATION IS MADE. This means that if you cancel for convenience after the Right of Withdrawal Period, you will have continued access to WWE Network for the remainder of the then current subscription month and will not receive a refund.
System Requirements.  WWE Network is a streaming service that supports 720p HD streaming, subject to content availability, device limitations and bandwidth.  WWE content is streamed over the Internet, not downloaded, so you must be connected to the Internet in order to view video content.  System and Internet connectivity requirements to watch WWE on your TV through connected devices, mobile devices, and computers may be found here.
Access to Services:  Access to WWE Network is subject to approval of your Payment Method information and verification of other information you submit to us or that is otherwise provided to us.  Accordingly, if your payment (flat fee or monthly) cannot be processed for any reason, including because your Payment Method is no longer valid, we may terminate your access to the WWE Network immediately. Although your WWE Network subscription is accessible on a number of devices, your use is limited to one (1) WWE Network stream on one (1) device at any given time.  IF YOU CIRCUMVENT OR ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT ANY OF THE USE RESTRICTIONS IN THESE TERMS, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL ACTION.  SHARING OF LOGIN INFORMATION, INCLUDING PASSWORDS, IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
Security
WWE takes the security of your personal information seriously. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the security and integrity of your personal information, but please be aware that no solution for online and mobile security can be 100% effective.  To the extent we collect payment information and/or shipping or billing information from you through the Services, we provide your payment information and billing and shipping information to service providers that help us to process and ship the goods or provide the services you purchase through this web site. Those vendors are solely responsible for how they use that information and any other information they independently acquire from you or about you. For more information on how WWE and our service providers and affiliates use and protect the personal information and payment information you may provide through this web site, please click here to review our Privacy Policy.
To protect the security of your payment information in transmission, we employ reasonable technological measures including, where appropriate, Transport Layer Security technology (formerly referred to as secure socket layer technology (SSL) technology). When appropriate, we also may encrypt your payment information when we store your order and whenever we transfer that information to participating vendors or take other appropriate steps to protect the security of your personal information.
Please keep in mind that whenever you provide personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While WWE strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online; you make such disclosures at your own risk. You may not use or attempt to use the Services to collect personal information about other persons or in any other manner that is inconsistent with another person's privacy or personal data protection rights.
When you register as a Fan or when you register for certain Services, you will also be asked to choose a username, password or other identification information intended to restrict access to  Participation and to otherwise protect your Membership from unauthorized access. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and other identification information. You agree not to use the account, username, password or other identification information of another Fan at any time or to disclose your identification information to any third party.  You agree to notify WWE immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your identification information.  You are solely responsible for any and all use of your account.  For the protection of Fans, WWE reserves the right to require or install revised account access procedures or applications at any time even though this may temporarily block access to certain parts of the Services.
Monitoring of Services
WWE expressly reserves the right to monitor any and all uses of the Services. However, WWE is under no obligation to do so, and we assume no responsibility or liability arising from our doing so or failure to do so.  We assume no responsibility or liability arising from or relating to the content of any transmissions by third parties to or through the Services or for any error, omission, defamatory or libelous statement, falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity or inaccuracy contained in any information transmitted by third parties to or through any location on the Services.
You may not post or transmit any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law or any of these Terms of Use, or any other term or condition of use posted on the Services.
Please note that we will release your personal or payment information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order or other legal process.  WWE may also disclose your personal or payment information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to detect or prevent fraud and to protect the rights, property, health or personal safety of WWE, WWE employees, our third party licensors, customers or the public.  We may also disclose your personal or payment information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to do so or if necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us.  Please see the Privacy Policy for more information about the circumstances under which we might release your personal or payment information.
Submissions
At times, WWE may solicit from Visitors to WWE Websites information that includes but is not limited to, creative ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, suggestions, ideas, artwork or other materials. Of course, Visitors to a WWE Website have the ability to submit information of this type to us at any time even if we do not solicit it. Collectively this type of information, whether solicited by us or not, and whether or not posted to this Site or any other WWE Website, is referred to as "Submissions".
WWE does not want any video Submissions which involve stunts, tricks, or maneuvers that replicate, mimic, or portray in any fashion, the activities undertaken by WWE athletes and personnel.  WWE would like to remind you that its Superstars are trained sports entertainers. You should never try to emulate what they do in and out of the ring.
By submitting any Submission, whether solicited by us or not, you are automatically granting WWE an ownership right and a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide and irrevocable right and license to sell, rent, transfer, sub-license, use, reproduce, modify, publish, translate, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, perform, display or otherwise utilize such Submissions, in whole or in part, in any form, media or technology known or hereafter developed for any purpose, including, but not limited to, advertising and promotional purposes (collectively, "Rights").
This grant of Rights means that all Submissions will be owned by WWE and may be used by WWE for any purpose, now or in the future, without any payment to, or further authorization by, you. All Submissions, whether solicited or unsolicited, shall become and remain the property of WWE. WWE also has the right, but not the obligation, to use your name or the name of any entity owned or controlled by you in connection with the broadcast, print, online or other use or publication of your Submission. We assume no responsibility for reviewing such Submissions and we will not incur any liability as a result of any similarities between your Submissions and future WWE products or programs. In submitting a Submission to us, you represent that you have no reasonable basis to believe that the use of any such Submission by us would infringe upon the rights of any third-party. You also waive any moral rights you have in and to any Submission you post, upload or transmit to the WWE Websites.
Third Party Content
Please exercise discretion while browsing the Internet or using the Services. You should be aware that while using the Services you could be directed to other web sites by links and other features found on the Services. If you click on those links or other features, you may be visiting a web site or service that is not owned or operated by WWE and over which WWE has no control. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you to the web site of a company that is not related to WWE and over which WWE has no control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, content partners and other users that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or affiliate agreement. These other web sites or services may collect data, solicit personal information and generate cookies on your computer in a manner different from our Services. These other web sites or services may also contain information that you may find inappropriate or offensive.

By providing access to third party web sites or advertisements, WWE is not endorsing the products or services provided by the owner or operator of such web sites. Consequently, we will not be liable or responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, reliability, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in third party web sites or services linked to the Services. We cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services you purchase from a third party that links to or from the Services or that you purchase through third party advertising or content on the Services. We do not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, payment information and other personal information) you might be requested to give any third party, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to the products, services and content of third party web sites, including third party web sites or services accessible by links from the Services.

Commenting on WWE.com and other Services
WWE has created opportunities on WWE Websites for our fans so that they can have a safe and enjoyable place to interact with other fans, express themselves, and support their favorite WWE Superstars.  In order to maximize this opportunity for all WWE fans, WWE requires that fans agree to the following terms when they participate in commenting on WWE Websites.
A. Post only appropriate content
What follows are examples of the kind of content that is illegal or prohibited to post anywhere on a WWE Website.  WWE reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in WWE's sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, removing the offending content and terminating the registration of such violators.  Prohibited content includes, but is not limited to, content that:
Harasses or advocates violence or harassment of another person;
Publicly posts information that poses or creates a privacy or security risk to any person;
Constitutes or promotes information that you know if false or misleading or promotes illegal activities or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory or libelous;
Constitutes or promotes an illegal or unauthorized copy of another person's copyrighted work;
Is patently offensive and promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual;
Contains nudity, excessive violence, or offensive subject matter or contains a link to an adult website;
Solicits personal information from anyone under the age of 18;
Promotes any criminal activity or enterprise;
Solicits passwords or personal identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes from other Users;
Involves commercial activities or sales or contests or advertising, without WWE's prior written consent;
Includes a photograph or video of another person that you have posted without that person's consent
Imitates or purports to be a posting to a WWE Website by someone other than the person actually posting.
B. Report Inappropriate Content
Help WWE remove content that doesn't belong here.  If you become aware of misuse of a WWE Website by any person, you agree to click on the "Contact WWE" or the "Report Abuse" links.
After the WWE fan community identifies questionable content through this website reporting tool, the content will be automatically reviewed, and WWE may exercise its discretion to either further review or permanently remove the offending content or conduct and to warn or, as appropriate, to bar from being Registered Fans those transmitting such content or engaging in such conduct.
We need all Users to report suspicious persons and inappropriate content they encounter on any part of a WWE Website. And we strongly encourage Users under the age of 18 to talk to their parents or a responsible adult immediately if someone online says or does something to make them feel uncomfortable or threatened in any way.
C. Keep your Guard Up!
You agree to choose carefully the User-Generated Content you post on or through the Services and that you provide to other Users.  Although the Services may not include any form of Prohibited Content, as defined in Section A, some information, materials, products or services submitted to the Services by other Fans may, in whole or in part, be unauthorized, impermissible or otherwise violate these Terms of Use, and WWE assumes no responsibility or liability for such material.
Remember that although the use of screen names by Fans is not a violation of the Terms of Use, people are not always who they say they are. You should always be careful when communicating with people you do not know in the real world. And it is always risky to meet anyone in person whom you don't know through real world friends.
Be cautious about posting and sharing personal information, especially information that could be used to identify you or locate you offline, such as your address or telephone number.
You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Fans.  WWE reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and other Fans.
WWE cannot guarantee that any Participation or User-Generated Content on WWE Websites was actually created by the individual or entity claiming authorship.
D. Abide by All Laws
You agree to use the Services, including all features and functionalities associated therewith, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or other restrictions on use of the service or content therein. Except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use, you agree not to archive, download (other than through caching necessary for personal use), reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use content and information contained on or obtained from or through the Services without express written permission from WWE and its licensors.

You indemnify the Indemnified Parties (defined above) from and against any costs, losses, damages or expenses the Indemnified Parties incur in any way relating to a claim from a third party that your User-Generated Content infringes or violates the rights (including any intellectual property rights) of a third party.
WWE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason to reject, refuse to post or remove any User-Generated Content (including private messages) or to deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of any Services, including the WWE Website, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability.  WWE expressly reserves the right to remove profiles from the Services and/or deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to any Services, including the WWE Website, if WWE determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms of Use or pose a threat to WWE and/or its fans.
WWE assumes no responsibility for monitoring WWE Websites Participation for inappropriate User-Generated Content or conduct.

Illegal and/or unauthorized use of any Service, including collecting usernames, and/or email addresses of fans by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email or unauthorized framing of or linking to any Service, including any WWE Website, or employing third party promotional sites or software to promote a profile or posting on any Service for money, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of unauthorized solicitation may be removed from any Service including WWE.com without notice or explanation and may result in termination of registration.  WWE reserves the right to take appropriate legal action for any illegal or unauthorized use of WWE.com, any other WWE Website or any of the other Services.
You are solely responsible for the photos, messages, notes, text, information, music, video and other content that you upload, publish or display (hereinafter, "post") to any Service including WWE.com, or transmit to or share with other users. You may not post, transmit, or share content that you did not create or that you do not have permission to post.

Jurisdictional Issues
The Services are controlled and operated by or on behalf of WWE and its affiliates. We make no representation that materials or products offered on the Services are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. Those who choose to access the Services do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable national and local laws. Software and products downloaded or purchased from the Services are further subject to United States export controls. No software or products offered on the Services may be downloaded, shipped or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria, or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By purchasing products or downloading or using the Software offered on the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.
Termination
We may terminate your access to the Services immediately and without notice if in our sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Use or any other term or condition of use posted on the Services. Upon termination of your use of the Services, you must cease use of the Services and destroy all materials obtained from the Services and all copies of such materials.
WWE may terminate your status as a Registered Fan, delete any WWE.com participation or any posting to any WWE Website or other Service at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, without liability, and these Terms of Use will remain in effect. If you have any problems with the Services or your use of the Services or with these Terms of Use, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Services.
In addition, for Month-to-Month Recurring Subscriptions, in addition to our rights to terminate your subscription in the circumstances set out above, we may also cancel your subscription by notice to you at any time (without cause and without liability) provided that any such termination shall not take effect until the end of the then current subscription month (and we will not take any payment from you in respect of the subsequent month (or thereafter)).
WWE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS IN UK, IRELAND AND NEW ZEALAND ONLY: If you are a subscriber to the WWE Network in the UK, Ireland or New Zealand, the above Termination provisions still apply to you in full, save only that, in respect of your subscription to the WWE Network, the second paragraph above (the paragraph beginning “WWE may terminate your status as a Registered Fan…") does not apply to you.
Arbitration of Disputes; Class Action Waiver
These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut and are subject to applicable copyright and intellectual property laws, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions.
With respect to any and all disputes and claims arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or the Services (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), WWE and you agree to negotiate in good faith to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.  If you and WWE do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted by binding arbitration under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration laws, except as provided in this section.
The arbitration will be done by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.  The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of filing, arbitrator, and administration fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.  We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than US$10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In addition, WWE will not seek attorney’s fees and costs in arbitration unless it is determined by the arbitrator that the claims are frivolous.
If your claim is worth US$10,000 or less, We agree that You may choose whether arbitration will be conducted by written submissions, telephone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.  If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules.  Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.
Compared to lawsuits in court, arbitration is less formal.  In arbitration, a neutral arbitrator is used instead of a judge or jury, and court review of the arbitration award is limited.  An arbitrator has the ability to award the same relief and damages as a court.
As the sole exception to this arbitration requirement, a User may pursue a claim in small claims court provided such claim is within that court’s jurisdiction and provided that the User proceeds only on an individual basis.
If You choose to commence arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send a written notice to WWE by certified mail requesting arbitration or a small claim court action and describing your claim (“Notice”).  Regardless of which party sends the Notice, it should describe the basis of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought.  This letter must be addressed to: General Counsel, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., 1241 E. Main Street, Stamford, CT 06902.  If WWE initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address of the User used for access to the Services.  If You and WWE do not reach an agreed upon resolution within 30 days of receiving notice, You or WWE have the right to begin an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.  A form Notice to initiate arbitration can be copied or downloaded at www.adr.org.
For timeliness purposes, You and WWE agree to begin any arbitration or claim in small claims court within one year after a claim arises; otherwise, the claim is waived.
You and WWE also agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor the WWE will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. We both also expressly waive the right to a trial by jury.
To the extent arbitration is not applicable, You and WWE agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts (as applicable) located in Fairfield County of the State of Connecticut.  You agree that WWE may bring suit in a court of competent jurisdiction in Connecticut to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
General Provisions
If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of the Services.  The failure of WWE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.  The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act / Copyright Infringement
If you believe your work has been copied and posted on or through these Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send WWE's Copyright Agent a notification of claimed infringement with all of the following information:
(a) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
(b) identification of the claimed infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (providing the URL(s) of the claimed infringing material satisfies this requirement);
(c) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address;
(d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
(e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and
(f) your physical or electronic signature.
We have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of Fans who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access to the Services and/or terminate Memberships of any Users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
WWE's Copyright Agent for notification of claimed infringement can be reached as follows: Copyright Agent, World Wrestling Entertainment, 1241 East Main Street, Stamford, CT 06902.  WWE's Copyright Agent for notification of claimed infringement can also be reached electronically by clicking cpagent@wwe.com
