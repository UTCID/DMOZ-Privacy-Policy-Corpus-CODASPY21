IX. GOVERNING LAW
The Terms & Conditions and any separate agreements whereby we provide you the Services shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without reference to any conflict of law rules.
You agree that you will not use the Services in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws, restrictions or regulations.
X. ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
A. Arbitration Notice: You and the Bills agree that if there is any dispute or claim arising from or related to our Services, these Terms & Conditions, and/or the Privacy Policy it will be resolved by confidential binding arbitration in Buffalo, New York, rather than in court, after first giving Notice of the Dispute ("Notice") to the other party and the opportunity to discuss resolution within thirty (30) days of such Notice. The Notice to the Company should be sent to: Bills, One Bills Drive, Orchard Park, New York 14127, Attn: Legal Department. This Notice must include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting, and the relief sought.
If you and the Bills are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within thirty (30) days after the Notice is sent, you or the Company may initiate arbitration proceedings. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the provisions of these Terms & Conditions as a court would. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
The arbitration shall be held in Buffalo, New York or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be confidential, final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms & Conditions to the contrary, you and us agree that if we make any change to this Section (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Section, any such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of the Terms & Conditions containing this Section is posted to the Services, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of termination.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. *If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, *we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or the Company may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
B. Claims and Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year
To the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any disclaimer contained herein, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to your use of the Services, including, without limitation, any website or mobile application or other Services-related product, services, or other content must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. This section applies to you and your heirs, successors and assigns.
XI. SEVERABILITY
To the extent that any provision of these Terms & Conditions is deemed to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, including the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms & Conditions. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
XII. TERMINATION
These Terms & Conditions are effective until terminated. We may terminate this agreement at any time without notice to you and may deny you access to our Services.
XIII. INDEMNIFICATION
To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except to the extent arising from our gross negligence or intentional misconduct, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, and our employees, contractors, licensors, service providers, affiliates, subcontractors, suppliers, and representatives, from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms & Conditions or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or rights of a third party. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you shall cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses. You shall not settle any actions or claims on our behalf without our prior written consent.
If you are a California resident or resident of a state with a similar applicable law, you hereby expressly waive California Civil Code section 1542 in connection with the foregoing (or such other similar applicable law in your state), which states: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."
XIV. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES
There are no third party beneficiaries to the Terms & Conditions. We shall have the right to assign our rights or delegate any of its responsibilities under these Terms & Conditions to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or reorganization for the sale of substantially all of our assets.
XV. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS
We reserve the right to change, modify, or amend these Terms & Conditions at any time to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Terms & Conditions, such changes will be effective upon posting. It is your obligation to check our current Terms & Conditions for any changes. These Terms & Conditions may only be modified in writing. Any ambiguities in the interpretation will not be construed against the drafter.
