Data retention period
We will hold information about you in our data systems only for as long as we need it for the purpose for which we collected it, which is as follows:
As long as you continue to log into our website or use our services (including engaging with emails, entering cycling events or downloading content) we will retain and process information about you.   In such cases, you will be considered to be an ‘active’ customer.  If you have not been ‘active’ as a customer for a period of three years, CTT will deactivate your customer account and subject to the data retention periods referred to below anonymise any personal data relating to you.
