Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Analytics
We use Google Analytics on our website in order to compile statistics on how our website is being used, which can help us to improve our website and online services. We anonymise all IP addresses gathered through this service so your IP address cannot be linked directly to your personal information.
Who we share your data with
We may have to share your personal information with other businesses and / or suppliers in order to provide you with products/services you have requested/ordered.
Where you have given us permission to contact you, we may pass on your information to external service providers to contact you on our behalf.
We may need to share your personal information with our search engine providers so they can assist with the improvement of our website.
If another party wants to invest in us or we are taken over by another party, we may need to share your personal information with them.

How long we retain your data
Any contact form entries we receive are deleted after 6 months. Our analytics records are automatically deleted after 26 months, or when you request their deletion. We keep customer purchase records for 8 years.
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

Where we send your data
The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored, at a location outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
