Tax Receipting Policy
Maccabi Canada is a Registered Canadian Amateur Athletic Association and can issue official donation receipts and receive gifts from other charitable organizations.
Maccabi Canada’s registration number is: 140092321RR0001 or click on here.
Part I. General Tax Receipts Information
Tax receipts will be issued for donations of $18 and above.
On-line Donations: Tax receipts for donations made online are issued immediately in the form of a PDF file and are emailed to the e-mail address provided by the donor.
Cheque Donations: Tax receipts for donations made by cheque or cash are issued within 10 business days of the time received in the Maccabi Canada head office, and will be emailed to the donor in the form of a PDF file.  Tax receipts for donations made by cheques are issued for the year in which they were received in our office.  Donations received after January 1st cannot be added to the previous year.
Cumulative Donations: Cumulative tax receipts are issued for cash or monthly donations at the end of the year.
See below for information on tax receipts for gift-in-kind and events.
Maccabi Canada will issue a tax receipt in the name of the individual or company that made the donation. Maccabi Canada will only issue an official tax receipt in the name of the true donor. Maccabi Canada reserves the right to refuse issuing a tax receipt under a name that is different than the person/organization named in the transaction.
In a case where a person or an organization is acting as a donation collector, the tax receipt will be issued to those whose property is being donated. In such a case, the intermediary must provide the following information:
Donor’s first and last name
Donor’s full address
Donor’s phone number
Donor’s email
Donor’s signature
Donation amount
If a donation is made by a cheque that has two names on it, Maccabi Canada will issued a tax receipt with either or  both names. For example, a cheque is written on a joint account held by spouses.
In a situation where the donor asks to issue a tax receipt in another name and there is no clear evidence as to the true donor, Maccabi Canada may ask for a written statement from a person providing the donation as to the identity of the true donor.
Gifts-In-Kind and Fair Market Value
Tax receipts for gift-in-kind are issued separately for each gift.
Gift-in-kind is a gift of property. The tax receipt amount is the fair market value of the donated property.
Fair market value (FMV) is the highest dollar value that a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept in an open and unrestricted market where both buyer and seller are knowledgeable, informed, and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other.
If the estimated market value of a property is more than $1,000, an independent professional appraisal must be done by a third party at the donor’s expense. Gifts with estimated value of under $1,000 can be evaluated by a member of Maccabi Canada or another individual who has sufficient knowledge of the property. In both cases, the name and address of the appraiser must be provided to Maccabi Canada and included on the tax receipt.
Deemed Market Value
If a donor purchased a gift less than three years before donating it to Maccabi Canada, the value for tax receipt purposes would be the price paid by the donor for that property. For example, if a donor purchased a property for $500 and one year later donates that property to Maccabi Canada, the tax receipt will be issued for $500 even if the current FMV is $800 dollars.
Note: According to CRA, if a donor fails to disclose the fact that a gift is subject to the deemed market value rule, and receives a tax receipt for an amount higher than the purchase price, the value of that gift could be reduced to nil.
If the fair market value cannot be determined, Maccabi Canada will not issue a tax receipt.
Replacing Lost Charitable Tax Receipts
1. The donor/recipient must provide a letter to Maccabi Canada detailing:
a. The amount and date of the contribution
b. Proof of payment
c. Circumstances of how the receipt was lost
2. The recipient must acknowledge in writing on the prescribed form that should the original receipt be found it will be returned to Maccabi Canada.
3. On the completion of the above, a duplicate receipt will be issued and marked DUPLICATE.
Correcting Tax Receipts
If tax receipt issued by Maccabi Canada contains incorrect information, a new corrected tax receipt can be issued.
The donor is required to send a written request to Maccabi Canada detailing:
1. What information printed on the tax receipt is incorrect.
2. What information should be printed on the tax receipt.
If a new corrected tax receipt is issued, the previously issued incorrect receipt becomes void and invalid.
Note: Changing a donor’s name will require proof as to who the true donor is. If the donor would like to change the address on the tax receipt, a copy of a valid picture ID will be required.
Part II. Information for Tax Receipting Events
Tax receipts for donations made at an event are issued as per part II of this document for the eligible amount.
In order to protect its eligibility for issuing official donation receipts, Maccabi Canada is committed to following all rules and regulations regarding tax receipting set out by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).  If a tax receipt for your participants is a key factor in the likely success of your event, then please review our tax receipting policy carefully before making any final decisions regarding your event.
The event coordinator is responsible for informing all event participants about Maccabi Canada’s Tax Receipt Policy.  Please do not hesitate to contact us for additional information.
Maccabi Canada can issue an acknowledgement letter as a proof of payment to sponsors who wish to claim their contribution as a business expense, and not as charitable donation, in which case, no official donation receipts will be issued.
Tax receipts are issued for donation amounts of $18 or greater. Part I of this document provides guidelines regarding the name on a tax receipt.
In case where a person or a company has acted as a donation collector and is issuing a cumulative cheque to Maccabi Canada, a detailed list of donor information must be provided with the payment.
The provided list must include the following information:
Donor’s first and last name
Donor’s full address
Donor’s phone number
Donor’s email
List and values of benefits received by the donor (the list of benefits is shown later in this section)
Amount to be included on the charitable tax receipt
Maccabi Canada has to receive this information within 30 calendar days of the event.
Tax receipts will be issued within 15 business days of the package being received at the Maccabi Canada head office.
Auctions and Raffles Paperwork
Please submit a list (Excel file is preferred) with the following information:
Donor’s first and last name, full address, phone number, and email address
Gift description and gift value (including pictures of the gifts)
Please indicate whether the item was used for a raffle or an auction and the value for which it was auctioned.
Please indicate the name of the donor of each item
Maccabi Canada has to receive this information within 30 calendar days of the event.
Tax receipts will be issued within 15 business days of the package being received at the Maccabi Canada head office.
Auction purchases and payments
All sales are final and items are sold as-is. Please allow 30 minutes after bidding has been closed before checking in to the auction cashier. Payments can be made by Visa, Master Card, cash, or cheque made payable to Maccabi Canada.  Winners must pay in full and collect their acquisitions on the night of the auction.
Alternate arrangements can be made and auction items can be picked up from a designated location within 24 hours. Please refer to the auction desk for details. After 24-hour period, items will become property of Maccabi Canada and no refunds will be issued.
If the last bidder fails to report to the cashier for payment, the items will be offered to the next bidder.
Maccabi Canada reserves the right to add or withdraw items to or from the auction without notice.
Tax Receipts for Items Donated for an Auction or Raffle
Tax receipt amount is equal to the auction proceeds (highest bid), which is considered as fair market value.
If a holder donates a gift certificate that was originally acquired for consideration, he/she can receive an official donation receipt for the value shown on the certificate.
When the issuer donates a gift certificate to Maccabi Canada for a silent auction, the redemption of that gift certificate by a 3rd party (whoever purchased that certificate) does not entitle the issuer to a tax receipt.
The issuer cannot be the holder.
Contributions that are not Donations
Tax receipts are not issued for items purchased at an auction. Such a transaction is considered a purchase, and not a donation.
Partial tax receipt for an event participation fee will be issued if the ticket price or admission fee was greater than the benefit received. The difference between the participation price and the benefit must be at least 18 dollars.
In the view of CRA “no part of the cost of a lottery ticket is a gift.” Therefore, the amount paid to purchase a lottery ticket is not eligible for a tax receipt. Maccabi Canada applies the same rule for raffle tickets.
Tax receipts are not issued for donated services
Tax receipts are not issued for a purchase of an advertisement
What are the Benefits?
Dinner – FMV of a fundraising dinner is the value of a comparable meal provided by a comparable facility. If the event is at a restaurant, then the price is what a regular customer would pay. An exception can be made if group or banquet rates were applied.
Entertainment (shows, concerts, guest speakers, sporting events, and theatre) – A tax receipt can be issued for the difference between the actual ticket price and the usual and current ticket price. If the usual and current ticket price cannot be determined, then no portion of the ticket price will be eligible for tax receipting.
Door and achievement prizes – the total retail value of all door prizes is allocated pro rata to all attendees
Green fees paid by non-members at a golf club. However, if participant is a member of that golf club and does not have to pay for the round, the green fee will not be deducted from the entry fee to arrive at the tax receipt amount.
Cart rental – regular rental cost used
Meals at a golf club  – the value of a meal that would be charged if it was purchased separately at the course
Complimentary items – the value is a price that would have to be paid to acquire the item in a retail store
Hole in one prizes are not considered as benefits. In CRA’s view “for any particular participant the value of the chance to win the prize is nominal.”
Any other goods or services received by the event
Note: Even if the benefits were provided for free or a sponsor has paid to cover the costs of the event, the fair market value will still be deducted.
Part III. Tax Receipts for The Games.
1st party donors will receive a tax receipt for the non-benefited portion of their donation after the games.   Game specific information including the amount of the eligible portion will become available prior to each set of Games.
3rd party donors will receive an immediate tax receipt for a hundred percent of the amount donated.
What is the definition of a 1st party and 3rd party donor?
A 1st party donor in relation to the athlete* is defined as one of the following:
athlete themselves
spouse
child
parent
sibling of an athlete
sibling’s spouse
grandparent
grandchild
another athlete
spouse of another athlete
child of another athlete
parent of another athlete

grandchild of another athlete
spouse of any of the above
business or corporation owned/controlled by any of the above
3rd party donors are those not listed above
*means the athlete is registered to participate in any of the Maccabi Games.
Donation Swapping
Paying for a team member while they reciprocate payment (or donation “swapping”) is not considered a 3rd party donation.  A tax receipt should not be produced when a payment is exchanged between athletes or when a donation is reciprocated by return donation.  A donation receipt will be issued for a true “gift” from one athlete to another.  Donations will be denied when exchanged with:
another athlete
parent of another athlete
grandparent of another athlete
sibling or sibling-in-law of another athlete
spouse of another athlete
