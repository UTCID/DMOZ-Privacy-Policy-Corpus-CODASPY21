GDPR - Your privacy is important to us
Your privacy is important to us
By now you are undoubtedly aware that on the 25th of May 2018 the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect. Keeping your personal data safe has always been at the forefront for us and this remains unchanged. However, we have changed our privacy policy in line with the new EU regulations.
You are in complete control of what you receive and can change your communication preferences at any time. To make changes in the future, simply visit  the Club website and update your preferences in the Members' Area. The website registration process automatically disables the publication of your contact details. We encourage all members to update their profile so that members can contact each other, by email and phone.
