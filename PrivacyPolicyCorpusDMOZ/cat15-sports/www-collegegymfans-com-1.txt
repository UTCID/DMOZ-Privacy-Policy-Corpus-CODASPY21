The Recruitables Database:  Submitting, Editing and Claiming Ownership of Entries
The Recruitables section is anchored by a searchable database of potential student athletes. There are also sections for Commits and Newcomers, which are separately maintained from the database.
Before Getting Started
Please read the important information on the database policies before continuing.  Submissions to the database are voluntary.   The database is intended for use by fans of the sport and other site visitors, and is no way affiliated with the NCAA.  All listings are optionals.  All site users agree to the site policies, terms of use, privacy policy, and the special policies with regard to the database.
Registration
Anyone can submit a new entry for consideration or offer additional information up on an existing entry.  However, only athletes, parents, recruiting services or club coaches can own an entry and make edits on their own.  To do so, you must first register a user account with the site and log into your account.  Site registration is required in order to maintain password access to your entry.  By doing so, you agree to the site terms of use, the privacy policy, and have read the special policies on the database.
