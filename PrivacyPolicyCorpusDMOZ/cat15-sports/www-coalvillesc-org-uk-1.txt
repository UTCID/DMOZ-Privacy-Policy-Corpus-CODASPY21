particular for the following reasons:
Internal record keeping.
We may use the information to improve our products and services.

How we use cookies
We sometimes place small data files on your computer. These are known as cookies. Most websites do this.
They improve things by:
remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page
measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs
These cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just here to make the site work better for you.
Indeed, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish. We do not store any personal information
in the cookies - nor do we place any cookies relating to advertising on the website.
To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit
AboutCookies.org. Or please read on to find out
more about how and where we use cookies.
Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)
We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do
this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better.
Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got
here and what you click on. We do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or
address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. We do not allow Google to use or
share our analytics data with third parties.
You
can get more information on the cookies that Google Analytics stores in your browser at this
link.
Highlighting menus and logging onto the website
If you log into this website (to administer the content, comment on a blog, carry out
a purchase etc) then we store any details that we need to on our server. To link your "session"
data on our server with your browser session a small cookie is placed in your browser - containing an
anonymised link to the session. As soon as you close your broswer this session cookie is deleted.
Remembering whether you've seen the school pop-up alerts
When we alert you to an important issue (school closed due to snow etc) - we don't want that alert
popping up on EVERY page you visit. It would be annoying! So we check that you've seen it once and then
store a cookie - so you only see it once per browsing session.
We determine that both these types of cookies are essential to the running of the
website.
Links to other websites
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to
leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we
cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting
such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look
at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional
