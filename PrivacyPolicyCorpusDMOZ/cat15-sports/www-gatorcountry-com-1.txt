Transferring Personal Data from the EU to the US
Gator Country has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). With respect to collection of personal data of individuals in the European Union governed by the GDPR, Gator Country relies on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR.  Gator Country collects in the U.S. personal data with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Gator Country in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Gator Country endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only as consistent with your relationship with Gator Country and the practices described in this privacy policy.
Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on the Website home page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you by email to the primary email address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the Website home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes. Gator Country Multimedia, Inc. reserves the right to update this policy at any time.
