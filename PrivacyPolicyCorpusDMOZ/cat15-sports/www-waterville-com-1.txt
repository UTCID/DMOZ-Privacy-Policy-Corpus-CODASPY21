Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Waterville Valley, one of its subsidiaries or substantially all of were acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.

This includes our right to exchange information with other organizations in order to protect against fraud and to reduce credit risk. Waterville Valley also reserves the right to disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.Links to other web sites; "Public" AreasPlease be aware that when you are using the Sites, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites that take you outside our Sites. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information on a "public" venue online (for example via bulletin board, chat rooms or chat groups), that information can be collected and used by people you do not know. If you chose to voluntarily disclose information on a bulletin board, chat room or other public venue on these other sites, this privacy policy will not cover such disclosure of information. We urge you to use caution when disclosing any personal information on these venues.CookiesWaterville Valley uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you for various purposes including optimizing your Site experience. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All areas on the Sites where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. We use cookies to ensure you obtain the information you request. The cookie(s) we pass to you are anonymous. They do not reveal your personal identity, nor can they capture private data. Rather, these cookies establish a user session and allow our server to correctly provide the users with the appropriate frames and content.We track the usage of our Sites and other Media Products in order to modify our Sites and Media Products according to our customers' needs. We pay attention to what information is requested and attempt to make it easier to find in the future. With respect to our Sites, you always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

However, please be aware that some features of the Sites may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from third parties with links on the Sites. Waterville Valley does not control these cookies. The use of cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.IP AddressesAn IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the big computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Waterville Valley collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track the use of the Sites. When visitors request pages from the Sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Sites' policies or to protect our service or customers, the Sites, or others.This policy applies only to information collected on the InternetThis privacy policy applies only to information collected on our Sites. It does not apply to information which we may collect by means other than over the Internet and it does not apply to businesses which may use our Sites.The Organizations that Collect InformationWaterville Valley, one of its resorts (the website addresses of which are listed above) or a third party partner may be collecting information during your experience with our Sites.Security ProceduresSecurity procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control.Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. Therefore, we have taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. We maintain your profile information on a secure server. To use some features on the Media Products, we may require that you create a password. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. In addition, when you transmit personal information from your PC to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Waterville Valley strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.Children's PrivacyThe Sites are general audience web sites that comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Children under 13 are only permitted to submit information to Waterville Valley in certain limited circumstances. Any personal information that may be provided to the Sites from children under 13 years old will be collected and maintained in accordance with COPPA. While we encourage parents to supervise their children's online activities, we recognize that parents may not always be able to do so. Therefore, in addition to the foregoing provisions of this privacy policy, Waterville Valley has adopted the following special policies to help ensure that parents will be able to know what information their children under 13 are providing to the Sites.Collection and Use of Information; Parental Notice/ConsentIn accordance with COPPA, Waterville Valley does not require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.We may collect a child's e-mail address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or a question e-mailed to us by the child for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (for example, to contact the winner of a contest or respond to a question). We will not use this information to recontact the child and we will delete it from our records once the game or contest is over. We will obtain written parental consent before sending any prizes to contest winners or posting any information about any winners on the Sites.We may collect a child's e-mail address and first name in order to respond directly to a specific request from the child more than once. For example, a child may want to receive a newsletter or other online communications about new features on the Sites or participate in a contest that involves more than a one-time contact. When a child submits such a request, we will obtain an e-mail address for the child's parent(s) along with the child's information. Before we make any additional response to the child's request, after our initial response, we will send an e-mail to the child's parent(s) that notifies the parent(s) that we have collected personal information from the child for the purpose of responding to the child's particular request and describes the personal information collected from the child, gives the parent(s) the opportunity to deny us permission to send any further responses to the child and to request that we delete the information we have collected from our records, and provides the parent(s) with a link to access this privacy policy.We may collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of the Sites, to protect against liability, or as required or permitted by law without obtaining a parent's consent. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose. Prior to any other collection or use of personal information from a child under 13, Waterville Valley shall obtain a parent's consent to such collection and use in accordance with COPPA. The parental consent is given for the specific purpose stated in the consent form and is not a blanket consent for collecting the child's information in the future or using the child's information for purposes other than those set forth in the consent form. We may seek a parent's consent to collect information such as a child's name, mailing address, e-mail address, hobbies, etc.Sharing of InformationThe personal information collected from children under the age of 13 is not shared or forwarded by Waterville Valley to business partners, advertisers or other third parties.Parental AccessParents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records at any time. If you would like to review or delete your child's personal information, please contact us via email at privacy@waterville.com. When a parent requests deletion of his or her child's information, we will use reasonable efforts to delete as much of the child's information from our database as possible and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from such child. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
