monitor and develop participation in the sport of Triathlon by monitoring members’ engagement and participation through events and membership and inviting our members to participate in surveys for researching and development purposes;

we have made the decision not to send any marketing communications to any junior members under the age of 16.

We will only communicate with any junior members under the age of 16 if they have applied to race in one of our British Triathlon organised events including but not limited to Youth and Junior Super Series events and will need to receive information on this event (such as whether they have been selected to participate or not), or if it directly relates to essential membership services as stated in ‘Why we need your personal information – contractual purposes’.

For example, we use a third party provider, MailChimp, to deliver some of our email communications which might include e-newsletters and direct marketing emails.
