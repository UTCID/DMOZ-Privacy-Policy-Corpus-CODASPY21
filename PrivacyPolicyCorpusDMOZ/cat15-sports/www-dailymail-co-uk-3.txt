The longer Manny Pacquiao delays confirming his next opponent – and he is now talking about an announcement in late December – the more the boxing undergrowth stirs with murmurs of a rematch with Floyd Mayweather.For Amir Khan, the wait goes on.As this column accurately reported last week, Khan sent his written acceptance of Pacquiao's terms to promoter Bob Arum 10 days ago and has been expecting a contract in return.
Amir Khan is being made to wait by Manny Pacquiao, who could confirm his next opponent in December
Khan pictured with promoter Eddie Hearn (right) before the Callum Smith vs Rocky Fielding fight on SaturdayMy article did not say Khan had signed a final contract, even though that was the agitated claim of a couple of my fellow hacks in America who believe they have a divine right to be first with every story, rarely though they get one.For their information Shah Khan, Amir's father and mentor, now says: 'The story was correct and we are awaiting receipt of the contract.'

The Khans recognise that Arum may also have talked turkey with a couple of his in-house fighters at Top Rank promotions – rising starlet Terence Crawford and Tim Bradley, who has re-established himself after comprehensively losing a rematch of his own with Pacquiao after being given a dubious decision first time out.But they did not envisage the PacMan keeping them waiting until Christmas.Now, in addition to Arum dispatching to Pacquiao tapes of Khan and Crawford in action and of Bradley's weekend knockout of Brandon Rios, there is a nagging suspicion that the PacMan may be giving Mayweather a respectable time frame in which to perform another U-turn out of retirement.Even as Bradley was staking his claim on Saturday in Las Vegas, Pacquiao was attending a charity event in Abu Dhabi where he insisted that he is in negotiation with Mayweather and told CNN: 'It's very much possible. I would love a re-match if he wants it. Of course we hear from him very often that he has retired but that's not new from him.'
Khan has been putting in the lengths and posted a video of his late-night swim on Instagram on Tuesday
Pacquiao is set to retire from boxing after one more fight to concentrate on his political career
Khan has not fought since he beat Chris Algieri on points in New York City in May 2015
Pacquiao was last in action against Floyd Mayweather who beat him comprehensively at the MGM GrandThen he added that he hoped to announce his opponent for what could be his own farewell fight 'late next month'.While that may be frustrating for the candidates bidding to occupy the opposite corner to Pacquaio in the spring, the timing could not better for the British author of the first biography of Mayweather's life to be published.As well as the boxing grapevine rustling, so do the pages inside the cover of Money, by our esteemed colleague Tris Dixon, who brilliantly revived Boxing News before leaving that editorship to become part of the Sky Sports team.Dixon's exhaustively researched book, which hits the shelves on November 28, ends by fanning the rematch flames: 'Pacquiao is still the man that would make Mayweather more for one last fight than any other. A second fight could take place in the summer of 2016 in the new MGM arena (in Las Vegas). Mayweather maintains he will not fight again… (but) we have heard that before.'We have indeed, twice before.Dixon also astutely observes: 'With the Pacquiao camp citing injury for defeat (in their first fight)…..the sales pitch has begun.'That it has.
The longer Pacquiao delays confirming his next opponent the more there is talk of a Mayweather rematch
There is a suspicion that Pacquiao may be giving Mayweather time to perform a U-turn out of retirement
A potential rematch between Pacquiao and Mayweather would still generate handsome pay-TV salesHall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach now admits regretting his failure to pull the PacMan out of the richest fight in ring history and repeatedly asserts that the result would have been different but for the shoulder injury which needed surgery immediately thereafter.A need to refute that suggestion would give Mayweather a platform to justify returning for the 50th bout of his career, which would carry him past the record of 49 wins en route to retirement as a world champion which he currently shares with Rocky Marciano.That would also refresh public interest after the disappointment of the first fight. While the rematch would be most unlikely to hit the same half-billion-dollar heights, it should generate enough pay-TV sales for Mayweather again to bank in excess of a hundred million bucks.And while Arum accepts for practical purposes that Mayweather means it when he says he is never coming back, his PacMan would stand to collect close to that eye-watering amount.There would be a scheduling difficulty to overcome.Mayweather has long preferred May for a spring fight and that would coincide with the opening of the new MGM Arena.
Khan sent his written acceptance of Pacquiao's terms to promoter Bob Arum (pictured) 10 days ago
Arum (from left to right), Pacquiao and trainer Freddie Roach pictured together in Las Vegas in 2009Pacquiao, already a Filipino congressman, is standing for election to his country's senate in May so ideally would like his 'retirement' fight no later than April 9.However, another fitter and better mega-fight with Mayweather could itself be a powerful campaign tool for this national hero.Furthermore, Roach is predicting that an impressive performance by Pacquiao in April could increase the temptation for Mayweather to make a one-off comeback in his other regular fight month, September.And who better for Pacquiao to make that statement against than Khan, who Mayweather pulled out of fighting three times?The PacMan teases us by hinting he will make that decision on or after his 37th birthday on December 17. If so, then hopefully it will be Happy Christmas, Amir.
British boxer Khan has been expecting a contract after agreeing to Pacquiao's terms recentlyMoney, The Life and Fast Times of Floyd Mayweather, by Tris Dixon, publishing November 28, Arena Sport, £16.99 hardback.  Carl Froch always wanted to compete in Las Vegas and the chance is likely to come now, albeit not in the prize-ring despite his mischievous hints that he may make a boxing comeback to challenge James DeGale for one of his old world super-middleweight titles.The Nottingham Cobra with the heavy fists is also a dab hand at cards and has been known to visit the casinos on that fabled Strip.Now that he has been appointed as an ambassador for partypoker.com we can expect Froch to feature in some big Texas Holdem tournaments in Vegas.

Froch always wanted to compete in Las Vegas and the chance is likely to finally arrive - in pokerMeanwhile Froch, who has stayed in fighting trim since knocking out George Groves in that 80,000 Wembley spectacular 18 months ago, insists it would not be gamble if he did come out of retirement to fight DeGale.'Easy work,' he says of his fellow Englishman who, on November 28 in Montreal against Lucien Bute, defends the IBF belt he claimed with victory over Andre Dirrell in Boston this May.But if DeGale sees off the Canada-based Romanian he will have his sights set on a unification match with WBC champion Badou Jack, against whom George Groves failed in his third world title bid this September.And waiting in the wings now for a shot at any of the alpha-belt champions is Liverpool's Callum Smith, who made history on Saturday night by completing a full set of four brothers all holding British titles.Callum's spectacular first-round demolition of Merseyside rival Rocky Fielding strengthened the belief that this powerful young man is the most potent of all the Smith family's fighting siblings – and will become a threat next year to anyone in the talent-rich 12-stone division.
