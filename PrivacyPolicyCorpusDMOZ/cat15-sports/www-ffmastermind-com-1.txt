This policy is not only reachable from our homepage, but also on each page where personally identifiable information may be requested.

The Methods in Which FF Mastermind Uses Information
FF Mastermind uses the information a patron provides about himself/herself or other parties when placing an order only to complete that order. FF Mastermind does not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that specific order.
FF Mastermind uses return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
Patrons can sign up on our website to receive updates on upgrades to the FF Mastermind website as well as valuable fantasy football information regarding both free and premium services. Information submitted on the FF Mastermind website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.
FF Mastermind uses non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, FF Mastermind may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but FF Mastermind would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, FF Mastermind never uses or shares the personally identifiable information provided to us on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
FF Mastermind's Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, FF Mastermind has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information FF Mastermind collects on-line.
FF Mastermind's Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to FF Mastermind. For that reason, FF Mastermind never collects or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13. No portion of the FF Mastermind website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.
Correcting Your Information
Patrons can correct factual errors in their personally identifiable information at FF Mastermind by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
To protect the privacy and security of patrons, FF Mastermind will also take reasonable steps to verify the patron's identity before granting access or making corrections.
