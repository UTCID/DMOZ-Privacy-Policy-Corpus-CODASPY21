What is LEO during the COVID 19 Pandemic?
Lambton Elderly Outreach (LEO) is celebrating its 50th Anniversary this year as a not-for-profit who provides services to seniors and adults with disabilities in order to assist them maintain their independence such as Transportation, Personal Care and Support, Meals on Wheels, Housing Support, Crisis Intervention (Social Workers) among others.
When the Covid-19 Pandemic struck globally, LEO quickly made a decision to continue to provide essential services to our clients, when many other organizations chose to suspend services.  In fact, Leo was the only not-for-profit organization who provides transportation to clients who are Covid suspect or Covid positive.
The relationship and partnership with the Sarnia Sting began several years ago through Chuck-A -Puck fundraisers and we are very excited to continue to grow this partnership with a “Puck Covid” t-shirt featuring the Sarnia Sting logo.
LEO is very appreciative of the proceeds from the sale of these t-shirts which LEO will use to continue to protect our vulnerable clients which they receive much needed services such as personal care, or essential transportation to dialysis, cancer treatments or to and from the hospital and Retirement Homes.  The proceeds will assist LEO in paying for much needed and increasingly expensive personal protective equipment (PPE), to which the price has increased over 1800% since before the Pandemic.  LEO is also installing protective barriers between our clients and the drivers in our accessible vehicles.
