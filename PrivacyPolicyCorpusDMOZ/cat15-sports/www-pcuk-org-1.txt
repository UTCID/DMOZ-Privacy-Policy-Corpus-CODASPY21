Every organisation which holds data is required to register with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). When registering the organisation must specify the type of data they will hold and about whom, the purpose for which they are holding it and who will have access or might be able to see all or a subset of the data.
The Pony Club have registered with the ICO to comply with the above statement. Branches are covered by this registration too, and must comply with the legislation by making sure the data collected is kept safe and secure and only used as needed.
When collecting Member data, it is important that to comply with the legislation Branches must record their member details on the Unity database. This way the information is kept secure to the standards expected by the ICO.
