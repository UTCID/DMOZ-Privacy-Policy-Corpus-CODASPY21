Supplements are substances that come in different forms like capsules, gel tabs, liquids, extracts, or pills. They are often added to food or drinks to help lower one’s risk of different health problems. Vitamins, on the other hand, are also substances that come in different types (Vitamins A, B, C, D, amongst others) to help the body grow and develop normally. It is worthy to note that these vitamins can also come in the form of supplements, especially when one is not privy to eating more natural and nutritious foods with Vitamins.
While some of these supplements are safe to take as long as one follows the instructions, it is still necessary to look out for signs or symptoms of risks that could lead to defects or eventual death. Therefore, it would be best to read more about what consumers have to say about vitamins and supplements before buying or using them.
Both Vitamins and Supplements contribute significantly to the development and growth of humans. It is safe to refer to them as the fuel that keeps the fire burning. This means that their benefits to humanity cannot be overemphasized. Although vitamins and other supplements do not prevent death, they offer a great deal in the enhancement of one’s health. It is, therefore, imperative to know that the intake of supplements can be unhealthy as much as they are used to enhance health.
One of the reasons is that too much consumption of these substances may lead to defects. Also, taking some supplements before surgery may pose a danger to the success of the operation. Hence, one must tell the doctor about whatever supplements or vitamins one intends to take. It is best to get a prescription for any supplements.
Supplements and Vitamins to Stay Fit
Here are some of the supplements and vitamins one needs to take to stay fit as well as improve daily performance
Vitamin D
The best way to get this vitamin is to take in daily supplements. The reason is that spending too much time in the sun is very dangerous to health. The significant benefit of taking Vitamin D is that it helps to reduce one’s cancer risk.
Vitamin C
Apart from helping one to stay fit and healthy, the intake of Vitamin C goes a long way to help lower the risk of mental damage or dementia. Vitamin C can be obtained from fruits and vegetables.
Vitamin K2
It may be a bit strenuous and cost-ineffective to drink 5 litres of milk daily, therefore, taking Vitamin K2 supplements is the best bet. The intake of this vitamin helps keep the bones healthy and prevents them from breaking.
Vitamin B
This vitamin goes a long way to help fight off stress. Vitamin B has eight essential classifications that are obtained from fish, dairy products, and meat. The classifications are – Riboflavin, Niacin, Thiamine, Pantothenic, Vitamin B6, Biotin, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12.
Folic Acid
Folic Acid helps to decrease the risk of specific congenital disabilities.
Vitamin A
This vitamin helps to boost the eyesight and also covers all the overall health of the eyes. Liver, yoghurt, spinach, carrots, pepper, and milk are foods high in Vitamin A.
Omega-3 fatty acids
This supplement helps to make the skin grow healthy as well as help to prevent heart diseases. The best source of Omega-3 fatty acids is fish oils.
