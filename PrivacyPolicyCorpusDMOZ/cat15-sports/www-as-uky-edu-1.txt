Education Policy Committee
Share this page:
The College's Education Policy Committee (EPC) is made up of nine faculty members, three from each discipline that makes up the College of Arts and Sciences.  Its members are elected by the faculty and serve three-year, staggered terms.  The Education Policy Committee advises the dean, the Executive Committee, departments and faculty on all educational policy matters related to teaching, research, and service.  The Committee has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the faculty in approving or disapproving all proposals for new programs and courses and for changes in programs and courses.
