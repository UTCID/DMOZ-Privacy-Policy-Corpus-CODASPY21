MINOR ATHLETE ABUSE PREVENTION POLICY (MAAPP)
USA Swimming’s top priority continues to be keeping our athletes safe. No form of abuse, including child sexual abuse, has a place in our sport. As a part of its continued commitment to safeguarding our athletes, USA Swimming has enacted enhancements to Safe Sport policy and education requirements.
The U.S. Center for SafeSport (“the Center”), the separate, independent, organization that oversees all sexual misconduct reports in the Olympic and Paralympic Movement created the Minor Athlete Abuse Prevention Policies to set a baseline for acceptable safety standards that limit one-on-one interactions between adults and minor athletes. The Center urged all National Governing Bodies (NGBs) to add restrictions tailored to fit the sport.
USA Swimming released the Minor Athlete Protection Policy (MAAPP) addressing one-on-one interactions, social media and electronic communications, travel: local and team, locker rooms and changing areas and massages, rubdowns and athletic training modalities in April 2019.  All USA Swimming member clubs were required to implement MAAPP in June 23, 2019.
Below you will find the Minor Athlete Abuse Prevention Policy in full. Join USA Swimming and Missouri Valley Swimming in our commitment to do more to keep our athletes safe and abuse out of our sport.
