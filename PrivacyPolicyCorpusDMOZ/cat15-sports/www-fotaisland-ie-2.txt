HomeCookie Policy Cookie Policy
Cookies
We use a number of different cookies on our websites.
WHAT IS A COOKIE?
A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could allow the Site to recognise your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information, and let you navigate the Site effectively. Cookies can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
To find out more about cookies please see http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm.
How are they used?
Our websites use 2 different types of cookie:
Session Cookies
Persistent Cookies
Session Cookies are temporary cookies that are not persistently stored on your computer or mobile device. They are used to deliver basic functions of a website while you are actively using it – for instance during a registration process. Session cookies are generally erased when you close your browser.
Persistent cookies are those placed on your computer or mobile device for a pre-determined length of time when you visit this site. This allows the site to deliver functions between browser sessions and subsequent visits.
COOKIES USED ON THE SITE
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to collect information about visitor behaviour on our website. Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We therefore do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.
