Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)COPPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information -- for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms -- when they are tied to individually identifiable information.At this time, USA Rugby requires parental consent for children under the age of 13 to register or provide other information to USA Rugby through the use of the internet website, www.usa.rugby. If, at any time, USA Rugby policy changes to allow for the collection of information from children under the age of 13, the changes will be notified in this document, and additional information will be provided pursuant to COPPA, in the form of: (a) names and contact information of operators employed by USA Rugby to collect this data; (b) types of information and reasons for USA Rugby to obtain this information from children; (c) procedures by which parents can review a child's personal information.CHILDREN 13 & UNDERPlease pay close attention to the information outlined in this document.
