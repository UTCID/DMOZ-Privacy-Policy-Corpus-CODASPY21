Meetings & Conventions
Gather at Gatlinburg.
Describing Gatlinburg is easy.  Nestled in the foothills of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, our quaint town is filled with everything a meeting planner needs for a successful event:  beautiful, well-equipped meeting facilities, hotels, motels cabins, condominiums and chalets, hundreds of shops and restaurants, and attractions for groups of every age and interest.  All in an accessible, walkable destination
Gatlinburg Convention & Visitors Bureau
7 Time Winner!
“ConventionSouth readers and fans have voted to decide the best meeting sites in the South, and it is no surprise to us that Gatlinburg Convention & Visitors Bureau has been selected to receive our annual Readers’ Choice Award,” said ConventionSouth Publisher J. Talty O’Connor. “The value in receiving this prestigious recognition is that it comes from the United States’ top meeting professionals who hold events in the South. These planners demand the highest level of customer service and quality facilities, and they have contributed in determining that Gatlinburg Convention & Visitors Bureau indeed displays the commitment to professionalism, creativity and service that they require.”
This is the seventh time that the Gatlinburg Convention & Visitors Bureau has received the award, making it an even greater honor to present it with a 2018 Readers’ Choice Award.
