Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SITE AND USJF MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SITE OR AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, OR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON THIS SITE, OF ANY KIND. THE SITE AND ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE SITE AND USJF DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NO LIENS AND NO ENCUMBRANCES; (II) THE WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION OR VIOLATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF ANY PERSON; (III) WARRANTIES ARISING THROUGH COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE; AND (IV) THE WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CORRECTNESS, OR COMPLETENESS OF DATA OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SITE OR OTHERWISE BY USJF.   WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, THAT THE SITE, ITS FUNCTION, USER CONTENT AND/OR ITS CONTENT WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE, ERROR-FREE, COMPLETE, UPDATED, VIRUSE-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, USJF AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ARBITRATION AND/OR LITIGATION).

Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the USJF, and its affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective officers, directors, contractors, agents, employees, successors and assigns of and from any and all demands, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, interest, penalties, losses, costs, expenses and harms, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees of other professional advisers, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site. These obligations will survive any termination of these Terms.
Dispute Resolution & Arbitration
In the event you have a customer concern or dispute, you may call the USJF Customer Support Center at 541-889-8753. If the Customer Support Center is unable to resolve your concern or complaint, we each agree (pursuant to these Terms) that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration (or in Small Claims Court if your claims qualify), rather than in court. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis, as class arbitrations and/or class actions are not permitted. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court. In addition to resolving disputes through arbitration proceedings, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, and this arbitration agreement does not preclude your filing of a claim in federal, state, or local agencies. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. As these Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Lastly, we also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Arbitration Procedures. USJF and you agree that any such arbitration proceeding between us will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing. USJF will reimburse you for those arbitration filing fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Notice of Dispute. For any dispute arising from your use of the Site, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give the USJF an opportunity to resolve the dispute by contacting our Customer Support Center at 541-889-8753. If either you or us intends to seek arbitration to resolve a dispute hereunder, such party must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the other party. A Notice to USJF should be addressed to: Dispute Resolution, USJF, PO Box 338, Ontario, OR 97914-0338 USA. Phone: (541) 889-8753 (the “Notice Address”). The Notice must describe (a) the facts giving rise to the dispute, and (b) a proposed solution (“Demand”). If USJF and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or USJF may commence an arbitration proceeding. Both parties agree to negotiate in good faith about your problem or dispute. In the event we make any future changes to this arbitration provision (other notice address, website link or Customer Support telephone number), such change will not apply to any dispute as to which we have already received written notice on the effective date of the change.
Time Limits. Subject to applicable law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in arbitration or small claims court. Such one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute isn’t filed within the one-year period, it will be deemed untimely and be barred.
General Terms
Merger and Severability. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between USJF and you, and any prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us is hereby merged herein, replaced and superseded by the Terms hereof. In the event any provision(s) of these Terms is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions and Terms hereof shall remain valid and enforceable.
No Waiver. In the event USJF fails to enforce any of the provisions of these Terms shall not in any way waive the right of USJF to thereafter enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms.
Assignment and Binding Effects. You may not assign these Terms or any rights or obligations herein without the prior written consent of the USJF. These Terms are binding upon each party and its respective successors, heirs, trustees, administrators, executors and permitted assigns.
Customers Needing Extra Assistance. It is the intention of USJF to provide full access to the Site regardless of disability. If you have difficulties using the Site, please call our Customer Support Center at 541-889-8753 for assistance.
