The Els Group employs a range of measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information in subscriber lists, email content and reports. We use Campaign Monitor to scan the content of your campaigns to protect against defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, or threatening material that is racially or ethnically offensive.

Special Offers and Updates
We send all new users a welcoming email to verify their new account and confirm their password and username. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Customers can unsubscribe via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each email.

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each email.

Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
