However, we will not retain any of your personal information beyond this period and the retention of your personal information will be subject to periodic review. We may keep an anonymized form of your personal information, which will no longer refer to you, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.
Cookies:
When you visit our website, we may place an informational text file about you called a "cookie", in the browser files of your computer's hard drive. Generally websites use the information to improve your experience in their site. For example, a cookie allows the ability to personalize information, or to help with online sales, or simply for the purposes of tracking popular pages on a site or demographics.
Cookies also provide programmers with a quick and convenient means of keeping website content fresh and relevant to the user's interests. This information can be valuable to targeting content or advertising to you. The cookie itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
We also use cookies to track user traffic patterns.
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the public area of this site, however you'll need cookies enabled to access the password protected "membership area" of this site.
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out.
Transfer of Information:
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your information to the United States (or any other country where we operate), where the privacy laws may not be as protective as in your country or jurisdiction. By using our website, you consent to the collection, transfer, use, storage, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of our services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or another country in accordance with applicable law. The privacy and data protection laws in the country to which your information is transferred may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. Your personal information may be subject to the laws of the country to which it is transferred and may be accessible without notice to you by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of that country. By using our website or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.
Our Commitment To Data Security:
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
