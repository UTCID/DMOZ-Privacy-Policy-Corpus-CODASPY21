Some of the personal information that ClubLink may collect in the course of our business includes demographic information, financial information such as credit card information and personal address information.
Personal information as noted above is typically collected through Membership application forms and various documents that Members and guests provide to us from time to time in order to update the information on file. In some cases this includes information that Members provide through the Member's Only web site.

ClubLink is dedicated to providing you with outstanding service and this includes providing you with the peace of mind associated with knowing that your personal information is protected.
Collection of Personal Information
In order to provide you with the level of service that meets your expectations, from time to time we may require you to provide us with personal information. However, before we collect any personal information from you, we will identify the purpose for which we need to collect and use this information.
Some of the reasons for which we may need personal information include:To process your Membership application;To book your event or banquet; orTo update your Membership file
Once we have collected the information that we need, we will only use that information for the identified purpose. If we were going to use this information for any other purpose, we will check with you first to get your consent.
ClubLink will limit its collection of your personal information to that which it needs to properly service your account or to provide you with the services you request. Where other information is requested, we will only use this information for the purpose identified at the time we collect it, for internal statistical purposes or for external purposes only when the data collected is aggregated so as not to make any of your personal information identifiable.
Consent
Before we collect any personal, private information from you, we will get your consent. Consent can be either express or implied.
In matters relating to particularly sensitive information such as financial information, we would require you to provide us with express consent. Express consent can be given either in writing or orally. For example, when you apply for a Membership and provide us with your credit card information, we require your signature as your consent to allow us to use your credit card information for payment purposes.
In other matters, your consent may be implied. For instance, if you make a purchase at one of our golf shops and present your credit card for payment purposes, your consent to our using your credit card number will be implied and no further consent will be sought.

ClubLink will never sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to any outside agency or organization for commercial purposes without your consent. On occasion, certain organizations may present an opportunity for our Membership that we will determine to be of interest to you and we will pass this information on to you. However, we will never pass on your personal information without first getting your consent.
Because of the possibility for the inadvertent disclosure of your personal information to those not authorized to receive it, we will limit disclosure of information pertaining to your account, your Membership status and any other information we have on file, to you.

ClubLink may use your personal information on an aggregated basis for disclosure to third parties, for example to provide a third party with a demographic statistic such as '25% of our Members are between the ages of 35 - 45'. However, be assured that you will never be personally identified.
ClubLink, like many organizations, is subject to certain legislative requirements regarding the retention of certain records for a period of time. As long as you are an active Member or client of ClubLink, we will maintain a file containing the information necessary to service your needs. We will update your file as you provide us with new information.

They are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our web servers or our data. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Encryption is used whenever financial information, customer identification, personal information and passwords are transmitted to our servers over the Internet.
