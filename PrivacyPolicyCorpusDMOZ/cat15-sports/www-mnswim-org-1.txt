Minnesota Swimming's Commitment to Privacy This website is a general audience website.
While we encourage members to browse our website, we also wish to educate parents and children about issues of privacy when visiting our site. As a result, we are committed to full compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the USA-S Swimming Privacy Policy. COPPA applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected on line, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the enforcing authority.
Information gathered by Minnesota Swimming Minnesota Swimming does not gather or store personal information about athletes on its website. Information acquired during registration for swim meets is the property of USA Swimming and its use is within the control of USA Swimming. USA Swimming strictly limits the use of member’s personal information to that information necessary for the conduct of the business of USA Swimming and its LSCs. Minnesota Swimming adheres to COPPA through the following:
Limited advertising permitted on our website, subject to Minnesota Swimming’s promotions policy. Click here to see Minnesota Swimming's promotions policy.
There is no collection of personal information on the website that includes athlete’s full name, home address, email address, or telephone number that would allow someone to identify or contact a child.
While Minnesota Swimming tracks usage statistics on its website through Google Analytics, we do not track information linked to individuals who visit the web site.
Access to private information on the website is controlled by limiting the staff and Board members with administrative access to Minnesota Swimming’s website.
Limited pictures of children are allowed on the website and Minnesota Swimming’s social media sites (Facebook, Twitter).
Minnesota Swimming obtains a signed release from parent/guardians if children are singled out in any way or a picture is obtained from a non-public event or setting.
Pictures from public events are published, but at no time is a child identified by other than a first name; team caps are blurred when possible; Minnesota Swimming complies with suggested Federal guidelines to limit identifiable markers photographs so there are no more than 3 markers.
Parents may request that any posted photograph or any other information that they feel is too identifiable be removed from the Minnesota Swimming website.
Children’s information is never shared with third parties (other than USA Swimming).
Third-Party Sites and Sponsors Our site contains limited links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices, which may differ from ours.
