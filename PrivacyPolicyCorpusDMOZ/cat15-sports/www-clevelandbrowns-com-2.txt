2.        CONTENT YOU SUBMIT AND COMMUNITY USAGE RULES.
A. User-Generated Content.
(i) General. The Browns may now, or in the future, offer users of the Service the opportunity to create, build, post, upload, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise make available on or submit (a) through the Service, or (b) on or in response to our pages or posts on any third-party platforms, or (c) in connection with any of our promotions by any media or manner, or (d) otherwise submit to us (e.g., on our Facebook or other social media pages, in response to our tweets, through a sweepstakes or contest, or by otherwise sending it to us) (collectively, "submit") messages, text, illustrations, files, images, graphics, photos, comments, responses, sounds, music, videos, information, content, ratings, reviews, data, questions, suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other information or materials and the ideas contained therein (collectively, but excluding Browns Licensed Elements included therein, "User-Generated Content" or "UGC"). You may submit UGC through your profile, forums, blogs, message boards, social networking environments, content creation and posting tools, gameplay, social communities, contact us tools, email, and other communications functionality. Except to the extent of the rights and license you grant in these Terms and, subject to any applicable Additional Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable right, title, and interest that you have in your UGC.
(ii) Non-Confidentiality of Your User-Generated Content. Except as otherwise described in the Service's posted Privacy Policy or any applicable Additional Terms, you agree that (a) your UGC will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary by us  regardless of whether you mark it "confidential," "proprietary," or the like  and will not be returned, and (b) to the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Browns do not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third-party with respect to your UGC. Upon request, you will provide documentation necessary to authenticate rights to such content and verify your compliance with these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms. You acknowledge that the Internet and mobile communications may be insecure and subject to breaches of security; accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that your UGC is submitted at your own risk.
In your communications with us, please keep in mind that we do not seek any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services or even suggested improvements to products or services, including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, inventions, or designs for apparel, equipment, coaching, on-field play, recruitment, branding, marketing, promotions, music, websites, apps, books, scripts, screenplays, motion pictures, television shows, theatrical productions, software or otherwise (collectively, "Unsolicited Ideas and Materials"). Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you submit are deemed UGC and licensed to us as set forth below. In addition, the Browns retain all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials. The Browns' receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by us of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair our right to contest existing or future Intellectual Property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.
(iii) License to the Browns of Your UGC. Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a promotion's official rules) that specifically govern the submission of your UGC or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy, you hereby grant the Browns the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your UGC (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such UGC and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any UGC for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services. You understand that in exercising such rights, metadata, notices and content may be removed or altered, including copyright management information, and you consent thereto and represent and warrant you have all necessary authority to do so. In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to the Browns to your UGC, you also, as permitted by applicable law, hereby grant to the Browns, and agree to grant to the Browns, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any UGC, without any obligation or remuneration to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any UGC, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 2.A(iii).
(iv) The Browns' Exclusive Right to Manage Our Service. The Browns may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of any of your UGC, and we may, in our sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove, or refuse to post or otherwise make use of UGC without notice or any liability to you or any third-party in connection with our operation of UGC venues in an appropriate manner, such as to enhance accessibility of UGC, address copyright infringement, and protect Users from harmful UGC. Without limitation, we may, but do not commit to, do so to (a) address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate or (b) enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms. Such UGC submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time, and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, change, remove, or otherwise use such UGC on the Service or elsewhere, except that California minors have certain rights to have certain content about them that they have themselves posted on the Service prospectively removed from public display as provided for in the Privacy Policy.
(v) Representations and Warranties Related to Your UGC. Each time you submit any UGC, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside (18 in Ohio) and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any UGC you submit, and that, as to that UGC, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the Intellectual Property and other rights to the UGC, or you have a lawful right to submit the UGC and grant the Browns the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, all without any obligation by the Browns to obtain consent of any third-party and without creating any obligation or liability for the Browns; (b) the UGC is accurate; (c) the UGC does not and, as to the Browns' permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any Intellectual Property or other right of any third-party; and (d) the UGC will not violate these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.
(vi) California Consumer Rights and Notices. Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service and who have posted content or information on the Service can request that such information be removed from the Service by contacting us at the email or address set forth in Section 7. Such request must state that the requester personally posted such content or information and must detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished the post, and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and others that we do not control. Since minors are not authorized to use our Service we may also terminate any minor's accounts that come to our attention.
B.        Community Usage Rules.  In addition to the rules below, we may from time-to-time issue Community Usage Rules ("Rules") to govern the use of the Service's online communities ("Communities").
*(i)      *At minimum, your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
Your UGC. All of your UGC either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. Your UGC should not contain or display any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties in a manner that implies a false endorsement. Do not use any UGC that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet. If anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to the Browns. (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to the Browns
as your UGC, then you must obtain your friend's and the photographer's permission to do so.)
Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family. If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know  and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
Act Appropriately. All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your UGC might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your UGC must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, age, military status, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or handicap. Your UGC must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit. Your UGC must not exploit children under the age of 18.
Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes. Your UGC must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or any politician, public servant, or law.
Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications. Do not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Service by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications. Do not solicit personal information from anyone or solicit passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes. This includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation.
Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.  Your UGC must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your UGC. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit UGC that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company. In the event you receive anything in consideration from us with respect to your UGC (e.g., coupons, sweepstakes entries, etc.) you represent you will include disclosure of the receipt of this consideration clearly and conspicuously as part of the UGC and will include any other disclosures we may require.
Others Can See. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members. However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and UGC that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces, and take care when otherwise disclosing this type of information to others.
Don't Share Other People's Personal Information. Your UGC should not reveal another person's address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by the Browns (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).
Don't Damage the Service or Anyone's Computers or Other Devices. Your UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.
If you submit UGC that we reasonably believe violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by applicable law. We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions or other requirements referred to above in a form acceptable to us. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the UGC in question being removed from the Service.
(ii)      Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.
C. Appropriate Content and Alerting Us of Violations. We expect UGC to be appropriate for a general audience, but do not undertake any obligation to monitor it, and you consent to potentially encountering content you find offensive or inappropriate. We may include venue and content rules as Additional Terms. If you discover any content that violates these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, then you may report it here. For alleged infringements of Intellectual Property rights, see Section 6.

B.        Content Use Restrictions.  You also agree that, in using the Service, you: (i) will not monitor, gather, copy, or distribute the Content (except as may be a result of standard search engine activity or use of a standard browser) on the Service by using any robot, rover, "bot", spider, scraper, crawler, spyware, engine, device, software, extraction tool, or any other automatic device, utility, or manual process of any kind; (ii) will not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any such content (including any images, text, or page layout); (iii) will keep intact all Trademark, copyright, and other Intellectual Property and other notices contained in such content; (iv) will not use such content in a manner that suggests an unauthorized association with any of our or our licensors' products, services, or brands; (v) will not make any modifications to such content (other than to the extent of your specifically permitted use of Browns Licensed Elements, if applicable); (vi) will not copy, modify, reproduce, archive, sell, lease, rent, exchange, create derivative works from, publish by hard copy or electronic means, publicly perform, display, disseminate, distribute, broadcast, retransmit, circulate or transfer to any third-party or on any third-party application or website, or otherwise use or exploit such content in any way for any purpose, except as specifically permitted by these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms or with the prior written consent of an officer of the Browns or, in the case of content from a licensor, the owner of the content; and (vii) will not insert any code or product to manipulate such content in any way that adversely affects any user experience or the Service.
C. Availability of Service and Content. We, in our sole discretion and without advance notice or liability, may immediately suspend or terminate the availability of the Service and/or Content (and any elements and features of them), in whole or in part, for any reason, in our sole discretion.

4.        CREATING AN ACCOUNT.
A. Accounts. If you register with us (or with a third-party partner of ours in connection with the Service) or create an account, you are solely responsible and liable for the security and confidentiality of your access credentials and for restricting access to your Device and for all activity under your account. Usernames and passwords must be personal and unique and must not violate the rights of any person or entity or be deemed offensive by us. We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any reason in our sole discretion. You are solely responsible for your registration information and for updating and maintaining it. You will immediately notify us here
of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or username, or any other breach of security, but will remain responsible for any unauthorized use thereafter. You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights. Your account information, including your photo, may be used by us for identity management and fraud prevention on and off the Service.
Accounts may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual that is the subject of the account and who is of the applicable age of majority. We do not review accounts for authenticity and are not responsible for any unauthorized accounts that may appear on the Service.

B. Profiles. We may, either directly or through a third-party partner, from time-to-time permit you to set up private, semi-private and/or public profile pages ("Profile Page(s)") that allow you to provide and/or display information about you. Your Profile Page may not include any form of prohibited UGC, as outlined in Section 2 above and in our Rules. Without limiting the foregoing, Profile Pages may not include content regarding goods or services that you are attempting to sell through the Service and cannot be used to conduct commercial activities, including, but not limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests or other promotions, absent our prior written consent. We may offer you the ability to set preferences relating to your profile or Service activities, but settings may not become effective immediately or be error free and options may change from time-to-time. We assume no responsibility or liability for users' profile material. Your profile information, including your photo, may be used by us for identity management and fraud prevention on and off the Service.
Profile Pages may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual that is the subject of the Profile Page. We do not review Profile Pages to determine if they were created by an appropriate party, and we are not responsible for any unauthorized Profile Pages that may appear on the Service. If there is any dispute as to whether a Profile Page has been created or is being maintained by an authorized representative of the individual who is the subject of that Profile Page, then we shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve such dispute as we determine is appropriate, in our sole discretion. Such resolution may include, without limitation, deleting or disabling access to Profile Pages, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice.

Email Messages.You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and, if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails, the opt-out will be so limited. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements, and these informational or transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.
C. Text Messages. You may be given opportunities to subscribe to various text marketing or other text messaging programs and, by doing so, you consent to receive ongoing text alerts (including via actual or potential auto-dialers) from us related to our various businesses and affiliates, which may include co-promotions with or about other parties, except that if the scope of your consent for a particular subscription is limited, that subscription will be so limited. Such consent is not required to purchase any product or service aside from the text subscription itself. For each subscription, text "HELP" for help and text "STOP" to terminate (i.e., opt-out of) that subscription. Subsequent or different subscriptions will be unaffected by an opt-out. You consent to receive a text confirming any opt-out as well as non-marketing administrative or transactional messages. For subscriptions to recurring text messages, you may receive up to the number of text messages per month specified in your consent or to which you later consent (to the extent specified). Alerts auto-renew unless otherwise specified when you consented.

D. Location-Based Features. If GPS, geo-location, or other location-based features are enabled on your Device, you acknowledge that your Device location may be tracked and may be shared with others consistent with the Privacy Policy. In addition, if you use our wi-fi services (such as in FirstEnergy Stadium) or the wi-fi services of a third party we work with, your Device may be tracked when you use that service, even when you have location-awareness turned off on your Device. If you do not consent to such tracking, do not use the wi-fi service. In addition, you may encounter beacons in our facilities (such as FirstEnergy Stadium) that track your Device through Bluetooth or wi-fi; however, see our Privacy Policy regarding choices you have regarding use of this technology for Interest-based Advertising. Some Devices and platforms may allow disabling some, but not all, location-based features or managing such preferences. However, typically your proximity or connection to wi-fi, Bluetooth and other networks may still be tracked when location services are turned off on Device settings. You can terminate Device location tracking via our mobile app by uninstalling the application. Territory geo-filtering may be required in connection with use of some Service features due, for instance, to Content territory restrictions. The location-based services offered in connection with the Browns' mobile app(s) or feature(s), such as map and directions features, are for individual use only and should not be used or relied on in any situation in which the failure or inaccuracy of use of the location-based services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or physical or property damage. Use location-based services at your own risk as location data may not be accurate.

9.        ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE TERMS.
A.        Forum Selection/Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction and venue for any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, the Content, your UGC, these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, (collectively, "Dispute") shall be in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Cuyahoga County, Ohio for any and all purposes.
B.        Pre-Arbitration Notification. The Browns and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that the Browns need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned ("IP Disputes," and, together with all other disputes, the "General Disputes"). In the event of a Dispute, the party making a claim  whether you or the Browns  shall send a letter to the other party briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If the Browns are making a claim, the letter shall be sent via email to the email address listed in your Service account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 9.B. If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 76 Lou Groza Blvd, Berea, Ohio 44017 (Attn: General Counsel). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 9. Either you or the Browns, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to Section 9.D) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.
C.       Arbitration of Claims.All
actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon, or relating to any Dispute or the scope of the provisions of this Section shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (www.adr.org) for final and binding arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, which shall be held in Cuyahoga County, Ohio before a single arbitrator. If the matter in dispute is between the Browns and a consumer, the matter shall be submitted to AAA in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by AAA. We may have the right to pay the AAA fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates' lawyers, insurance providers, auditors, and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator's award is based. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter has been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator's award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Cuyahoga County, Ohio or, if sought by the Browns, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator's decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.
D.       Limitation on Injunctive Relief. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, UGC (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED UGC), PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED, OR CONTROLLED BY ANY BROWNS PARTY (DEFINED BELOW) OR A LICENSOR OF ANY BROWNS PARTY.
E.        Governing Law.These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, General Disputes, IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against the Browns or by the Browns against you pursuant to this Section 9 or otherwise related to the Service, Content, Browns Licensed Elements, UGC or any other of our products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. This Section 9 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. and not by the law of any state and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and the Browns agree that we intend that this Section 9 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 9 can only be amended by mutual agreement. Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 9 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
F.        Class Action Waiver.To the extent permitted by applicable law, both you and the Browns waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 9 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding and not in arbitration.
G.       Jury Waiver. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON, OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF, AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.
H.       Small Claims Matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 9.F.
I. The provisions of this Section 9 shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties. This Section 9 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.

A. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY BROWNS PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including personal injury or death or for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages of any kind, including without limitation loss of profits, in connection with or otherwise directly or indirectly related to, without limitation, the Service, Content, Browns Licensed Elements, UGC, or our other products or services, except, to the extent not waivable under applicable law, for direct damages for personal injury caused by a physical product manufactured, sold, or provided by the Browns.

12. UPDATES TO TERMS.
It is your responsibility to review the posted Terms and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission).

Any new Terms or Additional Terms will be effective as to new uses and transactions as of the time that we post them or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. In the event that any notice to you of new, revised, or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You can reject any new, revised, or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Service.
