Conclusion
Introduction
My name is Neil Gunton, and I am
the website founder, developer, administrator and editor of this
website. This Help document is intended to tell you everything you
need to know to use the site, including editing your own journals,
posting on the forums and guestbooks, and using all the other powerful
tools that are available.
For an overview of the different areas of the website, see the Site Map.
Navigating the website
There is a navigation bar, or "navbar", which is a menu of links
at the top of every page. You can use the navbar to get anywhere on
the website within a couple of clicks; the links correspond to all the
major functional areas of the site. The navigation bar is
hierarchical, and you can look at each link as being like a tab on a
file binder. When you click on the forums, for example, you will see
that tab (or link) gets highlighted, and subtabs (links to sections
within this one) are shown underneath the main tab. In general if you
get lost in the website then the navigation bar should be able to get
you anywhere in the site in just a few clicks.
For example, see the screenshot image below. In this example, we
are currently in the "Website" tab, and you can see the additional
areas available under this (About, Help, FAQ etc) as more tabs
underneath the Website tab.
Sometimes you will see directions to some part of the site written
like this: "My > Options". What this is referring to is the tabs on
the navbar - in this example, you would first click on the "My" top
level tab, and then the "Options" subtab which appears under
that. This is just a convenient shorthand which allows for quick
reference to the hierarchy of links in the navbar.
If you ever get completely lost, you should be able to find your
way back to the place you want to be by using the navbar. And if you
are ever hopelessly confused (even after reading this Help doc), then
go on over to the Website top level tab, and
then under that click on the
Contact subtab to ask me questions.
Registration
To register, click on the Register link
which is on the left hand side of the front page.
Registration is a fairly quick, two-step process that involves
entering your name and email address, and choosing a username and a
login password. A verification email is then sent automatically. You
will need to click on the link in the email in order to activate your
account.
Below are some additional notes on the registration process which
you should read so that you are aware of the issues involved with
things like email addresses and "real names".
Email Addresses
Your information will never be shared or sold to anyone else, so
your email address will be safe - and it will never be displayed in
the open on the website. See the Privacy Statement page for more details on this,
but the short version is that I will NEVER voluntarily give, sell or
rent your information to anyone else for marketing purposes (or any
other purpose, actually - the only exception is if law enforcement has
some sort of warrant, but if that's the case then you most likely have
bigger problems than me disclosing your email address). You will not
get spam from this website. When people need to contact you, they will
use a contact form, which does not reveal your email address during
the posting process (all that happens on the server side - when they
submit the form, then an email gets sent to you from the server. This
email has the sender's email address, so you can then reply to them
and carry on a normal email conversation if you want to). There might
be the very rare case where you post a classified ad, and a spammer
trawling the contact forms gets through my checks, but that is the
exception, not the rule - and even then they were only able to send
their spam - they didn't get to see your address.
The only way your email address could be exposed is if you post it
explicitly in text somewhere, e.g. on the forums or in the text of a
journal page. Even then, I have code that automatically detects email
addresses in posted text, and obfuscates it so that it cannot be read
by spambots. Any email address posted in text is changed to look like
this: click to show email. Try clicking on this (it will only
work if you're logged in) - the email address should be revealed. And
then, if you click again, it will open an email composition window to
send an email. Only registered users can click to decode these emails,
so they are also safe from "drive by" spammers who are manually
trolling for addresses. And finally, even if a spammer does register
on the site just to get emails, then I also have limits in place for
how frequently addresses can be decoded by a given user. In other
words, I have put a number of speed bumps in place which make posted
email addresses available to users, while doing my best to keep them
hidden from the bad actors like spammers.
Since your information is kept very safe, I ask that you use your
REAL email address, the one that you check regularly, rather than a
throwaway. This is so that I can get in touch with you if the need
arises - if I send you an email, and it gets bounced or there is no
reply, then I have no way of telling you about problems with your
account, and this may leave me with no other option but to disable
it. This wastes both my and your time, I have to deal with thousands
of people who use the site, so PLEASE just use your actual email
address that you check regularly. Also, if you do ever end up changing
your email address, please come back to the site at some point and
update your account - you can do this easily, it's under My > Account.
One Person Per Account
Please only register one person per account.
If you are a couple
or a group who wants to register, then you need to register each
person individually. Do not do things like "AnneAndRob Dillaney",
which is obviously an attempt to get around the checks I do for
multiple names (I look for words like 'and', which usually indicate
more than one person). The reason for this is so that each person can
have their own distinct profile, which includes an optional bio that
the person can write about themselves. People are unique - even if you
are a couple who does everything together, you are in fact still
unique individuals, and I want the site to reflect that. When people
post on the forums, it should be obvious who is doing the talking, so
you should always log in under your own account rather than just being
lazy and using your husband's or wife's (there have been cases where
couples both use the same account, and it's very confusing to see a
post on the forums where the author is apparently by one person, but
then the post is signed by someone else - it makes people wonder if
the account has been hacked, and you will be having to explain
yourselves endlessly to make clear who it is that is really
talking). Another reason for having separate accounts is that even
though you may think you do everything together, one day one of you
might be wanting to post something that the other person is not
participating in. Having distinct accounts allows one of you to post
something that is "just you". Or, if the relationship should sour and
you part ways, then it will be much harder if both personas are mixed
together in one single account.
If you are a couple that usually uses the same email address, then
it's ok to use that address on both accounts.
It's worth noting that if you want to author a journal by multiple
people, then it is very easy to list the relevant usernames in the
'Authors' field when you are creating the journal. The website
explicitly caters to having journals by more than one person, and this
assumes each person has their own account.
Finally, please note that "one person per account" is not a
request, it is one of the basic rules of the website. Any account that
attempts to circumvent this rule risks getting either disabled or
removed.
Don't Register More Than Once
I generally ask that people only register once, since
topicwise,
townwise,
profilewise,
bleepwise
and crazyguyonabike all
share the same user directory. However if you feel the need to have
one "public" persona that uses your real name and one "private" one
that uses a pseudonym, then I think it might be reasonable for you to
register two accounts. Be warned though that anybody who registers
multiple accounts for the purposes of
making sock
puppets will be swiftly banned from using the site. Only accounts
made in good faith, without deception or other subterfuge intended to
deceive others, will be allowed. I don't mind anonymity for legitimate
purposes, but just don't assume that this gives you a blank slate for
bad behavior - you'll end up kicked off the site, guaranteed.
Real Names
I ask people to use their real names when registering on this
website. The reason for this is that when you are interacting with
other people, it helps if you know their real name, rather than some
made-up alias; this tends to foster a better sense of trust in the
community, while also making people seem more real to each other and
less like anonymous avatars. While anonymity certainly has its place
(e.g. for people who are in sensitive jobs, or who are victims of
political or domestic abuse, or even if you just want to talk about
something that is socially taboo and you don't want it to come back to
bite you in real life), I think it's safe to say that most of
the time, it's better if people are communicating openly with each
other. The problem with anonymity is that it tends to remove the sense
of consequences based on your behavior toward others - it encourages
bad and juvenile behavior. If you know that your real name is attached
to your words, then you will perhaps think a bit more carefully before
casually insulting someone.
When people see real names, it tends to make the other people on
the site more real, and it also encourages a more civil discourse than
when everybody is anonymous. Also, it makes it easier to link the
people you are talking to with your real-life relationships. While
it's true that some people will give fake names just for the hell of
it (and with a mind to create mischief), these people will generally
make themselves known through their behavior, and they will be dealt
with appropriately eventually. In the meantime, the rest of the people
on the site will be able to enjoy the benefits of knowing that most of
the people they are conversing with are real, and not some random
avatar like Loverboy69.
Some people believe that having their real name "visible" on the
internet can compromise their security, or allow their identity to be
stolen. In general, it's worth remembering that our real name is out
in the world anyway, you interact with countless individuals and
businesses on a daily basis using your real name. Unless you are
posting sensitive personal information online (which you probably
shouldn't be doing anyway), there's usually not much to worry about
with regard to simply having your real name be visible.
That said, of course there are always exceptions - genuine cases
where people honestly just don't want their real names to be
exposed. Examples of legitimate situations include people who are in
sensitive jobs (e.g. prison authorities or other government work that
requires discretion), victims of domestic violence or other types of
abuse, political dissidents, and so on. For people with such concerns,
there are privacy options, which we cover next.
Name Privacy
On the registration form and the My > Account form, you can select
how you want your real name to be displayed on the site, if at
all. This affects the places where your name is displayed by the
system, e.g. on the title page of your journals, or message headers on
the forums etc. If you type your name manually in some text (e.g. in
the body of a forum post) then that won't be affected - it'll be shown
exactly as you type it. So, this option gives you the ability to
protect your name in the places on the site where it is displayed
automatically, but not in free text. The 'Name Privacy' form field has
a number of options:
Public - this means your name will be shown to everybody,
including Google's search bot.
No Search Engines - your name will be viewable by real
people browsing the site, but if a bot from one of the major search
engines is detected (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc) then your real
name will not be shown. Instead, just your username is displayed.
Registered Users Only - your name will be shown to people
who are logged in. Guests, bots and others will only be shown your
username.
Private - your name is never displayed. Instead, your
username is shown.
Name Format
In addition to the 'Name Privacy' option described above, there is
an option to allow you to control how your name is shown, when the
privacy option allows it to be displayed. This option operates
similarly and in tandem with the 'Name Privacy' option. You can select
one of the following:
Full name - your full first and last name are shown, e.g. Neil Gunton
First name, last initial - Your first name is shown, but
only the first initial of your last name, e.g. Neil G.
First initial, last name - Only the initial of your first
name is shown, with your complete last name, e.g. N. Gunton
Obviously this name format option only comes into play if your name is
actually being shown on the site at all. For example, if you selected
'Private' in the 'Name Privacy' option, then the name format option
will be moot.
Google Policy
While most people are ok with their journals and other content
being findable via search engines like Google, some prefer that they
not be included in those indexes. So, this option allows you to make a
'policy' for whether or not search engines will be allowed to index
your content. Here, 'content' means anything you post while logged in,
which includes journals, articles, classifieds, forums, reviews and
your profile.
If you select 'Allow', the default, then the search engines will
be able to index everything as normal. But if you select 'Disallow',
then a 'noindex' metatag will be added to your pages. This is an
indicator that is generally honored by all the major search
engines. They may crawl pages that are marked 'noindex', but they
should not add them to their search index.
In addition to the 'noindex' metatags, the index pages where your
content may be listed will also be affected. Since those index pages
generally contain content from many different people, they will be
indexed by the search engines; however the entries for content that
has a 'disallow' Google policy will simply be omitted. This will help
to avoid any keywords from (say) your journal title from showing up in
Google.
In the case of forums and reviews, any threads or posts that are
posted by a user who has opted to disallow search engines will be
omitted from the listings.
The way I detect search engines is by the User-Agent string that
is passed in with the HTTP request header. This is generally a pretty
reliable way to detect the major search engines.
Note: If your content was previously indexed by Google, and you
now want to exclude it from their index, then you should not simply
unpublish or delete the journal in question. This won't remove it from
their index. The better way is to leave the journal published, but
select 'Disallow' for your Google Policy. Then when Google next visits
your page, it will see the 'noindex' tag and remove your page from
their index, usually immediately. This is only possible if they are
actually able to load your page, though; if you simply unpublish or
delete the journal, then the Googlebot can't see the page at all, and
so your 'noindex' tag will never be seen, and the journal will just
hang around in their indexes, possibly indefinitely.
The 'Google Policy' option on the Registration and My > Account
pages allows you to set a general policy for your content. By default,
your journals, articles, classifieds, forums, reviews and profile will
follow this policy. However you can also override this policy for some
individual content. For example, if you want to allow your journals to
be indexed, but you don't want your profile to be, then you would set
your general policy to be 'Allow', and then set the policy on the
Profile page to 'Disallow'. Likewise for individual journals, and
journal pages - you can leave it at the default policy, or override it
for that particular content. You will see the 'Google policy' option
on the edit properties form for journals, and the individual page edit
forms. For individual journal pages, for example, you might want the
journal as a whole to be visible in Google, but say you have one page
which has some sensitive information - you can set the policy for just
that page to be 'Disallow'.
Finally, it's also worth noting that these options have been added
17 years into the life of the website (as of now, March 2017), during
which time Googlebot has been able to index most of the content. So,
if you have existing content, and want to remove it from Google, then
it might take a while for that to happen, since the website has
literally hundreds of thousands of pages. Unfortunately I have no
control over how often Google visits (or "crawls") individual pages on
the site. All you can really do is set the policy, and then wait for
Google to come back and see the 'noindex' tag.
Logging in and out of the website
Once you have registered, you can login by clicking on 'My' in the
navbar, or the 'Log in' link on the left hand side of
the home page. Enter your username and password, and
you can also optionally check the 'Remember me' checkbox so that your
browser will retain the cookie for future sessions (if you don't check
the box, then you will be automatically logged out at the end of the
browser session, i.e. when you close the browser). Only check this box
on a private computer, since you don't want other people to be able to
potentially come after you and use your account for mischief. Checking
the 'Remember me' checkbox means your login cookie will last for 90 days.
If you ever forget your username or password, then there is a
password reset option on the login page. You will be asked to enter
the current email address you have on your account. If you do this,
then an email is automatically sent to you with your username, and a
link which will allow you to set a new password. I can't send you your
current password, since for security it's not actually stored anywhere
in the database (you don't need to know how this works, but in case
you're curious - what I do is store a special mangled version of your
password, called a "hash", which is generated by
a cryptographic
hash function. This is one-way, so that the password cannot be
guessed from the hash, and the hash is unique, such that the chances
of two different passwords generating the same hash are extremely
low. Then when you go to log in, I simply run whatever you type in
through the same hash function, and if the resulting hash is the same
as what's in the database, then it's a match. This is a clever way of
being able to check a password without having to actually store the
password anywhere - it means if anyone managed to hack into my server
and steal the entire database, then they still wouldn't have the
passwords of all the users. This is good for you, but it does also
mean I can't send you your existing password - all we can do is reset
it to a new one).
If you have not logged in for a long while, and have both
forgotten your login and also no longer have access to the email
account that you registered with,
then contact me and I will do my best
to try to help you get back online again. It really helps if you can
at least remember what the old email address was, since this will
assist in confirming your identity to me. Please do not register again
- it's much preferable to get your existing account back online. It
would also help if you filled out one or both of the 'backup contacts'
in the registration form. I may use those to either identify you (by
having you confirm them) or else use them to actually contact you.
You can log out of the website either via the link on the left
hand side of the home page, or there is also a button on the 'My'
page. If you did not check the 'Remember me' checkbox at login time,
then you are automatically logged out when you exit your browser
(since the cookie is only remembered during the current session). If
you did check the 'Remember me' checkbox, then the browser retains
your login cookie between sessions (a "session", in this context,
starts when you start your browser, and ends when you exit the
browser). Always remember to log out of public computers, but it is
not so important on private computers that only you have access to.
Note: Some browsers have a security/privacy setting which deletes
all cookies at the end of a session, regardless of whether or not the
cookies were marked as 'persistent' (i.e. to be kept between
sessions). If you have such a setting on your browser enabled, then
the 'Remember me' option might not work for you, and you will then
have to log in anew for every new browser session.
Logging in using HTTPS
The protocol that your web browser uses to communicate with web
servers is
called http
(hypertext transfer protocol). Regular http is not secure; everything
you transmit through your browser to and from the web server could
potentially be intercepted by hackers
or other agencies. This isn't
usually a problem if you're just casually browsing, but consider what
happens when you log in to a website - your password will be
transmitted as plain text, which anybody with the right tools could
read. This is obviously not optimal, and so https was born.
Https
means http
secure. When you are on a secure page, the link in the address bar
of your browser usually starts with 'https' instead of 'http'. When
you access a website using https, everything that passes between your
browser and the website gets encrypted, so nobody in the middle can
intercept it. This means things like passwords are more secure; even
if you're using a public WiFi, nobody
can packet
sniff to intercept your information. Not all websites provide an
https option; it requires some special code on the server side in
order to enable it. Usually it just happens automatically, and you're
not aware of it (though your browser should give you some indication
when you are on a secure connection, usually using a padlock icon).
Generally there is little to no downside to enabling https. Back
in the 1990's and early 2000's computers weren't as fast, and the work
of encrypting and decrypting the http connection made things
noticeably slower, both on the client and server side. But nowadays,
most computers have ample CPU power to handle https without breaking a
sweat. You shouldn't notice much, if any, difference in speed between
regular http and https.
In order to maximize your security while using this site, I have
enabled something
called HTTP
Strict Transport Security, or HSTS. This simply tells your browser
to always connect to this website using HTTPS, rather than HTTP. So
then even if you follow a link to some page on this site that has
'http' at the front, your browser will always request the 'https'
version.
My
The 'My' section is where you can see all of your journals listed
- when you have just registered, you won't have any journals,
obviously, but you should see a 'Create journal' button. See the later
section on editing journals for more details on that process. Here we
will focus on some of the other things you can do in the 'My' page.
My > Account
This takes you back to the same form that you used to register in
the first place. It allows you to change your name, email and
password.
Please also see the section above on Real Names
vs Pseudonyms for details on the website policy for names.
My > Topics
This website is part of a network of sites which are organized
by topic. You can select which topics you are interested in
here. This will affect what topics are shown on your profile
page. To learn more about how the topics
work, click here.
My > Options
You can set some options that will be saved with your login,
and optionally you can have some of these automatically applied
whenever you log in. This can help when you're on the road, logging
in from different computers.
My > Resources
When you create Resource entries while logged in, they are
marked as belonging to you. This page is where you can see them all
in one place, so you can edit them. See the Resources section for details on how to
create Resource entries.
My > Classifieds
When you create Classified ads, they are marked as belonging to
you. This page is where you can see them all in one place, so you
can edit them. See the Classifieds
section for details on how to create classifieds.
My > Bookmarks
You can bookmark journals, forum messages, resources,
classifieds, pics, polls and user profiles. A bookmark is just a
way of keeping a pointer to a place for referencing again later. If
you bookmark a specific page in a journal, then you can continue
reading from that page later - there will be a 'Continue reading'
link on the bookmark under the 'My > Bookmarks' page.
You can order the bookmarks either chronologically (by when the
bookmark was added) or manually. There is an option for this under
'My > Options'. If you choose manual, then you can move entries up
and down in the sequence using the arrows which will appear on the
left side of the 'My > Bookmarks' page, when you enable edit mode
(there is a link near the top of the page for this). Edit mode also
lets you delete bookmarks (using the yellow trashcan over to the
right side).
If you bookmark an object that was previously already
bookmarked, then this has the effect of moving it to the top of the
bookmarks.
My > Relations
This is your list of pending relations (see Relations).
My > Ratings
This displays the list of Ratings that
you have made. You can sort it and select filters just like on the
main ratings page, but it will only show those ratings which you
have set.
My > Downloads
This is where you can schedule to have a downloadable
version of your selected journals generated.
First, go to My > Downloads and select the docs you
want from the list. You can only select published journals and
articles.
Next, select what kind of file you want. The default is zipped
files format, which can be unzipped and browsed directly
on your hard drive. However you can also select an ISO CD image
which can be burned directly to CD or DVD. Both options
contain exactly the same files; the benefit of getting the CD
image is that it is slightly easier to burn it directly to
CD. The benefit of the zipped files option is that you can
browse the journals on your hard drive. You can also burn the
unzipped files to CD if you so wish; most CD burning
applications can generate CDs from directories on your hard
drive.
If you don't have a CD burner, or even simply have a slow
internet connection, then the My > Downloads form lets you
request to have me download and burn it for you in return for
a small donation to cover my time,
materials, postage etc. If you opt for this, then fill in the
contact info portion of the form so I know where to send the
CD. The amount you send for the donation is up to you; it's
whatever you can afford, or feel is appropriate. If you are
unemployed or otherwise financially poor, then no donation (or
explanation) is necessary.
Finally, click the 'Schedule' button. This will add your
request to the job queue.
The download generation job is run automatically once an
hour. While the process is waiting to be started, you'll see a
'pending' status on the My > Downloads page. You can cancel
your request anytime during the 'pending' phase. Once the job
has started, the status is 'running'. After it is complete,
the status is 'done', and you'll be sent an automatic
notification email. At this point, you will also see a
download link for the zip file on the My > Downloads page.
Once complete, you can either click on the link in the
email to download the zipped file, or go back to My >
Downloads to get it.
Depending on the size and number of your journals, these
files can be very large (tens or even hundreds of
megabytes). It could take many hours to download on a dialup
connection, and anywhere from 1 to 30 minutes or more on cable
or DSL, depending on your speed.
The file is compressed in zip
format in order to reduce download time. You will need to
use an unzip program (such as WinZip or 7-Zip on Windows, or the
standard 'unzip' command on Linux) to decompress the file.
The filename is a random string of characters and
numbers. This is for security, to reduce the possibility of
people being able to download other users' files.
Once unzipped, if you selected the "zipped files" option,
then there will be a directory (with the same random name as
the zip file, minus the ".zip" extension), which contains the
files. In this case, you are now done, and can browse the
journals by loading 'index.html' in your browser. If you
selected the CD ISO option, then the unzipped file will be
named with a .iso extension (which may now be burned directly
onto CD or DVD).
The ISO file may be too large for a CD (max is about 700
MB). If so, then you will have to either generate a smaller
file by selecting fewer journals, or else use a DVD (max 4.7
GB).
Note that even if save your file to a DVD, this doesn't
mean it is then in video format which you can watch on TV. A
data DVD is just a larger version of a data CD. You still need
a computer and a web browser to view the journals on a data
DVD.
The resulting CD should auto-start in Windows. It should
load index.html into your default browser. If this doesn't
happen, then you will have to open index.html explicitly. From
there you can browse the journals on the CD or DVD.
Please note that if you have selected a random pic to be
displayed on your journal title page, then one will be picked
at random for the download - but since the CD is static, this
one pic is fixed thereafter. If you want a particular pic on
the title page, make sure to select it in the journal
properties form before scheduling the download.
Any embedded Google maps will be shown in the CD version
of the journal, but you will have to be online while browsing
the CD in order for them to display and be interactive. Routes
(lines) should also display correctly (as long as you're
online).
The zip file will usually be automatically deleted after
three days. If filespace on the server is becoming a problem,
then this period may be shortened without notice. You can help
keep disk usage under control by downloading promptly, and
then deleting the file yourself.
You can only have one outstanding request at a time. You
can delete an existing file by going back to My > Downloads
and clicking the 'Delete file' option. You will then be able
to start a new request.
Please do not use this feature frivolously. Building and
downloading these files is an intensive process which puts
load on the server and slows things down for everybody else.
My > Donations
This page displays all your previous donations (at least since
April 2007, which is when the database functionality for tracking
donations was implemented). Here you can see your privacy
preferences (whether your name and amount are displayed or not),
and there is a shortcut button for changing those preferences. You
can cancel Paypal subscriptions on
the donate page.
Searching the website
Here's how the Search function works on this website:
What is it: The search functionality on this
website is implemented using an
Open
Source fulltext indexing tool
named Sphinx, combined
with some special features that work outside of Sphinx and
directly on the MySQL database.
What it does: It lets you search the
user-contributed content of the website - e.g. forum posts,
journal content, classifieds, etc. In addition to simple
keyword searching, there are more sophisticated options
available which allow you to narrow down your search according
to specific criteria, depending on the type of thing you're
looking for. This enables you to look for, e.g. "all journals
with a duration of at least 7 days, which covered at least
1000 miles, with a start date in 2003", or "all forum posts by
Joe Bloggs that mention tents".
Below, I'll describe in more
detail how to do this.
Where is it: There is a search box at the top
right hand corner of every page on the site.
There are also
search boxes under the various sections of the site,
e.g. Forums, Journals, Reviews etc. And there is of course
also the "Search" tab in the main navbar, which means it is
always available with one click from wherever you are on the
site. Only the main search page has the additional options
which allow for further narrowing down the result set. So the
search boxes in other parts of the site can be used as
shortcuts to get to the main page, where you can do more
narrowing down.
How to search: You can just type some keywords and
click the 'Search' button (or hit 'Enter'). You can put
phrases (words that should appear together exactly as typed)
in double quotes. This will search the entire site for content
that contains those words. If you find that too many results
are being returned, then there are options for narrowing down
the criteria. All that will be described in detail below.
Search results: Search results are displayed 10 at a time (apparently Google
did studies which revealed that this is an optimal number),
and you can page through these up to a maximum result set size
of 1000. This maximum is there for
efficiency reasons, so that massive result sets don't use up
all the server memory. Page through the result set using the
usual 'First, 'Prev, 'Next' and 'Last' links.
Narrowing your search: If you want to search only
within certain parts of the site, e.g. just the Forums, then
use the dropdown menu to the left of the search box. Depending
on what you select, additional options may appear
automatically; for example, 'Journals' will produce another
dropdown menu with options specific to journals. There are
further options for narrowing the search, which are described
below.
Search syntax for the main search box: There is a
logical boolean syntax that you can use for searching by
keyword. Please note that some of the other fields which are
shown under "Show options" use a different syntax that is
described below (mostly for date and number ranges). I
use this type of text
for query examples. Please see
the Sphinx website if
you would like more in-depth discussion of the fulltext search
syntax (for reference, we are using v2 and RT indexes).
Boolean AND: hello & world
Boolean OR: hello | world
Operator NOT: hello -world, or alternatively !world
Grouping: (hello world)
Combined example: ( cat -dog ) | ( cat -mouse )
Phrases: "hello world" - i.e. words must appear together like that
Exact match: =hello, also works with phrases, e.g. ="hello world"
Prefix wildcards: hell* matches "hello" or "hellacious". Prefix must be at least 3 characters in length.
Infix wildcards: *world* matches "world", "worldly" or "unworldly". Infix must be at least 3 characters in length.
Proximity: Proximity distance is specified
in words, adjusted for word count, and applies to all
words within quotes. For
instance, "cat dog
mouse"~8 query means that there
must be less than 8-word span which contains all 3
words, ie. "CAT aaa bbb ccc DOG eee fff MOUSE"
document will not match this query, because this span
is exactly 8 words long.
Quorum: Quorum matching operator introduces
a kind of fuzzy matching. It will only match those
documents that pass a given threshold of given
words. So "the world is a
wonderful place"/3 will match all
documents that have at least 3 of the 6 specified
words.
Strict order operator: This will match the
document only if its argument keywords occur in the
document exactly in the query order. For instance,
black << cat
will match the document text "black and white cat" but
not "that cat was black". Order operator has the
lowest priority. It can be applied both to just
keywords and more complex expressions, for example
this is a valid query: (bag
of words) << "exact phrase" <<
red|green|blue
Field start and field end operator: The
field-start ^ and field-end $ keyword modifiers will
make the keyword match only if it occurred at the very
start or the very end of a fulltext field,
respectively. For instance, the
query "^hello
world$" (with quotes and thus combining
phrase operator and start/end modifiers) will only
match documents that contain at least one field that
has exactly these two keywords.
NEAR operator: This is a generalized
version of the proximity operator. The syntax is
NEAR/N, it is case-sensitive, and no spaces are
allowed beetwen the NEAR keyword, the slash sign, and
the distance value. The original proximity operator
only worked on sets of keywords. NEAR is more generic
and can accept arbitrary subexpressions as its two
arguments, matching the document when both
subexpressions are found within N words of each other,
no matter in which order. NEAR is left associative and
has the same (lowest) precedence as BEFORE. For
example hello NEAR/3
world NEAR/4 "my test"
Additional options: If you click on 'Show options',
situated just below the search form, then additional options
will appear (you need Javascript enabled in your browser for
this to work). Which ones appear depends on what you have
selected in the dropdown menu to the left of the main search
box, i.e. Journals, Forums, Reviews etc. Each of these areas
has its own context, for example 'start date' is relevant for
journals, but not forum posts, so it only appears if
'Journals' is selected in the main dropdown. I'll list all the
fields below - just be aware that the fields may not show up
unless you have the appropriate area of the site selected for
searching.
Sort by: You can select to sort the results
by one of several choices, e.g. date (relevant mostly
to forum posts), hitcount (relevant to journals only),
review stars (relevant to reviews), or the various
rating scores (greatread, greatpics, funny etc). The
default is "relevance", which lets Sphinx choose the
ordering based on its matching algorithms.
Pics: You have the option of including only
pics in the search results, or excluding them
entirely. The default is "no preference".
Pic type: If you are looking for pics, then
you can opt to look for images, files or maps. The
default is "no preference".
Caption: Matches keywords against pic
captions, using the same syntax rules as the main
query field.
Filename: Look for a particular pic
filename.
Title: Matches keywords against the
document title. This obviously varies according to the
type of object, but usually roughly approximates to
the html heading for pages on the site. This might be
useful if you want to restrict the search to only
looking at title text.
Content: Matches keywords against the page
content. This might be useful if you want to exclude
the title, captions or other types of text in the
index. Basically looks at the body of the page.
Author: Matches keywords against the
author(s) of the documents in the index. For journals,
this can be more than one name. For forum posts etc it
is just one name usually. You can use the same syntax
rules as apply to the main query box, same as with all
the keyword-based fields.
Username: This is like the author field,
but more specific since usernames are more unique than
real names. It might be useful when someone has a very
common name, but you want to make sure you are only
getting content by that person. The username is
visible on the person's profile page, in the heading
after their real name.
Ratings: This matches keywords against the
ratings which have been applied to pages on the
site. It's important to note that you need to enter
words that exactly match the rating words that are in
the database. The set of ratings includes the
following words:
interesting, agree, disagree, useful, insightful, inspiring, funny, greatpics, greatread, miscategorized, offtopic, troll, abuse, spam.
You can also optionally search for ranges of rating
scores, e.g. greatread>5
funny>=3. The rule here is that there
must be no space between the rating, the operator and
the number. The operator is one of the usual, namely
<, <=, =, >=, and >. If you do not give any number,
then the keywords are matched by Sphinx's fulltext
search, and the results should come back ordered
approximately by rating score, i.e. if you look
for funny,
then the first results should be those pages that have
the biggest funny scores.
Categories: This matches keywords against
categories. For forums, the category is matched
against the name of the forum. For journals,
classifieds and resources, it matches against the
categories for those areas of the site.
Features: This is only relevant to the
resources and classifieds; it matches keywords against
the features, which are the sub-category checkboxes
which you see on the edit forms for those objects.
Locales: This will match keywords against
any locales that have been set for object type you
have selected. Currently it is only really relevant
for journals, journal pages, journal pics, and
resources & classifieds. In the future, more areas of
the site may gain locales, e.g. the forums, but not
yet.
URL: For resources, this lets you search
within just the 'home page' field (i.e. the link to
the resource). Since Sphinx splits text up by
punctuation, parts of the url that are separated by
periods etc can be searched using discrete keywords,
e.g. if the link goes to example.com, then you can
just look
for example,
or if you want to find all resources which link to
parks.ca.gov (i.e. parks in California), then you
might look for parks ca
gov, or, if you really want to make sure
of the ordering then you could use the strict ordering
operator (described
above): parks << ca <<
gov.
Contact: For resources and classifieds,
this lets you search by keyword within the address and
contact fields.
Handle: This lets you look for a particular
handle, which is only relevant for journals and users
(the username is also known as the user's handle).
Keywords: This matches against the keywords
which the author set for their journal, if any. Note
that this is only relevant to journals.
Years: This matches keywords against the
years which journal authors have defined for their
journal. Currently this is just a simple keyword
field, there is no ability to specify ranges (since
the field can be multi-value, ranges would be
difficult given the way the index works). Years should
be given in four digit format, separated by spaces.
When: This is a dropdown menu giving you
the option to only look at past, present or future
journals. The start and end dates of the journals are
used to determine the state, relative to now. So for
example if a journal's start date is in the past, and
the end date is in the future, then it must currently
be in progress, and is classified as a "now"
journal. Likewise if both the start date and end date
are in the past, then it is a "past" journal. And if
the start date is in the future, then it is a "future"
journal. This option obviously only applies to
journals; if you select it, then you are implicitly
restricting your search to journals only.
Completed: This gives you the option of
looking only for journals which have been marked as
"completed" by the author, or excluding those. This
only applies to journals and articles.
Featured: This lets you look only for
journals and articles that have been featured on the
front page of the site (or, if you want, you can
exclude those from your search).
Duration: This allows you to search
journals by duration (in days). That value is
calculated whenever the journal is updated by the
author, based on the start and end dates. You can
enter just numbers, or optionally range operators just
before the number (one of the usual
<,<=,=,>=,>). There must be no space between the
operator and the number, and numbers must be separated
by spaces. For
example: >7
<=20
Total distance: This lets you search for
journals by total distance (as recorded by the author
so far). The syntax rules are the same as for
duration, see above. You should also make sure you
select the appropriate distance units (miles or
km). This field only applies to journals.
Page distance: Individual pages in journals
can have an optional distance; this lets you search
based on those values. The syntax rules are the same
as for 'total distance' and 'duration', above. Make
sure you select the appropriate distance units (miles
or km).
Distance units: Some people talk in miles,
others talk in km. Select whichever is your
preference, and this will determine how the numbers
you enter in the 'total distance' or 'page distance'
fields are interpreted.
Date: This applies to anything that can
have a date associated, but the date has different
meaning based on the context. For forum and guestbook
posts, it refers to the date of posting for that
message. For journal tables of contents, it's the same
as the start date. For journal pages, it's the date
entered for the page (if any) by the author. For pics,
it is the date on the page or posting where the pic
lives. For classifieds and resources, it's the date
when the entry was created. You can apply operators to
the dates to make ranges, e.g. less than this date,
after this date etc. There must be no space between
the operator and the date. There are five ways for
specifying dates: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY, MM, or
MM-DD. So in other words you can specify a specific
day (YYYY-MM-DD), or a month in a particular year
(YYYY-MM), or the year (YYYY), or just the given month
in any year (MM), or a given day of a given month in
any year (MM-DD). It's important to note the format
(separate the digits by hyphens) and the number of
digits that is required for this to work, i.e. four
digits for year, two digits for month, and two digits
for day. Also the ordering is important, so year must
come before month, which comes before day. For
example: >=2001
<2002-05, or to search for anything
during the month of April (any year), you would just
put 04.
Start date: This only applies to journals,
and it allows you to search based on the
author-specified start date. Syntax is the same as
that described above for 'date'.
End date: This allows you to search based
on a specific date, or ranges of values for the
journal end date. The syntax rules are the same as for
'date', see above.
Hitcount: This lets you search for journals
and articles based on ranges of numeric values that
follow the same syntax rules as 'duration', described
above. For example:
>10000 <20000
Review stars: This lets you look for
reviews based on the star rating they have
received. The syntax follows the same numeric range
rules as was described above for the 'duration' field,
described above. For obvious reasons, this only
applies to the reviews portion of the website.
Average review stars: Individual reviews
have a star rating, and all these ratings are averaged
out for each review thread. For example, if a thread
has three reviews, each one having 2, 3 and 4 stars,
then the average rating will be 3 stars. This field
lets you search based on that value, which takes into
account more than just a single review. The numeric
range syntax is the same as that specified above for
'duration'.
Number of reviews: This lets you specify
criteria for the number of reviews in the threads you
want to see. For example, to say that you only want to
see review threads with at least 3 rated reviews, you
would put: >=3
here. The syntax is the same as that described above
for 'duration'.
Thread starters only? This is a checkbox
that allows you to specify that you only want to look
for forum and guestbook messages which are thread
starters (i.e. they are not in reply to any other
message, and are starting a new thread). This may be
useful if you only want to look for the original
question in any given thread, rather than all the
discussion that follows after it.
Direct replies: This lets you specify
numeric ranges for the number of replies to a forum or
guestbook message. The syntax follows the usual rules
that were introduced above for 'duration'. This field
may be useful if you are wanting to limit your search
to messages that have had replies (or no replies if
you specify zero).
Thread size: This allows you to set
criteria for the total number of messages in forum or
guestbook threads. The syntax is the same as for other
fields that allow numeric ranges - see 'duration'
above for an explanation.
Refining your search: After you search, the
additional search options will be hidden again by default. You
can reveal them again by clicking on 'Show options', then all
the criteria which you entered previously should still be
there. You can then tweak these, or add new criteria, and do
the search again.
Starting over: If you ever want to start over from
scratch with a clean search slate, then just click the 'Reset'
link which is to the right of the main search box.
Freshness: The search index is updated every
minute, so any change to the journals, forums etc should be
reflected pretty quickly in the search results.
Availability: The whole index may need to be
regenerated from scratch occasionally, due to the fact that
some fragmentation can occur due to updates. This is a side
effect of the way Sphinx is implemented - it favors speed of
indexing and searching, at the expense of some internal data
fragmentation (this doesn't affect the quality of the
searches, but it could result in more memory consumption and
slower speed). While the index is being built, the search
function on the website will still work, but it will be
sub-optimal (due to the index being incomplete) - if you try
to do searches during this time, you'll see a message to that
effect. Regeneration of the index from scratch usually takes
on the order of an hour or two, and should be relatively
infrequent.
Problems? If you have any problems with the search
function, then please don't hesitate to let me know - the best
way to do this is to click the 'Report' link, which is at the
very bottom of the page of search results (or lack
thereof). If you do this, then I should receive as part of
your message a link which will allow me to repeat your search
on my end. Being able to reproduce problems is a major part of
being able to fix things quickly, so please use 'Report' on
the search results page to help me see what you tried. Just to
re-emphasise: It's important that you need to click 'Report'
on the results page, i.e. right after you execute the
problem search, otherwise I won't get the right link with your
search parameters.
Editing Your Own Journals and Articles
If you'd like to skip this introduction and get straight into how
to creating your own journal, then see the Editing Quick-Start.
This website allows you to create and edit your own journals,
complete with table of contents, pics and guestbook (message
board). For a good example of what can be accomplished, see the
original Crazy Guy On A
Bike tour diary. This section is a tutorial on how you can do this
yourself.
First of all, don't be intimidated by the apparent size of this
help document. Creating and editing your own journal really isn't all
that hard - I just tried to be really comprehensive with the Help
documentation. I have actually put quite a lot of thought into making
the whole thing as simple and easy-to-use as possible, while still
retaining the powerful features required for editing documents
online. In a nutshell, if you know how to use browser forms then it
will be a piece of cake. And if you have any problems, then just get in touch
with me!
Why publish?
So why would you want to publish your journal online at all? Well, first of all it gives you a great sense of closure about your trip. You feel like you have done it justice somehow, by showing the world what you did. It was, after all, a fantastic achievement! It doesn't matter if it was a one day fun ride, or a two year epic - all journals hold a special fascination for other people. We all love reading about journeys and parts of the world which we may only dream of visiting. So you are also giving something to the world - taking your (perhaps solitary) experience and making it into a shared one. You'll probably make new contacts with people as they leave messages in your journal guestbook, and who knows - you may even meet your next tour buddy in these pages. Putting your journal online is a pure contribution to the world of literature - free, unfettered by real-world publishing constraints and profit margins. The second you make your journal visible, anyone around the world with internet access can read it. And if that doesn't blow your mind, then nothing will...
The other nice thing about doing all this online is that you can write the journal as you are actually doing the trip! For example, on any of the major tours in the USA (even the offroad ones) you will pass through towns, and every fair sized town has a library. And most libraries these days have internet
access. Since everything is done via the Web browser, it doesn't matter where you are geographically. You could be in Botswana, or New Jersey, or the Alps. Your friends and family (and the rest of the world) can keep up with your latest adventures. You might only edit the text initially, then go back and add the pictures once you're at home. It's up to you! Oh, and you can even post entries via email.
I have found that the more personal you can be in your journal, the better. People seem to really appreciate it when you bare your soul and express what was really going on in your head when you saw that mountain, fought off that bear or had dinner with that tribe. So don't be afraid to reveal very personal thoughts, doubts, trepidations, silly fantasies, fears, delights and gastro-intestinal episodes. It's much more interesting to read about that than a lot of dry stuff along the lines of "then we went here, then we went there, then we camped here"... don't worry about being witty or intellectual. We can't all be Mark Twain. You'd be surprised once you actually sit down and start writing, most of the time a lot more happened than you first thought. Tour journals pretty much write themselves. For this reason, it's very important that you keep notes on your trip AS YOU DO IT. Don't wait until after the end of your tour, because so much happens that you will forget all the things that make a journal interesting - little thoughts, random musings and incidents that are quickly forgotten in the rush. Keep a paper diary, or use one of those electronic organizers (I used a Psion). I am even considering taking a small, electronic voice recorder with me next time, because there are times when all you want to do is record a random thought - and it's much easier to just speak. Plus, you can record distances and events without having to stop and write things down. It's ok to commit it all to your written journal at the end of each day, but wait much longer than that and the memories will be crowded out by all the new experiences. You won't regret it later - even though the last thing you generally feel like at the end of a long day is sitting down and writing about it!
Finally, try to remember to take pictures. You wouldn't believe some of the times I just stood there and gawked, completely forgetting to record some priceless scene or other...
Carsen Hoefer wrote an excellent article with some advice on writing a good journal that people will want to read - see A Style Guide for Touring Cyclists for some great tips.
Rules of Posting
RULES FOR POSTING JOURNALS AND ARTICLES
NOTE: DO NOT SKIP READING THIS SECTION! These are not casual rules. If you ignore any of them, then you may find your journal (or even your user account) deleted without notice.
Human powered bicycle tours and related articles ONLY. This means the main mode of travel must be by human-powered bicycle (i.e. no electric or gasoline-powered motors on the bike), and articles must be related to bicycle touring. Do not post accounts of other non-cycling trips you've done here - the more general travel topic is the place for trips using other modes of transport. The focus here is specifically on bicycle touring, not racing, or commuting, or even just bicycles in general. This is not the place to post e-bike journals.
No commercials. It's ok to talk about gear and other products, but these views must be honest, unprompted and non-compensated opinions from real consumers who have no connection to the company in question. If you want to post a more in-depth consumer review of a product, then a better place to do it is in the Reviews section. If you are a company that wants to promote your product, then you are welcome to post a Resource entry (assuming, of course, that it is relevant to bicycle touring). Note that resource entries can be quite long enough (with embedded pictures) to describe a product in some depth.
No multi-trip journals. The journals on this site have been designed to have a single start and end date; each tour journal should be about one trip. Please do not attempt to combine trips that span multiple years into one big journal. You will be asked to split it up.
No constant plugging of charities. Sponsored rides are fine, and it's certainly ok to talk about the charity that you are riding for on one page of your journal. But it's annoying to have cookie-cutter plugs, links and pleas on every page. Don't turn your journal into an advertisement. It should be about the bicycle touring, not the charity.
This is not a "blog" website. A blog is an ongoing daily stream of posts with no real beginning or end. The journals on this website have been designed to work more like books, with a definite beginning and end. Journals should be articles about touring, or else actual tours. Ongoing blogs of everyday life are discouraged, even if they are ostensibly about bicycles or training for a tour. The reason for this is that such blogs have a way of inevitably veering off-topic into being about everyday life at home, which is not what this website is supposed to be about. Of course there is a large degree of creative flexibility within real tour journals and articles - you can post events, experiences and other stuff as it relates to your tour or bicycle touring in general, but please keep the family photo album/blog somewhere else!
This is not a photo dump. Journals should have real text content, not just page after page of uploaded photos with no commentary. This is not flickr, if all you want is a photo gallery then please use some other place to host that. While pics are a very important part of any journal, they are not a substitute for real narrative. People come here to read actual journals, so please think about this - the reason you're here right now wanting to post something is because of the reputation the site has gained - this has become valuable through the quality content that others have posted. You want to help keep that standard high, right? Obviously post all the good/worthwhile pics that are relevant to the journal, but I'm just saying, show some restraint when it comes to the hundreds and thousands of pics that can spew out of modern digital cameras.
This is not the place for Religion or Politics. If you have an urge to write about your religious faith, or get on a soapbox about your political worldview, then please do it elsewhere. Many people are irritated by this sort of stuff, and while some talk of your personal beliefs is ok in the proper context, it shouldn't dominate the flavor of the journal.
All relevant text and pics must be posted in the journal proper, not as links to your other blog or photo album. Journals and articles should be real, honest, original and complete content, not links to other blogs, or advertisements for businesses or services. Links to third party sites that come up naturally in the course of the narrative are ok (e.g. if you're discussing a tent you used, then posting a link to the manufacturer website is fine - but be warned, astroturfing and any other form of stealth marketing will get you banned). Please do not post journals that are partial rehashes or summaries of blogs that already exist elsewhere, with links for "the rest" of the text or pics. If you'd like to have a link to your pre-existing website, then please feel free to use the Resources. Finally, journals with pics that have a website address as a
watermark (i.e. text superimposed on the image, usually in one corner) risk being removed immediately. It's ugly, and it makes your journal feel like a promotional vehicle even if you don't have any other links in the text.
Journals must be complete and original content. This is a site for complete works, not fragments, stubs or "tasters". If I see a journal that leads off-site for "the rest of the pics" or "click here for the full journal" etc, then that journal and/or account may be unpublished or removed. If you post a journal or article here, then it must be complete in terms of content - i.e. all relevant text and pics. Journals must also be your own, original content.
Please try to minimize constantly linking to other sites for content that could be posted in the journal proper. For example, map/routing sites related to posting trip data. This website has sophisticated built-in maps based on the Google Maps API, where you can plot routes and upload GPX, KML etc files etc. There are also features such as elevation profiles and annotated markers. If every page on your journal refers off-site to some ephemeral web page that probably won't be around in 10 years, then the journal will eventually become crippled and incomplete due to "link rot". Please use features on this website where they exist to compose your journal content, rather than linking off-site. Note: This isn't a ban on links off-site! It's just a plea to use the integrated features available here wherever possible, so that journals don't turn into fragmented linkfests. A big exception here includes video: It is ok to link to youtube videos, since I do not host video here, and I have special code to convert simple youtube links to embedded videos. But for most mapping/routing purposes, please consider using the maps here - they are integrated with the rest of this website, and are shown embedded (i.e. you see the map right there in the journal, no need to click on anything).
If you are re-posting a journal that already exists on your blog somewhere else, then this is ok in principle; I don't mind if the journal exists elsewhere, and I don't even mind if you post a link to it somewhere (not everywhere). The big requirement in this case, though, is that you must post the entire journal - not just snippets, not tasters with links to your blog for the rest of the content, or the pics, or whatever. The big requirement is that journals must be COMPLETE. I make an exception for stuff like videos, which are usually posted on youtube, linking to those is fine, as are links to third party websites like Wikipedia. But for regular journal content created by you, i.e. text and pics, all of that must be posted here.
No huge, single page journals. It is not ok to simply cut and paste an entire Word document (or blog) into one big page and then publish it. You can by all means copy from an existing source, but please split it up as appropriate to fit the page structure of the journals.
Journals (and user accounts) may be removed without notice if they violate any of these rules, or contain inappropriate or off-topic content. The webmaster also reserves the right to edit journals as needed. Generally, small and obvious errors (typos etc) may be corrected without notifying the journal author; larger issues will be raised with the author via email. The webmaster's decision is final.
Read the instructions on how journals are supposed to be structured and use the tools to create a journal correctly. Please take the time to read the Help, which contains full instructions for using the journal editing tools.
Editing Quick Start
Here is a quick overview for those of you who really hate reading
user manuals. First thing, register
and login(you can do both by clicking on the 'My'
link in the top navbar). Once you're logged in, you'll see a button
to create a new journal; click
that and you'll get a form where you fill out the name of the journal,
description, etc. If you're wondering about specific aspects of any
form you come across, click on the Help! link and you'll be taken to
the relevant section in this document.
Once you've created the new journal, you'll see the title page and
(empty) table of contents. Click on
the
Edit option in the navbar,
and this takes you to the page where you
can add pages to your journal. So, just
go to it! Add pages, re-order them,
and upload pictures. Any time you
need help, click the Help! link for the form. It should all be pretty
straightforward. When you're logged in and looking at one of your
journals, you'll always see the orange editing options prominently
displayed. Have fun!
Creating A New Journal
You create a journal or article by clicking on the 'Create new
journal or article' button, which is displayed on the 'My' page. Next
you have to choose what it is you want to create - a trip journal, or
article. After this, you're on the journal properties form - see the
next section on Editing
Properties for how that page works. Before that, though, it's
worth getting the big picture about how the journals are supposed to
be structured. The next few paragraphs give a brief overview of this.
Journals and articles consist of a number of pages,which
you create individually from the Table of Contents.
To add pages to your journal, simply go to the Table of Contents
and click on Edit in the navigation bar. This takes you to the Edit
Contents page, where you'll see an Add Page button.
A good journal or article has an introduction, which tells
the reader something about the author's motivations. Other good
sections include equipment lists, overviews of the
country/region which you passed through (for travel journals), and
perhaps other information which would help someone else who was
thinking about doing the same thing. Finally, it's always nice to have
some kind of conclusion, with the insights, spiritual
enlightenment, lawsuits etc gained from your experiences.
If your journal is about a trip, then you should try to
have one page per travel day, because each page can have its
own Date and Distance. Set these for travel days, just
leave them for non travel days. All the pages with a distance are
summed up in the Table of Contents to show the total distance
for the journal.
You can give different heading styles to your pages,
including the size and the indent. These styles apply
only to the Table of Contents, and help to format it like a normal
book's contents page. Try to avoid making all your pages one size and
indent. A good style guide is to use 'medium' sized headings at indent
1 for main chapter headings, and 'small' at indent 2 for travel
days. Take a look at the original
journal, Crazy Guy on a
Bike for an example.
Pictures help! Try to include lots of pictures, if you have
them. It makes the journal more fun to read and gives the reader a
much better sense of where you were (and who you are). You can add
pictures from the Edit Page form.
The system has been designed for one trip per journal, with
a single start and end date.
Editing Properties
This form is the first one you see when you are creating a new
journal or article - you set things like the title, dates and
description. You will also go back to it later to publish your journal
and mark it as "complete". To get back here once you've created your
journal, just go to the journal's Table of Contents and click on
'Edit', then 'Properties' in
the navbar. Next we take a look at the
fields on this form:
Type
This can be either 'Journal' or 'Article'. The difference is that
a journal is about any sequence of events that happened in real time
(e.g. a trip or project), whereas an article is not time-specific, and
is usually more of an informational or reference piece, e.g. an
article on how to make something, or about a particular region
etc. This is really a categorization choice - the functionality for
journals and articles is identical.
Title & Description
The Journal Properties include things such as the title and
description of the journal. For example, in my first journal the title
was "Crazy Guy On A Bike", and the description was "A Personal Account
Of A Bicycle Ride Across America During The Long, Hot Summer of
1998". You should choose a title and description which evoke something
of your spirit and character, and also what the trip was all
about. It's probably a good idea to mention something about where the
trip went geographically, if it is a travel journal.
Keywords
This optional property allows you to enter a list of keywords or
phrases which you think should be associated with your journal. This
text will be included in the Journal Index and on your Table Of
Contents page, and it will be picked up by any search engine robot
which visits the site. So, if you would like to increase your
journal's visibility to search engines then you should think about
good keywords relevant to your trip. You might, for example, put
something like "bicycle tour journal diary personal account camping
solo". Try to think about all the keywords which people might type
into search engines, which you would like to result in your journal
popping up. Please only put relevant keywords, to preserve the site's
integrity with search engines. The site already enjoys a high ranking
on Yahoo!
and Google,
and we want to maintain this, so any inappropriate keywords will be
removed immediately by the webmaster.
Note: You will be
assigning categories (from the Journal Index) to your journal before
publishing. The journal categories include things like region
(country, US states), year (1998, 1999 etc) and special interest
(recumbent, trike, tandem etc). The journal categories are used to
browse the journal index. You will set whichever categories are
appropriate. Most journals will probably have multiple categories, for
example "USA, 1998, TransAmerica". New categories are created on an
as-needed basis, so if you have an idea for an interesting new
category, then contact me. The main point here is that you don't need to put
keywords which will also be automatically displayed in your category
list. If you put keywords like "USA" then this will be redundant,
because it will certainly also be in the categories list. So, try to
think about keywords which more uniquely identify your journal, and
steer away from country and state names. Regions like "The Canadian
Rockies" and "Pacific Northwest" are ok, because they are more
descriptive. If you like, you can always publish your journal, and
then wait and see what categories are available before deciding on
your keywords. In a nutshell, only put keywords that don't appear
anywhere else in your journal title page.
Handle
The handle is just a name which you can associate with the journal
so that you can go directly to it using a URL of the form www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/handle. So, for example if
you chose the handle "mytrip" then you could use www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/mytrip to go directly to your
journal. This is just a convenience; it makes the URL easier to
remember and pass to your friends. Handles are unique to a journal, so
you need to think of a handle which is not already being used by
another journal. Handles are not case sensitive, and can contain
letters, numbers and hyphens. You should not use your username as a
journal handle, because it is reserved as a special handle which takes
people to your "author page", which displays your bio (which you
entered when you registered) and lists all your journals. Of course,
you also can't select a handle which is already in use by another
journal. You also cannot use an existing username (including your
own).
Authors
You can specify multiple authors for your journal. You enter a
list of login usernames (not real names), separated by spaces. So,
each author needs to register separately and get their own
username. This is useful for groups and husband-wife teams. Each
author will be able to edit the journal if they are logged in
separately. The authors will be displayed as a list, on the Table of
Contents page and the Journal Index.
You can also have non-attributed 'editor' users in the author
list. This means users who are to have edit ability for the journal,
but are not to be attributed as full authors on the title page. This
might be useful for people who are on the road and want friends or
family to be able to edit the journal, but not clutter up the title
page as full co-authors.
To add a user as an editor, just put their username in the
'Authors' field, same as usual, but then put an asterisk (*) directly
after the username, with no space. So if you are user xxx and you want
to enable user yyy to be an editor on the journal, you'd put this in
the authors field:
xxx yyy*
Then you won't see any difference on the title page, but user yyy
will now be able to edit your journal. The journal also appears on
yyy's 'My' page list of journals (but not on their public profile).
Start Date & End Date
You can specify a start date and end date for your journal. This
is useful information which is displayed in the Journal Index. You
don't need to set these dates, so you can leave them at the defaults
of 0000-00-00 if you like. Or, you can just set the start date - then
the assumption is that you started the trip but the end date is not
yet known - i.e. the trip is going on currently. You should set the
start and end dates if your journal is about a trip, but it's not
usually necessary for articles.
Years
Enter the calendar years which your journal will cover, if
applicable (not necessary for articles, unless the article is about
some specific time period). Use the full four numbers for each year,
e.g. 2020, and separate multiple years with spaces.
Distance Units
You can specify whether you want to count distance in miles or
kilometers. You will see that you can enter the distance covered on
your travel days. This is summed up so that the total distance of your
tour can be displayed with the journal. If you change units, then any
existing distances in your journal will be automatically converted
between miles and kilometers.
Page Locales Format
You can set a default format for how locales are displayed on
pages in your journal (see the Page
Locales section for details). It's pretty safe to just leave this
for now, you can always come back later and change it.
Enable Guestbook
Every journal or article gets its own guestbook, which is a
message board where people can leave comments and feedback for
you. This is one of the most interesting and useful aspects of
publishing - most people want feedback to their work, words of
encouragement and so on; so you are normally strongly urged to leave
this on. However, the option is there in case you have some good
reason to want to suppress feedback - for example, if you are being
stalked by someone who is repeatedly posting abusive or mischievous
messages or disclosing embarrassing personal information about
you. Remember that this is really a last resort - you can always
delete individual messages from your guestbook yourself (by clicking
on the yellow trashcan at the top of the message - it looks like
this: ), and report abuse to
the webmaster, who can take care of most situations. You can turn your
guestbook on or off without erasing any existing messages - it simply
makes it visible or not, it does not delete whatever was posted
previously.
Guestbook Notifications
You can opt to have any messages posted in your journal guestbook
(message board) automatically forwarded to you via email. Thus you can
just hit "reply" on your email client and reply to the person directly
- or, you can reply to them on the message board instead. It all
depends on whether you want to have a private discussion via email
with the person, or prefer to keep your message board lively by
responding to people there. As a general rule, people keep coming back
to the more active message boards, especially when there is an
interesting person driving the discussion and replying to posts. In
the case of your journal, that person will probably be you - answering
questions about your trip and possibly expanding on your
narrative. So, try to answer guestbook emails on the website, rather
than through private email, unless it really is a private
conversation.
The email option is also useful if you finish your journal and go
off to do other things - you'll automatically know if someone is
leaving comments, without having to manually go in and check every
day.
Enable Ratings
Uncheck this box if you don't wish to participate in
the ratings system for your journal or
article. If in doubt, leave this checked. Please note that even if you
uncheck this box, then the basic ratings for flagging abuse, spam etc
will still be displayed (these are only used to notify me of
inappropriate content that needs action).
Enable "Links to this"
The relations feature on this website
makes it easy to see where other people have linked to your journal or
article. If there are such incoming links, then they are shown at the
bottom of the journal, under an expandable "Links to this"
heading. Some people don't like having this displayed on their
journal, so I added an option to disable the display. Usually you
should just leave this checked, since it's often useful and
interesting to see where else people have been referring to your
journal.
Single Page
Some journals or articles are quite short, and so the usual
separate table of contents / title page seems a little cumbersome. For
such cases, where there might be only one or two pages of content,
there is the option to have it all displayed on a single page. This
means that on the title page, instead of there being just the table of
contents, below this there is the actual content. You should not check
this box for cases where there will be more than a page or two,
otherwise it will be very long and slow to download for readers.
Email Password
If you plan to use the emailing
updates feature, then you should set a password for your journal
here, so that you don't need to pass your login password in plain text
via email (that's a security risk). So choose any old password here,
and use that in your email updates to authenticate yourself. It's safe
because this password is only used to authenticate email updates; it
cannot be used to log in. Obviously you should make it something
different from your login password, but it doesn't have to be very
high security, since it's being passed in plain text anyway. Mostly
it's useful to stop spammers from posting on the journals.
Title Picture
You can optionally select any previously uploaded picture in the
journal to be displayed on the title page (the table of
contents). This can be a nice way to give a quick flavor of your trip,
so you should choose an interesting, attractive image that will be
likely to draw people into the narrative. The displayed image
automatically has a link to the page where that picture lives. All you
need to do here is enter the filename; for example, myphoto.jpg. You
can always leave this initially and then come back to the
Edit/Properties page later to set a photo which you've uploaded to one
of the pages in the journal.
If you would like to display a random picture from your journal on
the title page, then just enter 'random' in this field (without the
quotes).
Publish
You can keep your journal private while you are editing it, if you
like. Until you Publish, only you can see it (when you're logged
in). Then, when you're ready for the world to read your opus, just go
back into the Edit Properties form and check the "Publish" box. You're
free to publish (or un-publish) whenever you like; you can wait until
it's all finished, or let people read along as you do it. A great
example of this is when you update your journal from the road -
dynamically updated journals which are being posted as the trip
happens are very exciting to follow, and are encouraged! It's up to
you. Just please try to avoid publishing "test" journals, which don't
have any real content.
Google Policy
This affects whether or not Google will be allowed to index your
journal or article. See the main Google
Policy section for more details.
Completed
Once your journal is finished, you should mark it as
"completed". This doesn't really have any functional significance -
you can still edit your journal after it's been marked as
completed. This is simply a visual cue for people browsing the Journal
Index - they can see "at a glance" what state journals are in. So
people will see that your journal is a "Work in progress" if it's not
done yet, and they won't be as mystified if your account is
unfinished.
Update timestamp
Sometimes you want to edit your journal without it popping to
the top of the main journal index. So, if you leave this box
unchecked, then your journal won't be pushed to the top. This
allows you to do minor editing and tweaks without annoying people
who keep seeing your journal at the top of the list, with only tiny
changes.
The checkbox will be checked, unchecked or disabled by default
based on the following rules:
For journals of trips in progress, it is checked by default.
Emailed updates always automatically behave as if the box was
checked, unless you add 'update_timestamp = 0' to the options at
the start of the email.
For completed journals and articles, it is unchecked by default.
For all others, it is checked if the last update was more than
a day ago; otherwise it is unchecked. This encourages journals
which are being actively edited to show up on the main index at
least once a day, but not stay up there all day based on dozens of
tiny edits.
If the journal or article is not a current tour in progress,
then it can go to the top of the main index at most 3 times per day. After that, the checkbox will be
disabled. NOTE: This means that for articles, if you check the "update timestamp" checkbox more than 3 times in any 1 day period, then the box will become disabled.
Together, these rules make sure that journals being edited can
pop to the top of the main index, but not annoy people by staying
up there all day long as someone makes dozens of small changes.
Editing Categories
Before you can publish your journal you will need to set
categories for it. These are the categories which make up the Journal
Index. You can do this by going to your Table of Contents, and
clicking on "Edit". Then you will see options for editing Properties
and Categories. When you select this option you'll see a long list of
indented categories, with checkboxes. Simply select all the relevant
categories and click "Save".
There are some conventions which must be followed - you'll get an
error message with instructions on how to correct it if you don't get
it right first time. Also, there are certain categories which aren't
really intended to be set themselves - they are mostly "placeholders"
for organizing the hierarchy of categories. These categories are
displayed in italics, and you shouldn't usually select them. Of
course, sub-categories which are under placeholders are candidates for
selection.
Journal Categories are created by the webmaster on an as-needed
basis. If you find that a category doesn't exist or you have an idea
for a whole new category, then please contact me and I'll
add it.
Editing Locales
To learn about locales, see the Locales
section. This form allows you to associate locales with the journal as
a whole. These are then displayed on the title page, along with the
journal categories.
How to add locales
Go to the journal's title page (where the table of contents is). You can do this usually by going to 'My', then clicking on the journal in question.
Click 'Edit' up in the navbar near the top of the page.
Click 'Locales' subtab in the same navbar.
Click 'Add new locale' button.
Now you have a choice: You can either search for a locale by name, or click down through the hierarchy below the form to find your locale.
If you want to search by name, then just enter the name of a town, state or country (there are distinct fields for each).
When you search, then you'll get a list of matches. Click the one you want, and it'll be added to your list.
If you use the drill-down method, then just click down through the world region, country and state levels until you reach the one you want, then click 'Select [name]' button at the top, where [name] is the name of the current locale.
When you have selected a locale, then you should be returned to the main locales editing form, and the one you just selected should now be listed in the box.
Now you can either add more, using 'Add another locale' button as before, or you can re-order the list (select a line in the box and then click 'move up' or 'move down'), or remove a locale, or clear the list and start afresh.
When you are done, click 'Finished' and you're done.
The locale editing form is pretty straightforward once you get the
hang of it. If you ever get confused or lost during the selection
process, then don't panic - you can always get out by clicking on
'Contents' up in the navbar to exit the process completely. Then you
can start again.
Note: Don't use the 'Back' button on your browser to correct
mistakes. The 'Back' button doesn't mix well with forms, since it was
designed for simple static HTML pages. With forms, you're dealing with
dynamic updates to a database, and the browser doesn't know how to
'undo' something that's already been done. All it knows is how to go
back to the previous page, and this doesn't make any sense when a form
action has already been executed. For example, say you're deleting
something. You click the 'Submit' button on the form, and this
initiates a real action on the server, which deletes the thing you're
editing from the database. After that has been done, what would
clicking 'Back' mean? You can't undo what has been done - it's already
been deleted. So, always use the links and options that are visible on
the form to go 'forward', never use the 'Back' button. This is only
when you're dealing with a multi-step form process, obviously - other
places on the site, where you're not editing or doing something using
a form, the 'Back' button is fine to use.
There are guidelines on the form for how to go about choosing
which locales you should set. A good rule of thumb is to limit the
number of locales to no more than 10 to 20 at the most. This is simply
to stop clutter. Remember that this is supposed to be an overview of
what locations your journal covered, rather than a detailed
account. You can set detailed locales on the individual journal
pages. It's mostly common sense: For a multi-country world tour, you'd
probably just set the countries you passed through, since there may be
a fair number of those. For a coast-to-coast ride across the USA, you
would set the country and the states you went through. For a more
local ride within one or two states or provinces, you could be a bit
more detailed and list either counties or major towns. And so
on... just follow the rough rule of thumb that if you are selecting
more than 10-20 locales or so then you may want to be a little less
detailed.
Once you have set locales for your journal, people will be able to
find it by browsing the Journals by
Locale index.
Obviously if your journal or article has no geographical
component, then you can skip this form altogether.
Edit Contents
You get to this screen by logging in and going to your journal
Table of Contents. Then click on the "Edit" option in the navbar at
the top of the page.
Adding Pages To Your Journal
The "Edit Contents" page allows you to add pages to your journal,
and edit existing ones. You can move pages up and down in the
ordering, and change their indent in the table of contents. When you
click on a page, you're taken to the Edit form for that page. When
you're finished editing, click on the 'Done' link.
Sequence
This determines the ordering of the pages in your
journal. Sequences always start at one. To add a page to the end of
your journal, you just choose the next sequence number after the last
page. Since the most common action is to add a page on to the end of
the journal, this is conveniently automatically filled in for you in
the "Add new page" form. You can also choose to insert a page
somewhere in the middle of your journal: Just see where you'd like to
insert the page, and enter that sequence number in the form before
clicking the 'Add page' button. The other pages will be re-sequenced
automatically. For example, if you want to insert a page before an
existing one with sequence 12, then enter 12 as the sequence for
adding the new page. The existing page at sequence 12 will be shifted
up to be sequence 13, and so on. To add it on the end, enter the next
sequence number after the last page in the journal. Once you have
created some pages, you can move them up and down in the sequence by
using the
and
icons. If a page has
subsections, then you can move those too by first collapsing the
heading (see below).
Level
This determines the Table of Contents indent level for each
page. You can move the indent level of pages in and out by using the
and
icons next to the
displayed level of each page. If the page has collapsed subsections
(see below), then all subsections are moved in or out in sync. A good
rule of thumb is to make chapter headings indent level 1, and travel
days indent level 2.
Expanding and
Collapsing sections
These options allow you to hide (collapse) or show (expand)
sections of the journal as you're working on it. Sections are defined
by the indent levels of the pages. For example, if a page is at indent
level 1, and there are a number of pages immediately following it
which have indent level 2, then these pages make up a subsection of
the first page. This should be pretty intuitive - it works the same
way as a standard hierarchical Table of Contents. When a section is
expanded, it shows a
icon. This
means you can collapse it, which means to hide its subsections. A
collapsed heading has a
icon, to
indicate that it can be expanded. Clicking on these icons toggles the
headings between the two states. You can also click on the same icons
at the top of the table, to expand/collapse the entire journal at
once.
This feature serves two purposes:
Visual aid: It can help for longer journals to only show
the particular chapter you're working on, and hide the rest (This only
applies when you're looking at the Edit Contents page; when viewing
the journal normally, these options have no affect).
Moving entire sections: You can change the sequence and
indent of entire sections at once, by simply operating on the section
heading. To move an entire section, collapse it first. To move a page
individually, without affecting its subsections, expand it first. In
other words, hidden (collapsed) sub sections are always moved along
with the heading under which they are hidden.
For example, let's say you have a chapter heading with a number of
subsections. Sections and subsections are identified by the indent
level. If a page is indented below the previous page, then it's a
subsection. So the heading page could be at indent level 1, and the
subsequent subsections at level 2.
Now, what happens when you move the section heading? Do the
subsections move as well? There may be times when you want to just
move the heading, and other times you want to move the entire
section. That's where this feature comes in handy. If you want to move
the entire section up or down (using the
and
icons), then you can
collapse the main section heading and just move it - all subsections
will be moved as well. If the heading is expanded , then only that one
page is moved, and the subsections stay put. So, this feature gives
you some flexibility as to how you can move individual pages and whole
sections around.
In summary: To move an entire section, collapse it first. To just
move the one page, make sure it's expanded first. This also applies to
shifting sections and page indents in and out.
One final note regarding the display of this page in Web
browsers. When you click on one of the small icons (, , , ,
and
), you are in effect asking the webserver for a new page. In
the process, the action which you're requesting will be done, and the
new page will reflect those changes. However, the web server can't
tell where you had scrolled to on the previous page, and so it can't
always return you to the exact same spot on the new page. As a result,
you should be careful to re-orient yourself when the new page
appears. For example, let's say you clicked on a
icon to move a page
indent. Now, when you clicked on the icon it may have been near the
bottom of the browser screen. But when the new page comes up the same
page may now appear in the middle of the screen. The server tries its
best to give you a good screen position (and to keep it consistent
between actions), but this is just something to be aware of.
Editing Pages
This option is available either from
the
Edit Contents page, or from
simply going to the page in question from the normal Table of Contents
and looking for the 'Edit' option up in the navbar near the top of the
page.
The page edit form has a number of different buttons, which do
different things after submitting the form. All of the buttons save
whatever changes you made before going on to do their additional
operation. The buttons are:
Finish - submit the form (i.e. save whatever
changes you made) and then return to wherever you were before
you were editing (generally either the 'edit contents' page,
or else the page you were just editing in view mode).
Save & keep editing - submit the form, and then
come back to this same edit form, for the same page. This is
intended to be useful for periodically saving long edits when
you (say) have a flaky internet connection or simply want to
make sure you don't do a lot of typing only to lose it all at
once due to some browser issue.
Edit next page - submit the form, and then go the
same form for the next page in the journal or article. Useful
for when you are doing little tweaks to the whole journal, and
working your way through the pages.
Insert new page after this - submit the form, and
then go to the 'add new page' form, with the sequence being
the next page in the journal. In other words, just as the
button says - inserting a new page after this one. Useful
simply as a shortcut to save yourself having to go back to the
table of contents and then clicking 'Edit' to get to the place
where you can add a new page.
Edit locales - submit the form, and then go to the
'edit locales' form for this page. You can set locales (towns,
countries, world regions etc) for each page in the journal,
just as you can for the journal as a whole. So for example if
this journal page talks about passing through certain towns,
then you can add those as locales here. Or, if a page talks
about a certain country, then you can make that the locale for
the page. This then allows people to find journal and article
pages via browsing or searching by locale. See the section
on Locales for more details.
Down below the main body of the form there are more buttons, which
also save the form before doing their thing. They are mainly for
adding pics and maps to the page:
Upload Pic or File - submit the form, and then go
to the pic/file upload form. You can add pics or files to the
page, as described below in
the Uploading Pictures
section.
Upload Multiple Pics or Files - this uses a special
widget to allow you to select multiple files for upload as a
batch. It currently requires Flash to be working in your
browser, though, which generally precludes most tablets and
smartphones (since they don't work with Flash). In the future
I intend to change this to use the emerging HTML5 multiple
file upload method, which should work on all browsers, but for
now it is Flash-based, sorry about that.
Edit captions - if you have a number of pics
already uploaded to the page, then this allows you to edit all
the captions at once. Just a convenience if you want to do a
mass caption edit all at once without having to edit each pic
individually.
Add map - this website integrates Google maps so
that you can embed them directly into your journal, article,
forum post etc. Additionally, you can define route lines,
place markers, even draw arbitrary shapes on the map. You can
even view elevation profiles. Maps are inserted into the text
much like the pics, and you use this button to add maps. See
the Maps section for more details.
Finally there are a couple of options which do NOT submit the
form, because they are not buttons: View allows you to exit the
form and simply view the page in regular reading mode. Delete
lets you delete the current page (there is a confirmation step). Both
of these options should automatically detect if you have made any
changes to the current form which would be lost by leaving it without
submitting (remember, only the buttons submit the form and save it),
and if so then you should see a popup dialog informing you that there
are unsaved changes and asking to confirm that you are ok with losing
your changes. This is mainly to protect against simply clicking by
mistake and then losing all your work. The Help option will
open this help document in a new browser tab or window, so it won't
risk losing anything from the current form editing session.
Ok, now let's look at the individual fields in the form itself:
Heading
This influences how prominently a page heading is displayed in the
Table of Contents. 'Normal' is just normal sized text. 'Medium' is a
mid-sized heading, and 'Large' is the largest, most prominent
heading. You should use this in conjunction with the 'Level'
setting. In general, main chapter headings should be 'medium', and
travel days (or normal pages) in your journal should be 'small'.
Bold and Italic
These options make your headings bold or italic in
the Table of Contents. Note that for the 'Medium' and 'Large' heading
styles, the browser will probably display those using a bold font
anyway.
Indent level
This is the indent level which the page will be displayed in the
Table of Contents. Level 1 is no indent, you'd use this for main
chapter headings. You usually won't use more than a couple of levels
in any journal. You should use the level of a heading in conjunction
with the heading size. For example, you'd probably use 'medium' or
'large' headings for main chapter headings, and put them at indent
level 1. Travel days (or otherwise 'normal' pages in your journal)
should be 'small', at indent level 2. You can play around with it to
see what looks most pleasing to the eye. Take a look at some of the
other journals on the site to see what other people have done.
Visible
For published journals, it can be useful to be able to create
pages, but have them not be visible to the public until you are
ready. So this checkbox allows you to do this. Usually it is checked,
which means that for published journals, the public will be able to
see the page. For unpublished journals, it won't make any difference -
the journal as a whole is not visible in any case. Unless you
specifically want a page to be invisible, you should leave this box
checked. If unchecked, then the page will only show up in the main
Edit page for the journal or article - i.e. when you click on Edit
when looking at the table of contents. Here, invisible pages will be
flagged with a red '+' or '-' instead of the usual yellow icon.
Google Policy
Sets the Google Policy for this page, if you want to override the
policy for the journal/article as a whole. If you leave it at
'default' then the policy for the journal is used. See the
main Google Policy section for more
details.
Date and Distance
You can set an optional date for the page. If you don't want a
date, then just leave this field as 0000-00-00. Otherwise, the Date
field must be in the format yyyy-mm-dd, and if you make a mistake the
validation routine will probably alert you to this. The Distance
should be in whatever units you chose when creating the journal,
namely miles or kilometers. Both date and distance are completely
optional. They are mostly useful for tour diaries.
One thing is worth noting here regarding Distance. The server uses
this field to calculate the total distance for your trip. In other
words, it totals up all the page distances. So, what happens when you
have a situation where someone wants to put two separate accounts of
the same trip into one journal? This can be seen in John & Lori
Martin's journal,
at www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/martin.
If both John and Lori had both set the distance on all the pages in
their respective accounts, then the "total distance" would have come
out to double what it should be, which is obviously no good. So, to
get around this, Lori made the distance for all her dated pages
zero. This meant that the total distance was now correct (since John's
portion of the journal had all the distances), but now Lori's part
looked weird. We fixed this by adding a special feature: If the
distance for any dated day is zero, then the server will automatically
look for any other dated day in the same journal which has the same
date and a non-zero distance. If one is found, then that distance is
used when displaying the page. In other words, you can have more than
one page in your journal with the same date, and as long as only one
of these pages has the distance set then the total distance for the
journal will not be adversely affected. The page which has zero
distance will automatically display the distance from the page which
has the distance set. This won't affect most people, but it's good to
know about.
There is a note in the FAQ regarding a
common error that people make regarding page dates which results in
the "distance so far" figure appearing to be wrong for some days.
Title and Headline
Next you have the Title and Headline for this page. Why two
separate, similar-sounding fields? Because I wanted to be able to have
a Table of Contents which looked nice. I wanted to have names for my
pages like "Day 1: The Long Goodbye", but I only wanted the link to be
on the "Day 1" part, not the whole thing. So, I separated the two
out. In the Table Of Contents (and when displaying the page), these
fields are shown as "Title: Headline". The Headline is optional, and
if you omit it then just "Title" is displayed. This gives some
flexibility - for example, you can have "Introduction", and also
"Appendix A: Equipment List". For travel days I like to make the Title
field the day number of the trip. For example, "Day 23".
You should try to choose headlines that are somewhat interesting
or witty - someone who is scanning your journal Table of Contents
should feel drawn into the story, and wacky headlines can pique
someone's interest sufficiently for them spend some time finding out
what happened on a day entitled "Day 46 : Ash Grove to Pittsburg - The
Diarrhea Song". And that reminds me - you might also give some idea in
the headline as to the start and end point of the day, if it's a
travel day. This gives some idea of progress.
Text
The next field is the meat of the page - the body, or text. Here
is where you enter what happened that day, or else the prose such as
Introduction, Afterword etc. You can also specify pics in the text,
as seen in the next sections.
Edit comment
This is some optional text that will be shown on the table of
contents next to the page heading. For the first day, the text is
shown in red, then green after that. The text is displayed for up to
one week. It allows you to give some indication to readers of what
changes and edits you've been making on your journal, e.g. "Added some
pics" or "Just small changes". This allows readers to see whether it
is worth re-reading a page that they already read previously; if you
were just fixing typos, then it's probably not worth revisiting, but
if you added some major new content or pics, then it is probably worth
a look. So this is really just a visual cue for authors to tell
readers what's new. It's totally optional, and the text disappears
automatically after a week, so you don't have to worry about going
back and removing it.
Auto-Format Option
This is an option that allows you to control how newlines in your
text are treated. This is necessary because Web browsers actually
ignore simple newlines in text, and so we have to convert newlines
into the appropriate HTML tags for newline (<BR>) and paragraph
(<P>). A "paragraph" break is like a newline, but with a bigger
gap, like this:
You enter newlines into your text by using the "Enter" key. You'll
notice that you don't need to use Enter when you reach the right edge
of the editing window while typing - the text wraps around to the next
line automatically. When this happens, that is known as a "soft"
newline, in other words it is not stored with the text. It's just
there to make the text fit into the editing window. So you need to use
Enter to get a real, or "hard" new line. This may all be obvious, but
it's worth pointing out for people who haven't necessarily used a Web
browser much to enter text.
The thing is, you sometimes want your newlines to be "hard"
newlines in your text, and other times you'd prefer to ignore them -
for example, when you import text from another source that has "hard"
wrapped the text. This looks really awful on most browsers (since
everyone has different screen sizes, browsers want to be able to wrap
lines to the user's window size, but if the lines are "hard" wrapped
then this doesn't work). So, in summary, this option allows you to say
how you would like to treat newlines in your text. It may seem complex
at first, but you'll see that it allows for all the different
possibilities and variations in text that you might want to enter or
import. It's worth having a quick read of the options below so that
you can choose the right option for your pages - you could save
yourself a lot of time later on.
There are three possibilities for the "Auto-Format" option:
1. Auto-Format - single newlines are dropped, double newlines become paragraph separators
This is good for most cases. All sequences of two or more
consecutive newlines are converted into HTML paragraph separators, and
all single newlines are stripped out. This is particularly useful when
importing badly formatted text from other sources (e.g. pasting text
that has been "hard wrapped"). Be warned that when you do this, you
will lose all single hard newlines in your text! Double newlines will
be converted into paragraph separators (<P> tags), and so will
be saved. This is usually a good thing; an exception is when you have
lists whose items are separated by single newlines. In this case, the
list will be collapsed into a single paragraph, so you might want to
use the next option, to preserve single newlines. If it's a large
amount of text you want to reformat, then it may be easiest to just
save first with the full auto-format option, to perform most of the
formatting for you. Then go back and re-add the newlines for the list,
set auto-format to option (2), and save the page.
2. List Format - single newlines are preserved, double newlines become paragraph separators
This will convert all sequences of two or more newlines into
paragraph separators (the <P> tag), and convert single newlines
into the HTML <BR> tag. This is useful for lists, since you
generally write lists of items separated by single newlines. Thus
these will be converted into real HTML newline tags, which will look
the way you'd expect your list to look. You can safely use this option
for most pages, the main exception being cases where you are pasting
in text from another source. In this case, sometimes the pasted text
has a lot of "hard" newlines which really shouldn't be there, and you
probably want to use the full auto-format option (1).
3. Raw - no auto formatting at all, for advanced users who know HTML
The text is left exactly as you entered it. Beware! This means
that simple newlines will not be displayed as actual newlines
in the finished webpage. This is because browsers treats all
whitespace characters (including tabs, spaces and newlines) as a
single space when displaying web pages. This is part of the HTML
standard. Remember, if you want a newline in your page and you are
turning auto-format off, then it's up to you to put the necessary
<BR> and <P> HTML tags. You should use this option if you
are going to use <PRE> or <TABLE> tags, since <BR>
tags inside tables can really mess up the formatting.
So, to summarize: If you're going to do non-trivial HTML in your
page, then it's probably best to have no auto-formatting. If all
you're doing is some emphasis and/or headings, then you can probably
leave it on option (1), for auto-format. Just try it and see how it
looks!
The auto-format option is set to be full auto-format (1) by
default, since most pages benefit from being formatted
automatically. You should change it for pages which contain
<TABLE> sections (see next
section, on HTML formatting), or manually formatted lists - since
you probably want to retain the newlines in these pages just as you
entered them.
The state of the auto-format option is saved with each page - so
the next time you go and edit the page, this option will come up the
same as what you selected the last time you saved the page.
Locales Format Option
This allows you to select how you want page locales to be
displayed on the page. You can leave this at the default if you don't
define any locales. See the section on Page
Locales for more details of how this works.
Update timestamp
See Update timestamp.
Formatting text with HTML
Web browsers display text which has been written in a special
format, called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). This consists of
special "tags" which you put into your text. Tags are written inside
"pointy brackets" - like this: <BR>. There are lots of different
tags, for specifying things like italic text, bold text
and so on. Some tags stand by themselves, such as the newline tag,
<BR>. Others come in pairs, and they bracket the beginning and
end of a text region. For example, to make a piece of text italic, you
put <I> and </I> around the relevant words. The forward
slash is commonly used in HTML to signify the "end" of a tag
pair. HTML is really quite simple, though very powerful. The whole Web
is built on it!
One common thing that people ask about it how to mark up some text
with a hyperlink. You do this using the A (anchor) tag. So to put a
link to some website around some text, you do this: <A
HREF="http://www.example.com/">blah blah</A> - this comes
out looking like this: blah
blah.
For most purposes you don't need to be aware of HTML explicitly,
because basic formatting, such as new lines, is done automatically for
you. So if you put a newline in your text, it will be converted into a
<BR> tag. Also, links and URL's which are in the form
http://www.example.com
or www.example.com are
automatically marked up as HTML hyperlinks for you (as seen here). So
you don't need to do any special HTML tags for URL's - just write the
address. If the web address starts with "www" then you don't need the
"http://" for it to be recognized, but if it does not start with "www"
then you'll probably need to put the "http://" for it to be marked up
correctly.
Another useful HTML tag to know about is <PRE>. If you have
text which you want to "pre"-format as, say, a table, then you can put
it between <PRE> and </PRE> tags. What this does is to
make the browser display all the text between these tags in a
non-proportional font. In other words, it is displayed literally as
you typed it, complete with spaces. This lets you format using spaces,
lining up columns and so on. For example:
<PRE>
Day
Miles
Weather
1
15
Good
2
34
Rain
3
43
Clouds
</PRE>
The <PRE> tag is useful sometimes because of the way that
spaces, tabs and newlines (i.e. "whitespace" characters) are
displayed. The HTML specification says that browsers should normally
treat any number of whitespace characters as a single space. Thus it
doesn't matter how many spaces or tabs you put between words - on the
browser it will appear as a single space. This is because HTML
separates the structure and the presentation of a document; you can
read more about this if you're interested (see the book reference,
below). The <PRE> tag gets around this rule, by forcing the
browser to display all the text between the tags "as-is". So why not
display all text like this? Well, usually text just looks better when
you give the browser discretion as to what's the best way to display
it. Usually you don't care too much about exactly lining up columns,
and proportional fonts are nicer to look at. So, the <PRE> tag
is there when you need it, which probably isn't actually that often.
Note that if you use the <PRE> tag then you should remember
to uncheck the Auto-format
option. This is so that all the newlines and spaces which you so
carefully formatted aren't automatically stripped out and reformatted!
If you want more ambitious tabular data, then you need the
<TABLE> tag. This is too complicated to get into here; If you're
interested in learning more about this or other HTML tags, then I can
recommend the book "HTML
& XHTML: The Definitive Guide", by Chuck Musciano & Bill Kennedy
(O'Reilly, ISBN
059600026X) It's very concise and to-the-point, and you'll find
yourself turning to it again and again as you write your documents. Of
course, you can always also contact me if you are having problems or
just have a question - I'll be glad to help out in any way I can.

When trying out these tutorials, remember to take into account the
following section - not all tags will work.
Posting explicit HTML using hat (^) codes
Sometimes it can be useful to post explicit html code in text
(e.g. <i>italic</i>), usually when explaining how to achieve
some desired effect. This seems difficult at first, since if you just
put the html code in your text then it gets interpreted by the browser
(thus displaying the effect rather than the tags themselves), and if
you use character entities (e.g. &lt; for the opening pointy brace
on an html tag) then these tend to get converted by the browser into
the corresponding "real" characters automatically in the text edit
box, so you lose them the first time you edit your text.
To get around this, I have made a proprietary set of codes which
use the hat symbol (^), which you can use in your text when you need
to express html tags and entities explicitly. I then have code to
automatically convert these special codes into the corresponding html
entities at display time. The benefit is that since these are
proprietary, there is no automatic conversion done by the browser, so
they get left alone, which means you can edit them without losing
them. However when you view your text, the hat codes get converted by
my code into the correct html entities. Below is a list of the
available codes:
^T - tab, which simply gets expanded to eight non-breaking spaces
(i.e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
^LT - "less than" character entity (&lt;) useful for posting
explicit html tag references without them getting interpreted as html
by the browser, e.g. <b>bold text<b> is written ^LTb>bold
text^LT/b>
^AMP - ampersand (&), useful for posting explicit html character
entities e.g. &nbsp; is achieved explicitly in text by putting
^AMPnbsp;
^HASH - hash (#), maybe useful for character entities that have a
hash, e.g. to have &#60; appear explicitly in the text, you
can write ^AMP^HASH60; or actually just ^AMP#60; will work too (the
^HASH code may be redundant, since you can achieve most of what you
need with just ^AMP, but it's there anyway in case it's useful).
^HAT - the hat symbol (^), used to write these hat codes
explicitly in the text e.g. to have ^LT appear explicitly (rather than
getting converted to a less-than sign), you'd write ^HATLT.
^NBSP - as noted above, this gets converted into &nbsp;
These codes are not case-sensitive, so ^LT is the same as ^lt.
Allowed HTML Tags
Due to the security risks of cross-site scripting attacks, it is
unfortunately necessary to restrict the HTML that can be used on the
site to a subset of the full HTML tagset. Here are some articles that
go into more detail if you're interested:
Cross Site Scripting (Wikipedia)
The Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) FAQ
HTML Code Injection and Cross-site scripting: Understanding the cause and effect of CSS (XSS) Vulnerabilities
Real World XSS
A general rule on the website is that one-line entry fields do not
allow any HTML at all, and multiline entry fields allow for the HTML
tags specified below.
Here is a list of all the HTML tags and their associated
attributes that are allowed on this site. Note that all other tags
(and tag attributes) will be refused. There is not enough space here
to explain each tag and its attributes in full; see an HTML reference
for more details.
Note: If you are trying to use some tag or attribute that
you think should be on the list, then let me
know. I've tried to include all the common tags and attributes,
but inevitably I probably missed a few. I am very willing to add tags
and attributes to the "allowed" list, just about anything except for
the script-embedding stuff and (unfortunately) <IMG>, which just
seems have too much potential for exploitation.

Using Empty Pages to create Chapter headings
If you leave the main text field for a page completely empty, then
the page is only displayed as a placeholder in the Table of Contents,
without any link. Additionally, when traversing the journal using the
"Next" and "Prev" tabs on the navigation bar, pages with no text are
skipped over automatically. This allows you to have chapter headings
which are basically just there as placeholders to visually split up
the Table of Contents in a sensible way. For example, I have empty
Chapter pages for each State I passed through. New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, etc. This also gives some structure to long rides. You
could also do this by country, county, town, or whatever else you feel
like. Of course, there is nothing stopping you from putting text in
any page, in which case it will be displayed with a link as normal in
the table of contents.
Uploading Pictures
You are able to include pictures in your narrative. Look for the
'Upload Pic or File' button on the Edit
Page screen, after the main form. In brief what you do is choose a
picture (usually a JPEG or GIF), or a non-image file (e.g. PDF or Word
doc) from your local hard drive (or another website) and send it to
the web server for storage. There is also an option for uploading
multiple pics at once, which I'll describe below after going over the
single pic upload form.
When you click on 'Upload Pic or File', you'll see a form that
gives you a choice of either selecting a file from your local
computer, or else fetching the file from somewhere on the Web using a
URL. The simpler option here by far is to use the first option,
labeled 'Local path'. There should be a 'Browse' or similar button
next to the field, which if you click it will bring up a standard
dialog for choosing a file. This works slightly differently depending
on what type of computer you are using, but basically what you do is
navigate through your computer's file system to find the file you
want, then select it and click 'Ok' to finish the dialog. There are
some browsers on Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad which have
disabled file selection, so you may find that the 'Browse' button is
grayed out or otherwise disabled. If you see this then the workaround
is to simply use a different browser - one that seems to work most of
the time is iCab Mobile, which is available on iTunes for a couple of
dollars.
The other way to get a file is to enter the URL of the image. This
is much more complex than uploading a file from your local computer,
since you need to know the URL of the file itself, rather than the
address of the web page where the file is displayed. This distinction
is hard to explain in non-technical terms, because it requires some
basic awareness of how HTML (the language of the Web) works. Web pages
are text files formatted using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). This
markup language is used to specify things like links, headings and
other types of formatting. It is also used to include images in the
text. This is done using a type of link, called an IMG link (for
"image"). Images, or pics, are not actually stored in the HTML itself;
they are kept as separate files, and simply linked to from within the
HTML. So the Web page URL which you see in your browser address bar
isn't actually the address of the pic itself; it's just the address of
the HTML page where the image is linked from. It's not always easy to
get the actual URL of the image itself. The website where the image
lives might give you this option, but it will be different on each
photo storage website and far outside of the scope of this Help
document to cover in any meaningful way - besides, websites are
constantly changing their format. Basically all I can tell you is that
you need to get the URL of the image file. Sometimes your Web browser
will let you get this URL, often by right clicking on the image so
that a popup menu appears. You might see an option in that menu that
says something like 'Copy URL to clipboard'. Or, you might have to
select a 'Properties' option, at which point a dialog will appear that
shows the URL as one of the properties of the image. But again,
browsers are constantly changing and I can't give instructions on how
to do that here. If you're not familiar enough with your browser to
know how to get an image URL, then you will need to do some research
online to figure out how to do it. There are generally lots of
how-to's online these days, easily accessible if you use the right
keywords in your search (e.g. "internet explorer get image url").
Just to be clear, you would use EITHER the first option in the
form to select a file locally on your computer, OR you would enter a
URL to get it from some remote website. Use one or the other, not
both.
One more note about this: If you are unable to select files
because of limitations of the device you're using, then you should
look at the option for emailing
updates to your journal. Most devices are internet-aware these
days, and if they are then they should be able to send email, so this
might be a workaround.
Ok, so let's assume you have managed to select your file by one of
the above methods. Next you'll see a field called 'Save as
filename'. You don't have to fill this out, as the server will try to
use your original filename when you do the upload. But this just gives
you the option to save it under some different filename for your
journal. It's entirely optional. It's worth noting that if you upload
all of your pics with the same name (e.g. "pic.jpg") then the system
will prepend some random characters when saving the file, so that it
doesn't conflict with the previous files that were uploaded with the
same name. This is why you might end up with files that seem to have
some garbage at the front of the name (e.g. Gh7f3V_pic.jpg) - it's
just randomly generated in order to make the filename unique.
Next up is the Caption field, which is again optional, but you
should think about adding captions to your pics, as this will help to
give some context and perhaps explain what people are looking at. For
example if this is a photo of some people, you might want to say who
is there in the scene. Or if it's a scenic shot, then where it
is. Whatever you like, basically, and you can feel free to be
creative, making up humorous captions etc.
Next is the 'Rotate' field, which allows you to rotate your image
file. This is obviously only relevant to image files like photos. Most
of the time you can just leave this set to 'Auto', because modern
cameras generally include some meta information in the image file
(called EXIF data) which includes information about how the camera was
oriented when the photo was taken. In other words, the server can
determine whether the photo needs to be rotated, and if it does then
it can do that automatically. However there some cases where this
can't happen automatically, and so in that case you can edit your pic
and specify the rotation manually. The rotation can be done in
increments of 90 degrees, going clockwise.
The 'Border' field on the pic/file upload form allows you to
specify whether or not you want the standard gray border to be
displayed around the pic. This is purely a style preference. Most of
the time it's ok to leave this checkbox checked, but there may be
times when you want to uncheck it. You can just experiment to see what
you prefer. You can always change it later without having to re-upload
the pic again.
The 'Include in random' checkbox allows you to say whether you
want the pic to show up in the Serendipity page, which is a page on
the site that allows people to view random selection of pics. This
option also affects whether the pic will be shown on the title page of
your journal, should you use the 'random' option to show random pics
there. You might want to uncheck this box for diagrams, screenshots,
charts or other relatively boring images, while leaving it enabled for
scenic shots and other "pretty" pics. It's up to you, though.
If your journal has been published, then there is one more
checkbox for Updating the journal timestamp -
see Update timestamp for details.
The last step is to click the 'Finish' button, whereupon your pic
or file will be uploaded and stored on the server.
Scaling of Pics: Large, Small and Thumbnail
When you upload a picture, three versions of the file are stored:
Large, medium and thumbnail. The large version is the original (but it
may be scaled down too, see next paragraph). The medium size is
typically scaled by 50%, and this is stored as the "small"
version. Finally, a "thumbnail" version which is usually 10% of the
original size is saved. These three versions are used by the server
when users choose their options for viewing pictures, in the Options page. If your images are
unusually small then they will not be scaled down as much, so that the
thumbnails won't be too tiny to see.
If your picture is very large then it will automatically be scaled
down (this applies to the 'large' size of the pic). This rule is only
applied if the image is more that 1000 pixels
in both dimensions (height and width). So, if you'd like to
maximize the size of your pics, then size them so that the smaller
dimension is 1000 pixels or less. For
example, a picture which is 1200 x 1100 will be automatically scaled down so
that the smaller dimension is 1000, because
both dimensions are more than 1000; but a pic
that is 1400 x 1000 will be left as-is.
Please note: If you are uploading pics from your digital
camera, then it's very likely that your originals will be much bigger
than the size that is stored on crazyguyonabike. In other words, it's
likely that your pics will be scaled down, as described in the
preceding paragraph. For this reason, you should not treat this
website as an archive for your digital photos, since the version
stored here will likely not be as high resolution as your
original. Unfortunately it would take a lot more storage space if I
was to store the originals as well - digital cameras these days can
produce very large files, and we would need a lot more disk space to
handle all that. In the future, I would like to be able to also store
the originals, but for now you should be careful to keep your
originals archived in a safe place. So if you're on the road, make
sure you send copies home regularly for safekeeping. Nothing sucks
more than losing a bunch of irreplacable images!
If you use a scanner, then in general you should be scanning your
files at a resolution of 75 dpi (this is the maximum that web browsers
can display at anyway). Personally, I scanned my pics at 600 dpi,
directly from the slides. This gave good quality, large pics which
could then be scaled down. Scanning directly from the negatives or
slides gives much superior quality to scanning from prints, but you
need a transparency/slide adaptor for your scanner. This can cost more
than the scanner itself, but it is well worth it in my opinion, if you
want the best quality scans.
Most people these days will be using a digital camera; in this
case, you can sometimes select "web quality" for the pics. However, be
careful of this; you really want to have your "originals" be as high
quality as possible, so that you can make good prints of them later
on. Remember that you can always take a high resolution image and make
it lower resolution, but you can never go the other way. It's better
to keep high-resolution originals, and make low-res (75 dpi) ones for
uploading to the website. This takes more time, and requires a
graphics manipulation program such as PhotoShop or The Gimp, but it's worth the trouble
if you care about keeping your photos for posterity.
Every journal you create gets its own picture folder, so there
is no danger of similar filenames in different journals
clashing. Filenames can only contain letters, numbers, dashes, and
underline characters. No slashes or other punctuation is allowed.
Pics are automatically converted into JPEG format, if they are
not already (unless they are GIF, in which case they stay GIF). This
helps the server and ensures that images are compatible with all
browsers. This was done because some people uploaded images in Windows
BMP format, which is not viewable on some non-Windows platforms. Since
JPEG format is best all-round for photos anyway, I decided to do the
conversion automatically. The filename extension is also changed to
reflect this; the standard extension is '.jpg'.
Batch Upload of Pics and Files
If you are editing a journal or article then there is an option to
upload multiple pics at once. This can be useful because when you have
a lot of pics to upload, then it can be very tedious to have to do
each one individually (especially true if you have a slow connection).
Batch upload has to be a special option, because generally Web
browsers only allow you to select one file at a time for upload. Since
there is no easy way to do this using the browser's built-in features,
we have to use a third party "widget", which entails utilizing the
file dialog included in Adobe's Flash player (a browser plugin that
enables things like video). So, if you want to use the batch upload
feature, then you will need to have Flash installed. You
can click
here to go to Adobe's website and download Flash. It should be
noted that some platforms, most obviously some of the "tablet" style
devices, do not support Flash at all. You will need to determine
whether Flash is available for your device; if it is not, then
unfortunately you will not be able to utilize the batch upload feature
here (at least, not until HTML5 becomes more common, at which point we
may be able to dispense with the Flash widget and go back to using the
built-in features of the web browser again).
Ok, so assuming that you have Flash installed and working, when
you click on 'Upload Multiple Pics or Files', you should see a form
that has some options common to the previous discussion of single file
upload. There are checkboxes for 'Border' and 'Include in random', see
above for an explanation of how these work. Then below that you'll see
an empty box labeled 'Upload queue', and below that a button labeled
'Upload'. That button is a good test of whether your Flash
installation is working: If you see 'Upload' then it's probably ok,
but if you don't see the button at all then there is something wrong
with your Flash install that will need to be fixed before you can use
batch upload. Assuming you do see the button, if you click on it then
you should see a fairly standard file selection dialog appear. The way
you select multiple files will differ according to your platform, but
often you do it using the Ctrl or Command key held down while clicking
on the files. See your individual platform Help for how to select
multiple files. When you click 'Ok', then the upload will begin. You
should see the files you selected listed in the 'Upload queue' box,
along with progress bars as they get transferred. A few seconds after
each file is finished, it will be removed from the queue. Then, after
all the files have completed, you are taken to a page where you can
enter captions for all the files that were just uploaded. This is
optional. Then you can finish, and that's it.
Inserting Pictures Into Your Text
After you upload a picture, you are returned to the
Edit Page screen. Now you should be able to
scroll down past the form and see your picture listed, along with its
caption. Also, you will see above the picture a code, something like
## file.jpg ##. This is the name of the file which you specified when
you uploaded the picture. To put the picture in your text, you just
insert this code in the text of the page, where you want the pic to
appear. It was done this way to allow some freedom as to how pages are
constructed; so you can have text, followed by a picture, followed by
more text, etc, just how you want it. The pic will automatically be
formatted and displayed with the caption in the same style as other
journals. Thus you don't need to know anything about HTML to include
pics in your text.
As a convenience, this code is now inserted automatically for you
at the end of your page text. So you can move it around or insert text
as you please.
If you make a mistake and put a filename which doesn't exist, then
you will see ## NO SUCH FILE ## in your text. Just go back and edit
the page, and put the correct filename.
There is also a way to upload the picture or file directly to a
spot in your text that you designate ahead of time. You do this by
putting #*# in the place(s) in the text where you want pics to be
inserted. Each time you do an upload, it will check for #*# in the
text first, and if it is found then the first instance will be used as
a location to insert this pic. The #*# will be automatically replaced
with the usual ## filename ## notation. So this is basically just a
way of giving the system hints as to where you want pics to go, rather
than being appended at the end of the text.
If you upload more than 25 pics, then
the page will be split into parts (this is only a visual aid for the
reader - your page is still one page, just being shown in multiple
parts to split up the pics).
Managing Pictures - Moving, Deleting and Hiding
To delete a pic, you can use the 'Delete' link associated with the
pic in the Page Edit form (the pics for the page are listed after the
text fields). You can also simply remove the ## filename ## code for
the pic from the text and then save the page. For safety, you will see
a confirmation list of all the pics you're deleting in this way, with
checkboxes. To confirm the deletion, you simply click 'Save' again. To
keep any of the pics, you can un-check the relevant checkboxes. Those
pics will then still be associated with the page, but won't be shown
anywhere in the journal. So this is a good way to keep pics hidden,
perhaps for future use.
To move a pic from one page to another in your journal, you can
edit the pic, and select the page which you want to move it to by
selecting from the dropdown list of pages in the edit form. The pic
will be removed from the current page, and added onto the end of the
new page.
You can also move a pic to another page by copying and pasting the
## filename ## code from the text of the original page to the new
page. When you save the new page, the pic will be moved. Be careful
when you save the original page - if you remove the ## filename ##
code and save, then you'll be asked if you want to delete the pic
(since it looks like that's what you're doing). You should un-check
the box to keep the pic during the move. Note that you don't really
have to manually remove the code from the source page - this will
happen automatically when you save the new page with the ## filename
## code.
Copyright Issues with Pics
Personal rant: For what it's worth, I am totally
disgusted with the direction our world is headed with "intellectual
property rights". It seems that everything under the sun is patentable
(even our own genes!) and the U.S. government keeps extending the
Copyright expiration period to placate the big corporations such as
Disney. Increasingly, we are seeing the erosion of "fair use"
privileges which apparently makes it illegal to even do things like
copy CDs you purchased totally legally. Who really cares if you copy
and paste a map image from a free, public website into your journal? I
mean, they made these maps available FOR FREE for crying out
loud. Still, sadly, in these days of fascist intellectual property
policies, we need to be cognizant of the risks and protect ourselves
accordingly. So, take the following with that in mind - I hate it, I
don't believe in it, but it's up to you to make sure you're "right
with the law" as I don't have the time or the energy to go checking up
on each and every journal page...
You must either be the lawful owner of the images that you upload,
or else have permission from the copyright owner for using their image
on this website. This usually applies most to maps, both online and
scanned. See this
thread on the Journals forum for more on the subject.
Here is a list of resources which have stated that it's ok to use
their maps. If you know of other resources then please let me know and I'll add them to the
list. Thanks!

Editing Page Locales
When you're on a tour it would be nice sometimes to be able to give
people a better idea of exactly where you are on a particular
day. Some people have used links in their text to services like Mapquest to achieve this. Now you
can also do this using the journal editing tools. Go to the page in
question, then click 'Edit', then 'Locales' (in the navigation bar,
it's below the 'Edit' option once you're in the page edit form). Then
you will have a form where you can view the locales that have already
been added (if any) and add new ones. If you click "Add another
locale" then you will see a form where you can enter the name of the
town, along with (optionally) the state and country. The state and
country are not really necessary, as the system will simply list all
the matches found in the database for that town name. The database
covers the entire world, so most towns should be in there already, but
please do let me know if one is missing. Once you have searched for
your town you can simply click on the appropriate one to add it to
your list.
There are two ways of finding places; you can either search by name,
or browse down through country, state/province, county and so on. If
you browse, then you will also be able to see an index of towns once
you are below the country level. This can help if you are not sure of
the spelling of the town name, or if you don't know exactly which
state or county where the place is located.
Tip: You can use the '*' character (asterisk) as a wildcard
when entering names. So for example you could put 'Buckhorn*' if you
want to see everything that starts with 'Buckhorn'. Don't put the * at
the front of the name, otherwise the database won't be able to use the
index and it'll be horribly slow (probably time out). The search
automatically puts a wildcard at the end of the place name, so for
example if you put "Yellowstone" then it will find everything
beginning with that word, including "Yellowstone State Park". So,
usually, there won't be much need to use the '*' wildcard, but it does
give a little added flexibility in the search if you're having trouble
finding a place.
Once you have finished adding places to the list, you click "Finished"
to save the list and return to the page. You will see the locales
listed at the top of your page. There is also a link to Google maps, which shows the location
of the town. This will be useful for people to get a better idea of
where you are, since they can zoom in and out.
Choosing how the page locales will be displayed
Usually, the locales will be displayed at the top of the
page. However, you can also change this in the main Edit Page form
(where you edit the page text). Below the 'Auto-Format' option there
is another one for how to display page locales. The options are
'Default', 'Top', 'Bottom' or 'Manual'. If you select Default, then
the setting that was specified in the Journal Properties form (when
you created the journal, or go to Table of Contents -> Edit ->
Properties) is used. If you select Top or Bottom, then the locales
will be shown at the top or bottom of the page respectively. If you
choose 'Manual' then no locales will be shown by default; you will
have to put special codes into the text wherever you want the locales
to appear. These codes have the form '@@n', where n is the number of
the locale you wish to display (numbers start at 1). So to display the
first locale, you'd put @@1, the second is @@2 and so on. These
in-line locales will have the full locale name, including the map
link. You can format these however you like - the locale will be shown
exactly where you put it, with no surrounding text or HTML. You can
also use these codes anywhere in the text even if you have selected
Default, Top or Bottom - this means you'll be able to repeat the
locale in the page body if you want, even with the automatic
display. So, you could for example have all the locales shown
automatically at the top of the page, but then refer specifically to
one or more of them again in the text.
Emailing updates to your journal
When you are on the road it can be hard to have full, regular
access to the Web. However, it can be convenient to compose emails
offline, and then send them in batch whenever you get internet
connectivity. To enable this, I've implemented a feature which allows
you to send a specially formatted email to your journal from anywhere
on the road, and it will get immediately posted as a new page (or an
update to an existing page). This section will tell you how to do
this.
Where to send the message
First of all, you need to define a "handle" for your journal, if
you haven't already. This is done on
the Journal Properties form. For
example, say you choose "mytrip" as your handle - you will then use
this as the basis for the address which you will send your updates
to. The email address is "handle@crazyguyonabike.com". So for our
example journal you would use mytrip@crazyguyonabike.com as the
'To' address. Please note that the journal handle address must be the
ONLY recipient, and it must be in the 'To' field - do not CC or BCC
these updates to other people, as this will compromise your journal
password (and also possibly make your update fail, since my code
assumes just the one recipient). The 'From' field does not matter; you
can send these messages from any email account.
A common mistake people make with this is to use their own login
username for the 'To' address, rather than the journal handle. This
won't work, because of the fact that authors can have many different
journals on the site; if you address the email to your username, how
would the system know which journal to deliver it to? So it's
important that you use the journal-specific handle, not your username.
Please note: This email address is only valid for posting
updates to your journal - it cannot be used as a address to send or
receive mail to/from other people. DO NOT GIVE OUT THIS EMAIL ADDRESS
TO OTHER PEOPLE. It only works for posting entries, with the special
formatting which I explain below. If someone sends a standard email to
this address, it will bounce and I will get a plaintive message from
some stranger asking me why they can't contact so-and-so. I want to
emphasize this because I have had cases where authors have given their
"journal email address" to people they meet on the road, and those
people have then thought that they can email the author using that
address.
Sometimes people confuse email and web addresses. Remember that an
email address has the '@' symbol, web addresses do not. So to give
your journal web address, and your journal handle is 'neil98', just
say http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/neil98. You can omit the
'http://' bit if you like, since all modern browsers will assume that
if you type in a URL.
Setting the journal email password
Originally, the email feature required that you put your login
username and password in the body of the email in order to
authenticate yourself. However this presents some potential security
issues, since emails are transmitted in plain text - so that makes
your password vulnerable to snooping in the (unlikely) event that
someone was intercepting internet traffic. So, I made an alternative:
An 'email password' specific to the journal, which you set in
the journal properties form
(i.e. same as the one where you set the journal handle). Just set the
email password for the journal to any old passphrase, then you can use
this as the password when emailing journal entries - no need to put
your login username and password. I have kept this old method of
authenticating, since there are people who have been using it for a
while and I don't want to break their established system of
posting. But the new method is much preferred. There is much less risk
if the email is intercepted, since the email password cannot be used
to log into your account on the website - it's only for these emails.
'Subject' optionally specifies Title: Headline
You can use the 'Subject' of the email message to specify the
title and headline for the new page, just as you do in the Edit Page
form. You separate the title and the headline using a colon (':'), in
the same way that the Title and Headline are separated in the final
display of the page. So for example if you put 'Day 1: Getting
started' as the subject, then the page title would be set to 'Day 1'
and the headline would be 'Getting Started'. As you may remember, the
only reason for having both Title and Headline is that the Title gets
the link in the Table of Contents, whereas the headline is plain
text. If there is no colon present in the Subject, then it is used as
the title, and the headline is left blank. If you don't specify any
subject at all, then the current date is used for the title by default
(unless you specify a date in the message body - see below), for
example the title would be set to 'Saturday, March 15th 2003' (or
whatever today's date is). In this case the headline is left
empty. This is useful as a default, since it says when you posted the
entry.
The message body
The body of your email contains the text you want to post. At the
beginning, you need to put some additional information which specifies
things like password, and, optionally, some additional settings which
correspond to the fields on the Edit page
form which you would use if you were posting your page via a Web
browser. Here's an example, just to give you a feel for what it looks
like - I'll explain what the individual lines mean below:
password = bananatuesday
title = some title
headline = some headline
date = 2003-04-05
distance = 23
size = small
style = bold
indent = 2
format = auto
update_timestamp = 0
Hello there, here's some text
Note that you have at the start some lines which are in the form
"option = value", followed by some plain text which is your post. The
only mandatory option line is the password - all the others will
default to reasonable values if you don't specify them. So you could
have a minimal post that runs something like this:
password = banana546
Hi everyone, this is Joe and I'm finally on the road!
... but that's the minimal case. More usually, I would probably
specify this sort of information:
password = blahdeblahblahblah
date = 2004-04-29
distance = 67
Well, that's it, I'm off, blah blah blah
I would have the subject of the email as something like "Day 1:
From home to the first camping spot", and this would get parsed out
with the title as "Day 1" and the headline as "From home to the first
camping spot". This results in a nice looking contents page.
Options Reference
The options always go at the start of the email, and the format is
'option = value', with the option being at the very start of the line,
and nothing else on the line after the value.
All of these settings
are optional, except for the password, which must always be supplied.
Following is a list of the options, with their possible
abbreviations For example, 'username | u' means the full name of the
option is 'username', but you can also abbreviate this as
'u'. Possible values are given in quotes, for example 'value'. Do not
put quotes around these values in your email.
username | u
Your username. This is deprecated, and is only necessary if you
have not set an email password for the journal in
the properties form.
password | p
This should be the email password that you set in
the journal properties form.
An alternate, deprecated method that also works is to use your
login password, in combination with your username (see 'username'
option above). However, it's strongly recommended that you switch to
using the method of setting an email-specific journal password, since
this cannot be used for logging in should your email get intercepted
by someone else.
title | t = [text]
The page title (can also be given in the email subject, as title:
headline). Default is '(no title)', so you should give at least a
title in the email subject, or in the text.
headline | h = [text]
Optional page headline (can also be given in the email
subject, as title: headline). Default is blank.
date | dt | d = [date]
The date, if given, must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD
(year-month-day, with 4 digits for the year, and 2 digits for month
and day), for example 2010-01-30. Default is today's date.
distance | ds = [number]
Distance traveled for that day. A simple number, e.g. 23 or
23.4. The units will be assumed to be whatever is defined for your
journal (miles or kms). Default is 0.
size | sz = [small|medium|large]
Refers to the size of the heading in the Table of Contents, just
as in the website 'edit page' form, and can be 'small', 'medium' or
'large' (without the quotes). Default is the size of the previous page
in the journal.
style | st = [normal|bold|italic]
Refers to the style of the heading in the table of contents. Can
be 'normal', 'bold' or 'italic'. If you want both bold and italic,
then you need two separate lines, one for each. The 'normal' setting
turns off both bold and italic. Default is the style of the previous
page.
indent | in = [integer]
A number, usually 1 or 2, etc (depending on how you've structured
your journal). This refers to the 'Indent level' field in the Edit
Page form. Defaults to the indent of the previous page.
format | fm = [auto|list|manual]
Lets you specify one of 'auto', 'list' or 'manual'. This again
operates just like the website form: The 'auto' option means that all
single newlines in your text will be deleted, and double newlines will
be converted to paragraph separators. This is probably a good option
to use for emails, since many email clients hard-wrap your message
before sending it. The 'list' option is used for pages which may have
lists, where you want to retain the single newlines in your text. The
'manual' option is for text which you are formatting totally manually,
using HTML tags. This is only for those people who know what they are
doing, or who are pasting in text directly from an HTML editor of some
sort. Defaults to the format of the previous page.
border | bo = [1|0]
Sets whether pics posted in this email will have borders or
not. Possible values are 1 or 0. Default is 1.
update_timestamp | up = [1|0]
Lets you say whether the journal will pop to the top of the main
journal index or not. By default it is set to 1, because the main
timestamp for the journal is updated when you email an update. However
if you don't want the journal to go to the top of the journal index,
then set update_timestamp to 0.
text_timestamp | ts = [1|0]
Determines whether a text timestamp will be prepended at the top
of the posted or updated page. Possible values are 1 or 0; default is
1.
text_headline | th = [1|0]
Determines whether a text headline will be prepended at the top of
the posted or updated page. Possible values are 1 or 0; default is
1. Use this option in combination with text_timestamp above to
suppress the automatic headers that are added to updates on existing
pages.
visible | v = [1|0]
Set to 1 or 0, for whether the page will be visible or
not. Default is 1.
sequence | sq = [integer]
Post the page at the given sequence (integer). So if you want to
post your new page at the start of your journal, then you would put
sequence = 1. This option is of limited use for other sequences, since
you need to know the sequence of the page where you want to do the
insert, but it is there if you need it.
after | af = [title]
Post the page after the given title. So if you know you have a
page with the title 'Australia', then you can put this and the new
page will be posted after it.
before | bf = [title]
Post the new page before the page with the given title.
chapter | ch = [title]
Look for the page with the given title, and treat it as a chapter
heading. Then post the new page at the end of this chapter. This is
useful if you have pre-posted pages as chapter headings for, say, the
countries you are going to be passing through - e.g. Australia,
Europe, Americas etc. So then if you are currently going through
Australia, and have already posted a number of days under that
heading, then you can say 'chapter = Australia' and this will put the
new page at the end of that sequence of sub-pages. The script attempts
to deduce reasonable settings for the style (indent, bold etc), from
the previous page that was posted. If there is no chapter found, then
the page is posted at the end of the journal.
append | ap = [title]
Append this post on the end of the page with the given title. This
can be useful for making updates or "where am I" pages.
prepend | pr = [title]
Prepend this post onto the start of the page with the given title.
======== | -----------
Some email services tack on some advertising onto the end of your
message, so it can be useful to be able to say where the actual end of
your text is. If you start a line with three or more '=' (equals) or
'-' (hyphen) characters, then that is seen as the end of your text
(and isn't included). If you put this, then everything after
this line will be discarded.
Here's an example of a message body, using abbrevations for the options:
p = xxxxx
ds = 65
dt = 2003-04-23
Well, today was a hard day, we went all out to get to where
we were going!
And that was today, but tomorrow's another day!
===========
As you can see, we specify here the distance and date for the
entry, followed by the text for the page. We separate paragraphs by
leaving a blank line, just as in the standard Edit Page form. And
finally we terminate the message by the line of '=' characters (at
least three characters are needed). You don't need the last '===='
line unless you're using an email service that tacks extra crap on
the end of your messages.
You will not receive any reply to your message, unless there is a
problem with the options or formatting. In that case you should
receive an immediate reply (within a few seconds), with a single line
indicating what kind of error there was. If your journal entries are
valuable to you then it's probably a good idea to save your emails
until you are certain that they went into your journal successfully.
If you mail an update to a dated page which already exists, then
the new update will be appended to the end of the existing page
text. Every post gets a heading which indicates when it was received,
so there is no need to put that information in your email body.
If you send pictures as attachments then they will get posted to
the page as well. Pictures have to be in either JPEG or GIF format
(most digital cameras save photos in JPEG format these days). If you
put the ## filename ## codes in your email text (see inserting pictures) then the pictures
will be displayed at that point, otherwise the ## filename ## code
will be automatically added at the end of the page (just as happens
when you upload pictures using the web forms). Please note:
Filenames must not have any spaces or other punctuation characters -
safest policy is to use just the normal alphanumeric characters here
(i.e. a-z and/or numbers). If you want to supply a caption for the
pictures, then you have to include the ## filename ## code in your
email text, and the caption simply goes right after the filename in
the code - for example if you sent a picture named mypic.jpg, and you
wanted a caption which said "Hello world" then you would put the code
as ## mypic.jpg Hello world ##. If you put no caption then it will be
blank.
Some email programs automatically name the attachments, which can make
it cumbersome to put captions in the text using the filename. So,
there is an alternative method, which is to use the sequence number of
the attachment, starting from 1. If you do this, then you would use
three '#' instead of two, followed by the pic number and then the
caption, e.g. ### 1 here's the caption for pic 1 ##.
The #*# notation can also be used in the text to denote where you
want pictures to go. So if you are attaching, say, three pictures with
your email, and want these to be interspersed in your text, then just
put #*# wherever you want the pics to appear, then attach the photos
to the email, and when it is processed on the server the ## filename
## codes will replace the #*# placeholders as usual. And finally, you
can specify captions with this notation, by using parentheses directly
after the hash code. There must not be any spaces between the hash
code and the opening parenthesis. So for example, #*#(here is a
caption).
The picture attachment feature will not be useful to people using
small, text-only devices, but there are increasingly cases where it is
practical - for example, some digital cameras have an option to
generate a smaller, "email friendly" version of your photos. These
images are smaller and easier to upload than the high-resolution,
full-sized versions. So, if you have a portable computer that can
connect to the internet using a modem, you could potentially send
small versions of your pics from the road via email, and then when you
get home replace them with the high resolution versions.
This email posting option is simply intended to allow you to post
new entries to your journal from the road. I assume that later you
will probably be getting to a real Web browser and tidying up,
formatting and adding pictures etc. So the email feature is not
intended to replace the Web interface, but rather just be a
convenience for posting from the road. Let me know if you have any
problems with it, or suggestions.
Random notes:
The keywords are case insensitive - e.g. 'Username' works
the same as 'username'.
Passwords are always case sensitive, so 'ABC' is different
from 'abc'.
The spaces on either side of the equal sign are optional -
e.g. username=neil is the same as username = neil.
Any title/headline embedded in the body of the email takes
precedence both over the title/headline in the subject of the
email and over the title/headline already on the page. Any
title/headline in the subject of the email takes precedence
over the title/headline already on the page.
It is possible, via the subject of the email, to replace
the title without replacing the headline. Replacing the
headline without replacing (or respecifying) the title,
however, is not possible.
The distance in the body of the email, if any, will
replace the distance already on the page. Otherwise the
distance on the page remains unchanged.
You cannot email updates to a journal that has been marked
as 'complete'
(see properties
form). If you do this, then the email processing script
will treat it as spam, and drop the email without any error
message (the reason for this rule is that over the years,
somehow spammers got hold of a few of the journal email
addresses, and once an address is in those databases, it is
there forever). This rule should not affect most people, since
the whole point of the email updates is to make it easier to
update your journal from the road, and if the journal is
marked as 'complete' then that implies you're no longer on the
road. It is just something to be aware of, if you have become
used to emailing updates, and then mark the journal as
'complete', and wonder why the updates don't work any
more. The simple workaround here is to simply not mark the
journal as 'complete' until you really are done with your
updates.
Status updates using SMS (text message)
Sometimes you may just need or want to update your journal with a
quick status update, just to let people know you are still alive,
where you are etc. Modern phones often have the ability to send short
text messages
using SMS, and at times
this might be more convenient than finding a good WiFi connection or
sending a full email update; also,
there are times when you can't even get good voice service on your
cellphone, let alone internet access, but texts can still get
through. So, this option allows you to take advantage of this: You can
send updates to your journal via text message. Actually, this feature
doesn't really use the SMS protocol directly; it depends on your
provider being able to forward texts to an email address. So what you
do here is send your text update to a special email address associated
with your journal, along with a password that you defined previously,
and this will be converted by your service automatically into an email
message which is then forwarded to the web server for
processing. Here's what you do, step by step:
Preparation: Give your journal a handle and email password,
via the journal properties
form. For the purposes of this example, say you choose the handle
'abc' and email password 'xyz'.
Where to send it: Send your text message to the website
using the journal handle, e.g. abc@crazyguyonabike.com. NOTE: DO
NOT use your login username! It has to be a journal handle, otherwise
the webserver won't know which journal to deliver the update to.
Message format: The message must start with your email
password, followed by one or more spaces, then the actual text of your
message. This is a small security device just to make sure that
spammers and other people can't send arbitrary status updates to your
journal (obviously, for this reason you should keep your email
password to yourself). For example, if you chose 'xyz' as your email
password, then your text message would look something like this:
xyz I'm ok, just camping out in the Mojave desert tonight - back with regular updates soon!
The message length should not exceed 250
characters; in reality, most SMS messages can't be longer than 140
characters, but I want to make this clear just in case your text
service somehow allows construction of longer messages. Stay within
the regular limits, otherwise it might not work at all.
It's important to note that the email password MUST be the first
word in your text message, followed by a space. This shouldn't present
a problem in most cases, as SMS providers usually forward texts as
plain text emails. However if your provider uses HTML formatted
emails, then you may have to add a special sequence of characters in
front of your password so that my script can find it inside all the
other junk. This sequence is '+++', i.e. three 'plus' symbols, and
they should be places directly before the password, without any other
spaces. So for example:
+++xyz I'm ok, just camping out in the Mojave desert tonight - back with regular updates soon!
If you make a mistake such as omitting the password, then you may
receive a reply to your phone informing you of the error. Please note
that you cannot reply directly to this notification message to correct
the problem, because it comes from a system email account
(notifications) and not your journal address. You need to send your
message again to your journal address, otherwise it won't work.
It's also worth noting that you can send status updates via
regular email as well as via SMS; after all, the webserver is
expecting the text message to be converted into an email anyway, so
you could conceivably just send an update via email and skip the SMS
step altogether. The same rules apply: The message should be plain
text (not rich text or html), with the first word being the email
password. The email 'subject' doesn't matter, and will be
ignored. This option might be useful if for some reason you happen to
have access to email, but not full browser or text messaging via your
phone.
The journal author can also post updates via the web interface
(i.e. using a browser), by clicking on 'Status' in the navbar and then
clicking the 'Post' subtab. You can also edit and delete individual
status updates on the same status page, by clicking on the little
icons to the right of each post. The
icon edits the post, and the
deletes it. You will have a confirmation before completing the
deletion operation.
When you have posted an update, it will be displayed on your
journal's title page, just above where the table of contents
begins. Please note that the update may not appear instantaneously;
the script for processing incoming emails on the webserver is run once
every minute, so there may be a perceived delay of up to a minute
before you see it. The status will be shown in red on the same day it
was posted, then green until it is a week old, then it will drop off
the title page. You can see a list of all the status updates that have
been posted to a journal by clicking on the 'Status' link in the
navbar while reading the journal. There is also an RSS option in the
navbar to allow people to subscribe to your status updates, if they
use an RSS reader or service. Finally, note that journals marked as
'complete' will not show status updates on the title page (since this
is a service for journals "in progress").
Please do not use this feature as your sole method of maintaining
your journal on the road; it is intended as a way for you to let
people know your status during those times when you are out of regular
internet contact. Your journal won't be very interesting to read if it
just consists of short status updates; if that's all you want to do,
then Twitter is probably a
better venue for achieving that. That said, you may use the status
updates as much as is needed - just please use common sense, and
update your journal properly as time and access permits.
Editing Pics
If you are logged into the website then you will be able to click
on the "Edit" option in the navbar while viewing the pic you want to
edit. You are then able to edit the filename and caption for the pic,
and rotate the image if so desired.
If you change the filename, then it is automatically also changed
wherever you include it in your text (the ## file ## code) - but this
works only for the page where the pic "lives" - if you referred to the
pic manually in any other pages in your journal (which you can do
simply inserting the ## filename ## code in the text) then you will
need to change those references yourself. The automatic renaming only
works on the "official" page which the server knows is linked to the
pic.
You are also able to change the page which the pic belongs
to. You will see a dropdown menu in the Edit Pic form, with a list
of all the pages in the journal currently. The page which this pic
currently belongs to is automatically selected. If you want to move
the pic to another page, then select the desired page, make any
other changes you want to the caption, filename etc, then click "Done"
as usual. The database will be updated to remove the picture from the
old page, and add it to the new one. The picture code (## filename ##)
is also automatically removed from the old page and appended to the
new one.
Deleting Journals / Pages / Pics
You can opt to delete a journal from the "Properties" page (go to
the table of contents, click Edit, then Properties).
If you choose to delete a journal, then you are first warned that
you are about to also delete all pages, pictures and the message board
associated with the journal. This is a fairly drastic measure, and
should generally only be done as a last resort, or if you just
recently created it and there isn't really any content.
If you delete a page, a similar confirmation screen informs you
that all pictures associated with that page will also be
deleted. Deleting a pic has the usual confirmation as well. So you
have a chance to say "cancel" if you got to that page by mistake.
Deleting By Mistake
If you make a mistake and unintentionally delete a valuable
journal anyway, then contact me; your journal may be
recoverable. This is because when you delete a whole journal, the data
is not immediately destroyed; it is merely marked for deletion (and
hidden from view on the website - kind of like being put on "death
row"). The database will be cleaned up on an occasional basis,
deleting "for real" journals which have been on death row for a good
while (i.e. months). This allows mistakes to be made and relatively
easily corrected. However this only applies to whole journals; if you
delete a picture or an individual page in a journal, then the deletion
is immediate. Backups of the website are made nightly to tape, and the
backups go back 10 weeks. Also, regular permanent backups are made to
CD-R. However restoring backups from tape can be a tricky and time
consuming business, since it is only one small part of the database
which is being retrieved. So if at all possible, try not to delete
valuable content in the first place please!
Maps
You can post maps in your journal or article, which will be
embedded like pics. If you want to post a route, or any other
information that might be best expressed using a map, then you can use
the 'Add map' button on the page edit form in your journal or
article. There are lots of powerful features which allow you to plot a
route using "snap to road" routing. You can also place annotated
markers to show features and make comments on locations along the
way. There are elevation profiles, full-screen mode, and other handy
features that make hosting a map in your journal or article
easy. Route lines can have multiple colors, and you can have multiple
lines per map.
It is recommended that you use this feature rather than creating
your map elsewhere and then taking a screenshot to post in your
journal, because when the map is created on this website, the route
data is stored locally here in the server database. This will allow us
to do all sorts of cool stuff down the line, such as tie all the maps
together into one big map that people can browse. Imagine looking at a
map, panning and zooming to a particular region that you are
interested in, and being able to see who else has been there. By
integrating all the maps together in the database, this will be
possible. But when you post your map on some other website or software
(such as Garmin's BaseCamp or whatever), then that map data is lost to
us - it's not in the database, so it won't be browsable down the line
when I implement the global map browser. So, please do use the 'Add
map' button here rather than posting screenshots of maps. There are
powerful tools that let you plot a route, you can even import routes
from other sources by uploading files (GPX, TCX, FIT or KML).
See the Maps section for details.
Publishing your Journal
Publishing is an important step in writing your journal or
article. Basically all "publish" does is make your document visible to
the world. Before you do this, only you can see it, under the 'My'
page. This feature is there to allow people to work on their opus in
private if they so desire, only revealing it to the world when they
are ready.
You publish via the Edit
Properties form. The 'publish' checkbox is down near the end of
the form. Check that, and then save the form. Note that before you can
publish, you may need to set
the categories
and locales. If you get an error
message talking about categories or locales when you try to publish,
then just go and set those, and then come back to the properties form
and try again (hint: look for the Categories and Locales subtabs up in
the navbar). Lastly, you do need to have at least one page in the
journal before you publish. This is to stop people from publishing
without any content at all; there has to be something there to
publish!
Note that you only need to do the "publish" thing once; all it
really does is make the journal visible to the world. You don't need
to re-do it every time you add a new page to the journal. Once the
journal is published, any new pages will automatically be visible to
readers, unless you explicitly make the page invisible (there is a
'visible' checkbox on the page edit form for hiding pages until you're
ready).
You can also "unpublish" your journal anytime; this will make it
invisible to the outside world. If people have bookmarks or links to
it, then they will get a "forbidden" message, or be asked to log
in. Of course you, as the author, will still be able to see it
(assuming you're logged in - if you want to check to make sure it's
not visible to the outside world, then you can bookmark it, then log
out, then go to the bookmark and refresh the page).
Please be aware that whenever you unpublish your journal, then all
your pages need to be removed from the site search index (obviously
you don't want your journal showing up in search results if it's not
visible). Updating fulltext indexes is not a trivial operation - the
more pages your journal has, the more work will need to be done (it's
automatic, but I'm talking about server resources). And then, each
time you re-publish, all your pages will need to be re-indexed
again. So please don't repeatedly publish and unpublish your journal -
it's really a decision that you should make fairly infrequently. Also
note that you can make individual pages in your journal visible or
invisible, if you wish - this is a way for you to keep certain pages
"private" in a published journal until they are ready for the world to
see. So unpublishing should be a fairly infrequent occurrence; that
said, you are free to do it whenever you need to.
Finally, unpublishing your journal will not affect what Google has
in its search index; if your journal has been published for any length
of time, then it may have been visited by Google's web crawler, and so
it will then show up in Google searches. If you unpublish, then when
people click on those links in Google's search results, they will get
a 'forbidden' page. However, Google can also cache pages, so people
may still be able to see your page in Google's cache (at least until
Google crawls the site again, which could take an indeterminate amount
of time). The point is, unpublishing an established journal may not
immediately erase it completely from the internet, since search
engines outside of my control can cache page content. Only publish
your journal if you are really ok with the world seeing what you
wrote!
Marking your journal as 'Complete'
Once you have completed all the major work, then you should
signify this to the readers of the site by marking your journal
'complete'. Doing this says to people "I am mostly done, this is a
complete work that can be read from start to finish without you, the
reader, being left hanging and wondering what happened". So it's just
a visual cue, nothing more. Marking your journal 'complete' doesn't
mean you can't add pages, or delete, or edit, or do anything else. It
just sends a certain message to the reader. That said, it is an
important step in the editing of your journal: It says to me, the
webmaster, that your journal has some closure, and has not been
abandoned. Occasionally the webmaster (or other designated editors)
may "unpublish" unfinished journals that have obviously been abandoned
for a long time. If your journal is marked as being "complete" then
the chances of it being unpublished for being abandoned will lessen
considerably, since it demonstrates that you, the author, have taken
enough care to try to reach some closure with the document. You may
not have completed the trip that the journal was about, but at least
finish it off for the reader, and then mark it as 'complete' when
you're done - it's just a courtesy to the readers of this site, and to
me, the webmaster.
To mark your journal or article as 'complete', you go to
the Edit Properties form, check
the 'Completed' checkbox, and save the form. Again, you can still edit
your journal! This is only a visual cue to your readers (and me) to
say that the bulk of the content is there.
How Hitcounts Work
Hits are counted on your journal as soon as it is
published. Before publication, hits are ignored. Once published, any
browser request for the table of contents, or any page, pic or
slideshow page from your journal will be counted as one hit. Requests
from web robots such as Google are not counted. Thus the hitcount does
not reflect the number of people reading your journal, but rather how
much people are reading it. If you have a lot of pictures and/or pages
in your journal, and it's interesting and well written, then people
will be going from page to page and you'll inevitably get more
hits. If there are many pics on one page, and the reader loads just
the page, then that counts as one hit. But if each pic is requested
separately (using the slideshow feature), then each of those requests
will count as one hit.
If you have friends and family reading your published journal as
you're writing it from the road, then you will likely see a lot more
hits than normal, since these people are likely to be checking back in
every day, possibly several times. After you've finished your journal,
the hitcount will most likely slow down.
On the first day of publication, you may notice that the hitcount
says "0" for a while - this is because the hitcounts are only
calculated once a day, from the server request logs. This usually
happens sometime in the middle of the night. Thus you will generally
only see the hitcount change once a day, even though many people may
be reading your journal.
Note: If you are logged in and request a page that is from a
journal where you are listed as one of the authors, then that will not
be included in the hitcount for that journal. The script that
processes the server logs has code specifically to check for whether
or not the request is one of the doc owners, and if so then the hit is
not counted.
Using the Forums and Guestbooks
Forums and guestbooks are just different types of message
board. When you post a message, it appears on the website and other
people can read and reply to it. It's different from email, since the
discussion is more open and many people can participate. Thus a
discussion on the forums can be much richer than one conducted via
email, since people who you may never have otherwise met will often
contribute and lend their expertise.
Each board contains messages, and these messages are organized
into discussions, or "threads". A thread is an original post, along
with all its replies. Any post that is not a reply to some other post
is by definition a new thread. If you want to reply to a message, then
click on the 'Reply' option in the message header. To start a new
thread, then click the 'Start new thread' button on the forum in
question.
So, to summarize: If you are contributing to a discussion that is
already under way, then use 'Reply' to reply to whichever message it
is that you would like to respond to. If you are starting a new
discussion, or asking a new question etc, then start a new thread by
posting using the 'Start new thread' button. The only difference
between these two options is that the 'Reply' option will
automatically associate your new message with the one you are replying
to, so that other people can see the relationships and follow the
discussion.
The Forums consists of a number of message
boards relating to different aspects of Bicycle Touring. Each journal and article also gets its own dedicated message
board, called a guestbook. These work just like the forums, and allow
people to get in touch with journal authors. Messages which are posted
in guestbooks automatically cause a notification to be sent to the
author. When you reply to a message, a notification is also
automatically sent to the person you are replying to.
Messages in the forum message boards and journal guestbooks can
contain HTML as specified by the Allowed
HTML Tags section. Only the message body may contain HTML, not the
subject or any other fields.
The main Forums page also has an option that you can set in the Options page, for how you view the topics and
threads.
Posting Pics and Maps
If you are logged in, then you can post pics and maps with your
forum and guestbook posts. When you preview your post, you will see
(if you're logged in) a button for 'Upload pic or file', and another
for 'Add Map'. Clicking on either button will post your message, and
then take you to a form for uploading a pic or map. After you're done
uploading, you are returned to the posting form, where you can either
click 'Finish' or upload more pics. See the Maps
section for instructions on how to add maps.
Instructions and Rules for Posting Messages
You can post as a Guest or as a Registered
User.There is no need to register for posting in the
journal guestbooks; however, the Forums are usually restricted
to posts from registered users only (this helps to reduce spam
and other abuse). If guest posting is enabled, then you can
simply enter your name and email address each time you
post. If you are redirected to the login page, then that means
guest posting has been disabled for this
section. Registering allows you to
post on any of the forums. Being logged in also saves some
time if you use the site more regularly, because registered
users have their name and email filled in automatically. Other
benefits of registration include the ability to write a
profile (something about who you are, your interests
etc). Your profile will be linked from every message you
post. As a registered user you also gain the ability to upload
files and pictures, and edit your messages (within a certain
window after posting).
Use 'Reply' to respond to messages.If you're
replying to another message, then you should use the
Reply option on the message you're responding to,
rather than the 'Create new thread' button. The author of the
parent message will then be notified of your response, and
your post will be part of a 'thread' of conversation that can
be followed back to the original post, thus maintaining
context. If you are responding to someone's previous post and
you start a new thread by just clicking the 'Create new
thread' button, then there will be no relationship between
your message and the earlier one, which is confusing for
anyone trying to follow the conversation.
If you are logged in, you can use 'Save as draft'
to save your post before posting it. If you do this, then you
are taken back to the guestbook or forum, and your draft will
not be visible. You can get back to the draft by either
clicking on the same message 'Reply' link again, or else on
the 'Post new thread' in the same board or guestbook. You can
have multiple drafts active at one time. All of your current
drafts are listed on the 'My' page. If you click on any of
them, then you are taken to the posting form, where you can
work on the draft and either re-save it as draft, or post
it. You can also delete a draft, by clicking on 'Cancel' in
the posting form, or the little yellow trashcan next to the
draft on the 'My' page. Old draft messages eventually get
deleted automatically (currently the time limit is 180 days).
Your email address is safe from spam.Your email
will not be displayed openly on the website, unless you
explicitly include it in the text of your message. Even email
addresses included explicitly in the message text are
automatically obfuscated to stop them being harvested
by spambots.
When you put an email address in text, it is initially
encrypted so that nobody can read it. In place of the email
address, people will see 'click to show email'. When the user
clicks on this, the actual address is decrypted and displayed
in clickable 'mailto:' format. You have to be logged in to
access email addresses in this way, so random spambots and
other bad actors cannot read it. Your email address is never
sold, rented or otherwise divulged to anybody unless required
by law (see the Privacy
Policy).
The forums are not the place to post links to useful
websites.You should use the Resources for this. The forums are for
discussion, whereas the Resources is a more structured
database which is more appropriate for collecting interesting
links, since it is organized by category, features and
locale. People are more likely to find your link by browsing
or searching the Resources, whereas in the forums it will
probably get lost over time, hidden by all the new threads
that get added constantly. An exception to this rule is where
you have a link which you think really merits discussion,
because it has some controversial or especially interesting
aspect. But in the general case, "reference"-type links should
go in the resources.
The forums are not to be used for promotional
purposes. Honest discussion about products and
companies are ok, but any posts which seem to be purely
self-promotional in nature, or posted for the purpose of
marketing or raising the visibility of a company or
organization, are not ok. In the case of Resource and
Classified forums (the message boards that are associated with
individual resources and classifieds), the person who posted
the entry should not start threads themselves for the purpose
of promotion. The Resource/Classified forums are primarily for
other people to ask questions and comment on the entry in
question; they are not places for the author/poster to try to
market under the guise of spurring discussion. Any posts that
do not adhere to the spirit of this requirement may be removed
without notice.
You will only be able to edit your post within a 3 day window. After that window has expired, you will no
longer be able to edit your message, so you should use the
'Preview' stage while posting to try to make sure you are
saying what you want to say, and the edit window just to
correct any typos. After that, you can clarify your post if
necessary by posting addendums to it; this is done via the
same 'Edit' link for the message in question. In extreme cases
(e.g. if there is personal or sensitive information that needs
to be removed), then you can request this via the 'Report'
option on the message. That allows you to report the message
to the webmaster, with a note saying what it is you want to
change. This should only be used in exceptional circumstances,
though - usually you need to make sure your posts are what you
really want to say. This policy was instituted in part so that
people could not go back and change what they said during
contentious debates, or delete their words "as if it never
happened". The thing is, it did happen, you can't take
back or "unsay" things you said to someone else. People need
to take responsibility for what they post online, since their
words have a real effect on other people. Please think before
posting, and only post words you are willing to stand behind,
otherwise don't post in the first place.
The website administrators reserve the right to delete
any post for any reason. All messages are monitored by
the webmaster. Spam, abuse or grossly off-topic messages will
be deleted immediately. Do not post the same message on more
than one message board or guestbook; this will be treated as
spam. Posting here is a privilege, not a right. Debate and
controversial opinions are fine; juvenile insults, trolling
and other forms of abuse are not. Finally, I am under no
obligation to remove any post or user profile that is
otherwise legal in content.
If you have any questions about what's appropriate,
then please contact me.
Forum Etiquette
These "rules of engagement" may be updated from time to time as I
think of new ones.
The Fine Art of Debate: It's perfectly normal to
have debates, and arguments are a natural part of
forums. However, always follow this rule of thumb: Don't
say anything online that you wouldn't be comfortable saying to
someone face-to-face. When arguing, do not discount the
other person's position in a disdainful or insulting
way. Present reasoned arguments, and remember that on the
internet, "having the last word" is a non-existent
luxury. This is something many people fail to realize; when
you cannot see the other person, and indeed will probably
never even meet them in real life, it's very difficult to
gauge what they are really thinking. The usual cues, such as
body language and vocal intonation, are not present. This,
combined with the fact that many people are just not very good
at expressing themselves in print, results in many
misunderstandings that can easily blow up into full
flamefests.
You can never tell when someone is just having fun by being
obnoxious, or maybe is having a bad day at work, is angry over
some personal loss, or is just externalizing grief and
anger. Remember that if someone seems to be a bit of an
asshole, then they are probably not happy with their own lives
in some way. Being nasty to other people is usually a result
of frustration with their own life.
If you find yourself getting sucked into an unpleasant
exchange, then the best thing is to just step away and leave
it for a day. Don't worry, nobody will think you've "lost the
argument", "accepted defeat" or just "given up". You'll
probably find that after 24 hours, you will have cooled off
sufficiently to realize how silly the situation really is, and
you'll be glad you just let the thing die.
If the other person is so determined to win the argument at
all costs, then just walk away - there's just no way you can
win with some people, and I have never seen any passionate
online argument that really fundamentally changed anybody's
opinions. In reality, all that usually happens is that people
get more and more entrenched, even in the face of facts and
evidence (they will, if necessary, simply resort to
questioning your sources, so you really can't win). If they
are becoming outright abusive, then contact me, or mark the relevant
posts with the 'Abuse' rating and I'll be automatically
notified.
Multiple postings: Do not post the same message in
multiple forums or guestbooks. Once is enough, more starts to
look very much like spam. The messages will most likely be
removed, and if you persist then you may be blocked from using
the site.
Revisionism: It's considered bad form to go back
and edit your past posts in order to change the meaning of
what you said and make yourself look better. Likewise, it's
not good to go and delete your own posts which are part of a
larger discussion. If you can't stand by what you posted, then
please don't post it in the first place. It's very bad manners
to engage people in discussion or debate, and then go back and
simply delete what you said. This makes it impossible for
people coming after to see the context of the discussion. It's
ok to edit your posts to clarify points, add thoughts and fix
typos, as long as it doesn't change the overall thrust of the
message.
Do not troll: Trolling is posting in bad faith,
i.e. posting controversial or inflammatory messages simply to
rile up the community and stir up outrage, or posting extreme
opinions that you don't really hold, but know will cause a
reaction. Some people obviously find this funny; such people
are almost always socially alienated, and feel no real
connection to the website and the people who make up the
community there.
Be advised that I will not hesitate to delete and ban anybody
who smells like they are trolling. I don't have to put up with
it, and I will not be held to any strict rules as to what
exactly constitutes trolling. It's one of those "I know it
when I see it" things. Look at these forums as being kind of
like a bar, and I am both the bartender and bouncer. If you
start behaving like an asshole, then you will be thrown out.
I should also emphasise that contrarian opinions are fine, as
are strongly worded posts, as long as they are not outright
abusive, are posted in good faith (i.e. you do not have some
hidden motive for posting) and as long as you are being
somewhat reasonable. You can even disagree with me (shock!
horror!). Just be advised that things that really get up my
nose include arrogant and/or dismissive behavior, religious
proselytizing, and anything that advocates or makes light of
harm to kittens. Sarcasm is ok, in moderation. Just remember,
I'm the bartender, and I have a large bat, and I'm not afraid
to use it. Enjoy! :-)
Abuse and Spam
There are various ways for you, the users of the site, to help
deal with abusive messages
and spam. Here is a rundown:
If you get spam or abuse in your own journal guestbook,
then you can delete these yourself - just click on the yellow
trashcan which is above the message (looks like
this: ). You'll be
asked to confirm, so you click on Yes or No as
appropriate. It's important that you not reply to these
messages before deleting them - if you delete a message that
has any replies, then it cannot be deleted completely; a stub
will be left (just saying "deleted") because of that reply. So
if you want to delete a message from your guestbook that
already has one or more replies, then the way to do this is to
delete the replies first - work your way up from the latest
reply that has no replies of its own. Work back to the
original message, deleting as you go, then you should be able
to get rid of it completely. If you have persistent problems
from a person who keeps posting abusive messages in your
guestbook, then please contact
me and I'll see if I can block them from accessing the
site.
If you see abuse or spam on the forums, or in someone
else's guestbook, then you can use
the Ratings system to flag it and
notify me. Use the 'Troll', 'Abuse' or 'Spam' ratings as
appropriate. You'll get a little popup confirmation, because
these ratings are not to be used lightly. But if it is clearly
spam or abuse, then please do use it! If 3 people use the 'Spam' rating on
a message, then it automatically gets deleted. So this is a
way for the community to police the forums even when I'm
asleep or otherwise not online. I will get an automatic email
when you use one of these ratings, and when I see that, I
usually simply delete the account of the spammer. If it's more
complex (e.g. a regular user posting abusive messages) then I
will take whatever action seems appropriate. You need to be
logged in, and have been registered for at least 30 days in order to
use the ratings system.
If you see a problem that needs more explanation than the
ratings allow for, or if you haven't been registered for 30 days yet, then you
can use the 'Report' option - there is a 'report' link on
every message, and actually each page on the website has one
right at the bottom of the page; so you can report problems
with any page at all. The form sends me an email, with a link
to the page (or message) that you are reporting, so it's
important to be on the relevant page when you click the link
(or click the 'report' link on the relevant message). The
report form has a text box that allows you to tell me what's
on your mind. It is preferable to use the ratings if
possible. You may need to be logged in to use 'Report' - I
originally left it open to guests, but I started getting spam
from it (go figure), so I restricted it to logged-in users
only.
If all else fails, then please feel free
to contact me directly - I
will do my best to help you!
Ratings
The Ratings allow users of the website to classify different types of content on the site with a variety of pre-defined descriptive words.
Things that can be rated include forum posts, pics, reviews, classifieds, resources, journals & articles (as a whole), and individual pages in journals & articles. For brevity, I'll just refer here to the object being rated as the 'post'.
The rating with the most votes is displayed at the top right of the post in question.
For example, if most people rated the post 'funny', then you see 'Funny (5)', which means five people rated it as funny.
In order to rate a post, click on the rating summary. A popup menu appears with the list of ratings.
The possible ratings, with their intended usage, are as follows:
Interesting - not necessarily useful, insightful, right or wrong, but nevertheless intriguing.
Useful - informative and helpful.
Insightful - displaying wisdom, insight and enlightenment.
Inspiring - makes you feel alive and motivates you to get out and do the same.
Funny - humorous content. Please don't use this sarcastically.
Great read - well written, evocative, addictive etc.
Great pics - excellent photos or other types of pics.
Agree - "thumbs up", opinions you agree with or otherwise condone.
Disagree - "thumbs down", opinions you disagree with, or find offensive, unpleasant, repugnant, unfunny etc.
Miscategorized - in the wrong category, and needs to be moved by the website admin.
Off-topic - veers way off the main topic of the website or thread, and so, while not malicious, probably doesn't belong here.
Troll - disruptive content posted in bad faith, with the intent of getting attention and provoking reaction for its own sake (see definition of troll).
Abuse - threatening, harrassing, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, abusive etc.
Spam - blatantly commercial and does not belong on the site at all (see definition of forum spam).
Not all of these ratings will always be available for all types of post.
For example, 'Great read' doesn't really apply to classifieds, but it does to journals, articles and resources.
Enabling Javascript in your browser will make the ratings functionality more convenient (e.g. popup menu rather than going to a new page) but it is not required.
Only users who have been registered for more than 30 days may post ratings.
To rate a post, simply click on the relevant word - e.g. to rate a post as 'funny', click once on 'funny'. Click on as many words as apply in your opinion.
There will be an asterisk next to ratings which you have previously selected for this post.
After you click, you will see the number next to the rating increase or decrease by one (and the asterisk will appear or disappear).
Clicking multiple times on the same rating for any post will toggle that rating on or off (increase or decrease the rating by one).
You can make multiple ratings for any post; for example, you can click on both 'funny' and 'insightful'.
Do not click multiple times in quick succession; you should wait until you see the number change up or down before clicking again.
If something is showing 'Insightful (5)', don't feel that you also have to use that rating. You can rate it 'Funny' if you want, even if nobody else has so far.
The rating summary may still show a different rating to the one you chose, if more people have voted for that other rating, but that's perfectly ok - remember it's just a summary, which shows the rating most people have used. Don't feel a need to just follow what other people have done, use your own judgment! If you think something is 'funny' rather than 'insightful', then use that rating. If enough other people also click on 'funny', then it will take over as the summary from 'insightful'.
To dismiss the ratings menu, click on the heading of the menu, or click on another ratings menu (on another post).
You may not rate your own posts.
In the case of the 'miscategorized', 'troll', 'abuse' and 'spam' ratings, the webmaster is notified immediately.
Posts rated 'troll' and 'abuse' may be deleted at the discretion of the webmaster and editors.
In the case of 'spam', ratings which have a score of 3 or more will be automatically deleted after a day or so (or sooner).
Having many of your posts rated as 'troll', 'abuse' or 'spam' will eventually result in your ability to post on the site being restricted.
Initially, being blacklisted from posting lasts approximately one day. Thereafter, each time you are blacklisted, the block time doubles.
The author of any post that has been unfairly flagged can dispute the action with the webmaster, by filing an abuse report on the post.
The website admins reserve the right to revert any ratings which have, in their judgment, been inappropriately applied.
If a rating is reverted by an administrator due to it being deemed inappropriate, then the user who made that rating will have a black mark added to their account.
Initially, the reverted rating block lasts one day. Thereafter, each time you are blacklisted because of reverted ratings, the block time will double.
After having a number of ratings reverted in this way (i.e. by the admin), the user will be blocked from rating for a time.
Please note that you can revert your own ratings without any penalty! You can just click on the rating to turn it on or off. The black marks only apply to ratings which have to be reverted by the admin - i.e. people who consitently misuse the system and necessitate action.
You should be very careful when flagging posts as 'troll', 'abuse' or 'spam'; DO NOT do this as revenge or because you simply do not like the person.
The appropriate way to register disagreement with a person who is not being a troll or abusive is to use the 'disagree' rating.
You can select in the Options whether you want to see the ratings at all, and also if you want to filter based on ratings.
If you choose to filter, then posts which have a 'troll', 'abuse' or 'spam' score above your threshold will be abbreviated, with a brief explanation of why the post is not visible.
Posts do not become filtered immediately upon rating the post yourself; you have to reload the page to see the effect of filtering.
Privacy: The relationships between ratings and the users who posted them will never be exposed on the public website.
They are however stored in the database, and may be viewed by the website admins for purposes of administration and to stop abuse.
Please use the Ratings system ethically.
This means rating content based purely on the quality of the subject matter,
rather than any personal relationship you might have with the author of the content, or even personal attachment to the subject matter.
This is important, because otherwise the ratings become largely meaningless.
This is a community website, and its success depends on each member's individual ethical judgement and dedication.
The Ratings Page
The Ratings page is a summary list of the
ratings that have been made by the users of the site. It can be viewed
as both a "What's New" and "Best-of" list. The default view is
latest-first (what's new). The form at the top of the page allows you
to select the following criteria:
Type - the type of object that you want to see; for
example, if you're mainly interested in seeing pics, then select
that here. The only slightly confusing aspect of this might be the
difference between "Journals" and "Journal pages". It is possible
to rate both the journal or article as a whole, and individual
pages within the journal. To rate the journal as a whole, you do
this on either the Table of Contents or Thumbnails page. This
allows for a general overall opinion to be registered. But it's
also useful to be able to capture more finely focused opinions
about particularly useful or interesting pages within journals; for
example, there might be a really long journal that has a
particularly good page on the equipment used. Similarly, people
might rate an individual pic or page as 'insightful', but that
doesn't mean the journal as a whole is insightful. So then it makes
sense to be able to rate pages by themselves, independently of the
journal as a whole. Ratings for individual pics and pages do not
affect the rating for the journal as a whole; so if you want to
rate a journal highly as a whole, then make sure you do this in the
Table of Contents or Thumbnails page.
Rating - if you want to view by rating, then select it
here. For example, to filter out everything but the funny content,
select 'Funny'.
Order - you can opt to sort the results either latest
first (what's new), or by score (best of). The latest-first option
uses the dates when the ratings where updated on the objects in
question. The 'score' option uses the summary score for the object
(which is calculated from the rating that received the most points
for that object).
You can combine these options in any way to get interesting views
on the ratings. For example, you can see all the latest funny pics, or
all the most 'useful' articles. Click the 'Go' button to submit the
form and see the results.
You can page through the results in the usual fashion, by using
the 'next' and 'prev' options in the navbar, and also clicking
anywhere in the gray graphical slider (which shows where you are in
the sequence of pages).
Locales
A "locale" is a place in the real world: A country, state,
province, county, town, lake, park, etc. The Locales database is a
worldwide hierarchy of over 2 million places, all the way down to the
town level. You can associate journals and resource entries with the
relevant locales; the idea is that people can then find journals and
resources by locale. Thus you can for example, find all the journals
associated with a particular town, and so on.
The locales data was culled from the freely available USGS
GNIS (for the USA) and NIMA GEONet (for the
rest of the world) databases. These data sources, while apparently
comprehensive, are actually quite spotty and incomplete in places. For
example, the NIMA database often has no associations between places
and the state/province. So for example in Switzerland we have
thousands of towns with no idea of what part of Switzerland they are
in. This presents a problem for presenting the information, since it
makes much more sense to break countries down into state/provinces and
then places. If you just list all the towns in a country at once,
there are way too many to be practical. So, over time, I hope to fix
up this data to make the correct associations between places and
provinces. In the meantime, I have simply created a special province
in each country, called 'Unknown'. All places which are unknown are
under these provinces. So if you see a place which has 'unknown' as
part of the name (e.g. Switzerland > Unknown > Leysin) then this is
simply an example of a place for which we don't yet have a province
associated. If you have trouble finding a town, then just try
searching for it (in the Resources there is a text box for typing the
name of a town to search for). If you find it under the correct
country and there are no other instances under that same country, then
it is probably the one you are looking for. You can select it, and
later on when the association is made, all records using those
locations will reflect the change automatically. If you can't find a
place that you know exists, then let me know and I'll see if there are
perhaps alternative spellings.
There are certain areas of the world which are currently
incomplete - the most glaring example of this is Northern Ireland,
which actually has no entries at all. I will be trying to fill in the
gaps as soon as possible, but given the amount of data involved, it
may take some time. Please bear with me, but do let me know about any
areas which you think are incomplete anyway - it helps to know what to
prioritize.
Maps
Google Maps have been
integrated with this website, so that anywhere you can upload a pic,
you can also define a map which will then be shown embedded on the
page. This should work with recent versions of all the major browsers
(Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, Safari). You need
Javascript enabled in your browser in order for the maps to
work. Here's how it all works...
Editing Maps
First, you start off with a map of the world. You can then zoom in
to the region you want. If your mouse has a scrollwheel, then you can
use that to zoom - I find it really convenient. Or, you can type an
address, town, country etc into the search box above the map and
Google will try to find that for you. If you type coordinates, in
decimal format separated by a comma (e.g. 44.35718, -107.02469), then
that location will be highlighted using a map marker. If you are in
'Marker' mode (see below) then the currently selected marker will be
placed at that spot. If you are in some other mode, e.g. line mode,
then a non-persistent marker will be placed on the map. You can just
click on the marker to make it go away.
Once you are where you want to be, then let's take a look at your
options over on the right side of the page. There are four main
"modes": Lines, Shapes, Markers and Spot Info. Only one mode can be
selected at a time. Lines should be obvious, that one lets you draw
lines on the map (for routes, mainly). Shapes is for drawing shapes
like circles, rectangles and polygons. Markers is for placing icons on
the map, for purposes of annotation. And finally Spot Info is for
getting information about spots on the map. Basically all these
"modes" do is determine what happens when you click on the map. I'll
look at each of the modes in more detail now.
Lines Mode
This lets you draw a line on the map, point by point. Just start
clicking, and you'll see how it works. There are additional options
which affect how the line looks, how routing is handled etc, and these
are covered below.
New Line
You can create multiple lines on each map. When you click 'New
Line', then subsequent clicks on the map will result in points being
plotted for a new line separate from any existing one. You do not have
to click 'New Line' at the very start of making a new map; there is
already a default line there, you just start clicking to plot it. You
only need to use the 'New Line' button when you already have an
existing line, and want to start another one.
Add/Insert Line Waypoints
This is the default line mode, whereby each click on the map is
plotting a new waypoint on your line. When you click, a new waypoint
icon is added to the line. If you click on the line itself, then a
waypoint is inserted into the sequence at that point. Each waypoint
icon can be dragged using the mouse to a different location on the
map. Depending on the routing that was used on this line segment (see
below for more on routing), the affected line segments will be
recalculated on the fly as you drag the icon. If you click on the map
outside of the line, then this is interpreted as adding a new waypoint
to the end, and a new line segment will be made from the previous last
point to the new one. You proceed like that, clicking to plot new
points. When clicking, new segments are made using the line width,
color, and routing options that are currently selected. Each icon has
a number which indicates its index in the sequence for that
line. These start at zero and can go up to 99. If you define more than
99 waypoints then the numbers start at 0 again, and the color of the
waypoint icons changes from red to 'teal'. It will be quite rare,
though, to have more than 100 waypoints on a map. For one thing that
would be quite tedious to define, and it would also make the map slow
to render on many computers. Generally, people will probably use the
routing options (below) to reduce the number of waypoints. You can
change the color, width and routing for your line on the fly by
changing those options on the right side of the page. Each new line
segment you define will get the current width, color and routing. You
can change those later by using the 'Modify Line Segments' option,
below.
Modify Line Segments
This mode allows you to change the width, color and routing for
line segments that have been previously defined on your line. A line
segment is the line between two waypoint markers. When this mode is
selected, then you will see checkboxes appear next to the line width,
color and routing options. These checkboxes allow you to specify what
you will be changing on the line segment when you click on it. So for
example if you only want to change the color, but want to leave the
width and routing unchanged, then you would check the checkbox for
color, and uncheck the other boxes. Then, when you click on the line
segment in question, only the options you have checked will be used in
the update.
Modify Whole Line
This lets you make changes to the line as a whole. Currently you
can change the width and the color of the whole line. To do this, you
just click on the option you want, and the currently selected line
will be changed to that. For example, click on a color box, and the
line will be changed to that color. Select a width, and the whole line
will be set to that width. Currently you cannot change the routing for
the line as a whole, due to a limitation in the rate at which routing
calls can be made to the Google Maps API. This is quite restrictive,
and there would need to be multiple calls, one for each line
segment. In tests, this resulted in a "rate exceeded" error, so until
Google changes their policy on this, route changes will have to be
made one line segment at a time (see 'Modify Line Segments' above).
Delete Line Waypoints
When this option is selected, then clicking on a line waypoint
marker will delete that marker. The line segments on either side of
the marker will be consolidated into one segment.
Select Line
When you have more than one line defined on a map, then this
option allows you to select which line you want to work on. Click on
the line you want to use, and it will become the current line. The
current line is signified by the waypoint icons - only the current
line's waypoint icons will be visible. Other lines will have their
waypoints hidden, and will not be clickable.
Delete Line
This allows you to remove unwanted lines from the map. Just click
on the line to delete it. There is an 'Undo Delete Line' option, which
allows for limited "Undo" functionality. The last deleted line will be
restored. If multiple lines where deleted, then this can be used
multiple times. However the 'Undo Delete Line' option only works
during the same session when the line was deleted - once the map is
saved, then this undo queue is cleared.
Undo Last Point
This button peels off the last waypoint from the end of the
current line. Note that it does not undo the last point that was
placed (which could have been somewhere in the middle of the
line); rather, it simply deletes the end waypoint and its associated
line segment.
Line Width
This allows you to set the width of your line to one of three
values: Thin, Medium or Thick. Usually a thick line is easiest to read
- thin ones tend to get lost easily among all the other lines that
Google puts on their maps. This option is also relevant for the Shapes
mode.
Routing
This determines what happens when you add new waypoints to your
line. If you select 'none', then each new line segment will be a
straight line from the last point. If you select one of the others
(Bicycling, Driving, Walking) then Google's Directions service will be
used to try to plot a course from the previous point to the new
one. This is sometimes known as "snap to road", as your line will
probably follow the nearest available roads. Sometimes, there is no
route available, in which case you will see an error alert telling you
of this, and you can try clicking somewhere else. Generally the
Driving mode will select routes that Google thinks would be fastest
and most appropriate for car travel; Bicycle mode will still use
roads, but presumably it will try to avoid main highways, and also
will use bike paths where available (though this is up to Google, not
me); and Walking mode will try to select routes more appropriate for
pedestrians. Sometimes there are not many options, but Google's
service will do its best (we hope). You can change the routing option
by line segment; i.e. you can have one segment in the line that has
Driving, and another that has Walking.
When plotting a line using Google's routing, you should try to
choose your next waypoints according to how obvious the route is from
the last waypoint. Obviously since Google is routing, you don't need
to click on every turn and street corner; Google knows how to route
from one point to the next, along whatever roads are available. So try
clicking a ways away from your last point, and see how it does. If the
route isn't optimal then you can add more waypoints in between
existing waypoints (just click on the line to add waypoints), and then
drag those waypoints with the mouse. You should see the route change
interactively as you drag the mouse. This is usually going to be a
much faster and easier way to plot lines that go largely by road, than
doing point-to-point manually.
Color
There is a palette of colors, with the currently selected one
shown just above the palette. To change to a different color, simply
click on the dedired color box.
Shapes Mode
This lets you draw and manipulate various shapes on the map (circle, rectangle, polygon).
Add/Edit
In Add/Edit mode, clicking on an existing shape will set its line
width, color and whether or not it is filled with solid color, or just
an outline. See the individual shapes below for details on how to
create and edit them.
Delete
When this mode is selected, then clicking on a shape deletes
it. There is an "Undo Delete Shape" button, which retrieves shapes
that have been deleted during the current session (once the current
editing session is over, then this undelete queue is cleared).
Circle, Rectangle, Polygon
When you click on the map (not on an existing shape) in Add/Edit
mode, you will see a very small dot appear where you clicked. Grab
this with the mouse (i.e. click on it and then, with the mouse button
still held down, drag the mouse) to expand the circle to the desired
radius. This is similarly true for rectangles. For polygons, you first
drag the initial point out to a single line; you will then see
additional drag points on the center of the line. You can drag those
points out to make other dimensions as desired. Each time you do this,
a new drag point appears at the center of the lines you created. This
should be fairly intuitive once you start to use it.
When you click on an existing circle in Add/Edit mode, then it
will have its color set to the current selected color, and the 'Fill'
checkbox will determine whether or not the circle is filled with a
solid color.
Markers Mode
This lets you add markers to the map. These markers can have a
variety of different icons, to signify different types of condition or
place that you want to note. You can also annotate these markers with
text, and sub-icons. See below for more details.
Add/Edit
In this mode, clicking on the map (not on an existing marker) will
add a new marker. The icon will be the currently selected icon, seen
in the list to the right side of the page. You can change the current
icon that will be used for new markers by clicking on the desired
icon. You should be able to see a small popup text which describes
what the icon is for, by hovering the mouse over the
icon. Incidentally, this set of icons came from the
excellent Map Icons Collection website by Nicolas Mollet.
Once a marker has been placed on the map, you can click on it to
add text notes. A popup window should appear, with a text box. Type
whatever you need in there, and then click 'Ok' to save it. Also,
clicking anywhere else on the map will close the window, and save the
text. While the window is open, you can add sub-icons from the list of
icons on the right; just click an icon to add or remove it. The
sub-icons will appear at the top of the popup window, above the text
box. The purpose of these sub-icons is to allow for situations where
more than one icon may be relevant to the thing you are wanting to
annotate. For example, for a campground, the main icon would be the
campground icon. But you might also want to add as sub-icons some of
the facilities that the campground has, like showers, grocery store,
ATM, phones and so on. Just choose the most appropriate main icon, and
then add whatever sub-icons make sense. Eventually, when the Maps are
integrated with the website search, you will be able to search by
icon, which may be a useful way to find services in a given area.
When a marker has text or sub-icons associated with it, then a
little '+' appears in the bottom right corner of the main icon as it
is displayed on the map. This is intended to help act as a cue to
inform the reader when there is additional information available by
clicking on the icon.
While editing the marker text, you will see any
pending Relations that you may have made. You
can check the boxes for the relevant links you want to include, and
these will then be included when you close the marker window. The
Relations are not actually made until you click 'Finish' and save the
map to the server. If you add relations like this, then the object
that is being linked to from the map will have the usual note of
"Links to this". When you click on that, then it will bring up the
map, with this marker automatically opened to show its note window.
Set Icon
This allows you to change the main icon on the marker. Select the
icon that you want from the list to the right side of the page, then
click on the marker you want to change.
Delete
In this mode, clicking on a marker will delete it. There is an
"Undelete Marker" button, which will retrieve deleted markers from the
current editing session in reverse order that they were removed.
Spot Info
This mode lets you click on the map to bring up a window that
tells you the nearest address to that point, as well as the
elevation. This might be useful for researching routes, or trying to
find out an address for a place you wish to contact.
Auto Center
If checked, then the map is automatically re-centered each time
you click. This can be useful for when you want to plot a line with
the map zoomed in, because you won't have to manually drag the map
often in order to stop going off the edge. But it might be annoying in
some circumstances, in which case you can uncheck it.
Scrollwheel Zoom
If you are using a mouse with a scrollwheel, then this option
allows you to take advantage of that for easier zooming in and out of
the map. If this is checked, then when you want to scroll the actual
web page up and down (rather than zooming the map), simply position
the mouse outside of the main map area, anywhere on the web page. In
other words, the scrollwheel zoom only works when the mouse cursor is
on the map itself.
Show Information
If this is checked, then there is a one-line window displayed at
the bottom of the map. When you move the mouse around the map, this
window displays the current latitude/longitude. Also, if you pass the
mouse over any lines you have previously defined, then this window
will show the distance between the two immediate waypoints, as well as
the total distance of the line.
Show Elevation
This shows an elevation chart at the bottom of the map, for the
currently selected line.
The elevation calculation uses freely available data from a couple
of different sources
(mainly SRTM
(with voidfill data
by Ferranti)
and NED).
The SRTM data is global, but not very accurate (3 arc-seconds is
about 90m square). The NED data is more accurate, but also slower to
calculate, due to the larger file sizes involved. The NED1 is accurate
down to about 30m, and NED1/3 is about 10m. NED only covers North
America (NED1 covers parts of Canada and Mexico, NED1/3 is only
USA). The selection of data source is automatic; it will attempt to
use the best (i.e. most accurate) one first. If it isn't available for
the area you are plotting, then it will automatically fall back to the
next best one.
A "smoothing" algorithm is automatically applied to the elevation
graph. This is useful when the elevation data has a lot of little
spikes or peaks and troughs which you know are not really an accurate
picture of the route. When this happens, it means the elevation data
for that particular route or region might be "noisy", and smoothing
can help to eliminate some of this noise. The algorithm used is a
parabolic filter, which takes a weighted mean based on points around
the one under consideration.
The elevation chart uses Google's Visualization library. The
elevations are in meters or feet, depending on what option you have
selected for units in the main Options form. If you run your mouse
along the chart line, then you will see a green icon appear and run
along the line, keeping pace with where you are along the X axis of
the chart. This helps to relate the elevations to the locations along
the line. You can click on the green icon to dismiss it. Clicking on
the chart will put up a small popup telling you what the elevation is
at that point, along with some other information like distance,
cumulative elevation gain/loss, and net gain/loss from the start.
Pan/Zoom To Fit
This will look at all the points you have on the map, including
line waypoints, shapes, and markers, and try to zoom the map so that
all of your points are visible. This is a useful button to press just
before saving your map, so that you can be sure everything is visible.q
Clear Map
This will remove all lines, shapes and markers from the map.
Uploading GPS Trackpoint Files
If you use a GPS (global positioning system) unit then it's
possible to save trackpoints as files which can then be uploaded to a
computer for processing. See the instructions for your particular unit
on how to do that. For the purposes of this documentation, I'll just
assume that you have a file accessible for uploading to the
website. Please note that the best way to do this is to have the GPS
save one trackpoint file per day (usually this is the default). This
fits in very nicely with the way that the journals are supposed to
work (one day per page), so you can simply upload where you went on
any particular day to the relevant page in the journal. Try to avoid
huge trackpoint files that cover multiple days, or multiple routes.
When you upload a file to the map, it will be used to define a
line on the map. This is easier than plotting out where you went by
hand, point by point.
On the map definition form, there is a file upload option just
below the map, where you can specify a trackpoint file for upload.
The recognized formats are GPX, TCX, FIT (Garmin), KML (Google) and
JSON. In all cases, the file must contain just one single line or
route, not multiple ones. If there are multiple lines, each with their
own start and end points, then the resulting map will look like a
mess, because my code will try to connect all the start and end
points. So as long as it's a single line, it should work ok. The most
common format is probably going to be GPX, as that is what is
generated by most common GPS units (Garmin). TCX is a similar file
format used by Garmin, which may be generated by their desktop
software. FIT is yet another Garmin file format (don't ask me why they
have so many, I have no idea). Then KML is one that is used by Google,
when you download a map from Google Earth or their own maps
product. So you can export from there and import the map
here. Finally, the JSON option is specifically for importing maps that
were exported from other maps on this same website. So if you have a
map elsewhere on this site, then you can download the JSON data as a
file (there's a link above the map when browsing), and then upload
the resulting file to another map.
It's worth noting that although each individual upload file has to
contain just one route, it is possible to combine multiple routes into
a single map, simply by uploading sequences of different routes in
separate files (which can be any of the accepted types). Each time you
upload a file to a map, any route defined in that file will get
uploaded to a distinct line on the map (remember that maps can contain
multiple lines).
How to upload a trackpoint file
To use this feature, scroll down to the bottom of the Map
definition form. First select the type of the file you are going to
upload (the 'Select file type' dropdown). Then click the 'Browse'
button in order to select the file from your computer. Finally, click
'Upload'. This will send your file to the map. After it is done
uploading, you should see the line appear on your map. At this point
the line is not yet saved on the server; you will still need to click
'Finish' to save it to the database.
You can, if desired, upload multiple files, one by one, to the
map. Each file will generate its own separate line. Be aware that
having many of these files on a single map can generate a huge number
of points that need to be plotted, so you should be careful not to
overload the map. A sign that a map is overloaded is when it takes a
long time to retrieve and render when being displayed. This will slow
down your readers' experience, and will not be good, so try not to go
overboard with having many huge files on maps on the same page.
When you upload a trackpoint file, it is saved so that people can
download it for use in their own travels. See below, 'Browsing Maps',
for details on how to download the file.
Full-screen Mode
There is a 'Fullscreen' button on the maps (look in the top right
corner), which will expand the map to fill the whole of your browser
window. If you want the map to be actually full screen, then you can
maximize the browser window to get close to that. When the map is
expanded, other parts of the map editing form become hidden, so there
is an additional 'Menu' button shown on the map, which serves to
toggle the map editing toolbar on and off. You can also show or hide
the elevation profile chart while in fullscreen mode - while visible,
it is shown in the bottom left corner of the map.
You will need to exit from fullscreen mode in order to save your
map, edit the caption etc. Remember to use 'Pan/zoom to fit' if you
edited your map in fullscreen mode, so that your map fits within the
smaller maps that are used for browsing the site (readers also have
access to the 'fullscreen' button while browsing, but you should try
to make your map visible within the normal map window size).
Browsing Maps
Lines When in browsing mode (i.e. not editing), lines
are shown with 'A' and 'B' icons to signify the start and end of the
route. In the event that one of these icons is obscuring some detail,
you can simply click on the icon to dismiss it (you can get it back by
reloading the page). The A/B icons are shown in green if there is no
trackpoint file associated with the line, or red if there is a file
associated. If there are multiple lines defined for the map, then the
A/B icons are not shown by default (this is because lines that are
contiguous with other lines may have overlapping start/end points,
which can make multiple A/B icons confusing). In this case, passing
the mouse over any of the lines will reveal the A/B icons for that
line.
Download options There are download links shown above
the map for each line that is defined. These are shown with the type
of file that will be downloaded (GPX, TCX, FIT, KML or JSON). JSON is
a special case which is a file containing ALL the data (lines, markers
etc) for this map, in a format which can then be uploaded to another
map elsewhere on the site. The other file types (GPX, TCX, FIT, KML)
are line-specific and will depend on how the line was uploaded
originally by the author; in the case where the line was defined
manually, then the file type is shown as GPX* (i.e. with an
asterisk). This denotes "manually plotted line", with the GPX file
being generated on the fly from those points (rather than just giving
you the original file that was uploaded by the author). If there are
more than 8 lines defined on the map, then the download links are not
shown directly. Instead, by default you will see text saying something
like "Click to show download options", and upon clicking that text,
the individual download links will be revealed. This is done in order
to reduce clutter on the page. Passing your mouse over the download
links will show the A/B icons for the relevant line (in the case where
there are multiple lines on the map), which should help to determine
which line you would be downloading.
Elevation profiles and other line info Clicking on a
line will bring up a popup window within the map, showing the total
distance of the line, distance from start & finish, as well as links
to download the file and display the elevation chart for this line. If
you select the elevation chart, then the A/B icons for the line will
be changed to yellow, to highlight which line's elevation is currently
being shown. Only one line's elevation chart can be displayed at at
time. To hide the chart, or display a different line's chart, simply
click on the line in question again, and then click the 'Show
elevation' or 'Hide elevation' link in the popup window.
Zooming with the mouse scrollwheel
When you are browsing maps, you can click on the map to toggle the
scrollwheel zoom on and off. It's off by default, so that it doesn't
interfere with page scrolling.
Fullscreen mode
There is a 'Fullscreen' button control near the top right corner
of the map. If you click this, then the map will be expanded to full
your browser window. You can maximize your browser window to make it
fill the whole screen if desired. Click the 'Exit fullscreen' button
again to go back to regular map size.
Resources
The Resources is a very flexible database of all kinds of
different resources relevant to Bicycle Touring. The
only criteria for being included in the Resources is that it must be
related somehow to Bicycle Touring.
The resources is a community database, so everybody is encouraged
to post entries.
Browsing the Resources
There are three ways to browse: By Category, Feature or Locale. If
you select any of these and then go to another, then you can combine
criteria together.
By Category
A category is something that a resource entry is, i.e. the
type, or description of what the resource is about. For example:
Website, Book, Motel. You'll see a list of the categories; if you have
previously selected other Features or Locales, then you will only see
those categories which exist for the other criteria.
By Feature
A feature is something that a resource has, i.e. a
characteristic or attribute. For example: 'Showers' might be a feature
of a campground; 'Maps' might be a feature of a website.
By Locale
A locale signifies where a resource is in the world, if
applicable. You start at the top level of 'Country', and zero in from
there down to the town level.
Posting Resource Entries
The Resources is an open database, which will only grow and
prosper if you, the members of the community, contribute to it. This
is not something that is entered by "experts", it is ordinary people
like you. So, you are actively encouraged to post entries.
Please note that only entries related to Bicycle Touring are allowed. Others will be removed.
To create a Resource entry, click on the 'Post new entry' link in
the navigation bar when browsing the Resources. The process takes
three main steps: Selecting categories, selecting locales, and finally
entering details and features.
Step 1: Select Categories
First, you choose the categories for the entry. This is a set of
checkboxes, where you should check all those that apply to the entity
that you are posting. Each Resource entry should relate to a
single, distinct entity - e.g. a person, place, business,
website etc. This means that you should not post one entry that
relates to a whole collection of businesses, unless they are all tied
together in some way. Think about a telephone book or other types of
resources. You might get a business that covers several of the
categories, in which case by all means check all the relevant
boxes.
Step 2: Select Locale(s)
Step 2 is choosing a locale (or possibly multiple locales). This
may be skipped, if the entry does not relate to any particular
location (e.g a website).
You can select a locale either by browsing the database using the
dropboxes - first selecting the country, then province, then town - or
else simply by typing in the name of the locale and searching for
it. The locales go down to the town level, and should include such
features as parks, forests, lakes and mountain passes. You should try
and find the closest locale to where you are talking about. For
example, if you are posting a campground that is in one of the
National Parks, then try searching for the name of the park. If the
place is on a lake, try looking for the name of the lake, and so
on. Similarly for routes, it might be useful to include any passes
that lie on your route, so try looking for them. As always, if there's
a place that you think should be in there but isn't, then let me know.
Step 3: Entry Summary, Features and other Details
The final stage is where you enter a Summary for the entry. The
Summary is like the subject of an email, and it is the line of text
that will be seen in the main resource listing. So you should choose
something that appropriately reflects whatever it is you are posting -
the name of the business, for example.
Next you have a bunch of checkboxes that comprise the 'features'
of the entry. Check all that apply to your entry.
After the feature checkboxes, we have the contact
information. Some categories don't have contact information, so you
won't always see this. Just fill in whatever you can, and remember -
this is not your contact information, but rather the
place/business/whatever that you are entering!
After the contact information is a checkbox that allows you to say
whether this entry will be visible or not - just keep it checked for
it to be shown, or uncheck it to keep it private for now. You might,
for example, post yourself as a Hospitality host, but if you go away
on vacation then you might want to take yourself off the
Resources. Just remember to re-check this when you return!
There is also a 'Personal' checkbox, which allows you to say
whether this entry relates to you personally - e.g. you're the owner
of the business or website. If you check this box then there will be a
guestbook which visitors can sign, and these messages will be
forwarded to you automatically. Non-personal resource entries do not
get a guestbook.
Note:
Guest users who are posting will not see these two
checkboxes (Visible and Personal). Instead, you will have to
enter your name and email address, so that the webmaster can
notify you when the entry is enabled.
The Update
timestamp checkbox determines whether the timestamp on
this entry will be updated as a result of the current edit
(i.e. when you click 'Save'). This is relevant to how the
entries get displayed in the main index. If the box is
checked, then the timestamp gets updated and the entry will go
to the top of the main index, since the main index is sorted
by time of last update. If the box is unchecked, then the
timestamp does not get updated, so you won't see the entry
shoot to the top of the index. Sounds simple? Well,
almost... there is an additional wrinkle, which is that some
people will inevitably try to keep their own posts at the top
of the index, by repeatedly editing them (while not actually
changing anything of substance - the idea is simply to "bump"
their own post so that it's more visible). To stop this, the
checkbox can only be checked once every n days, where n is a
number that can be set by the website admin. If n is 3, then
any entry can only go to the top of the index every 3
days. You can still edit it as much as you want, but this
means the main index won't be polluted as much by people who
are simply trying to get their post to the top. Please do not
edit your posts and check the 'Update timestamp' checkbox very
regularly, since this will annoy other website users who are
interested in seeing actual new content. If they keep seeing
your post popping to to the top of the list every couple of
days, then they may report it, and you may be restricted from
posting on the site. Just use common sense - it's fine to use
the checkbox if your ad simply hasn't had any responses in a
while; this is a good way to let people know that the ad is
still relevant.
That's about it for entering resources - once you've
completed Step 3, the entry is created and you can see it. You can
then edit it (using the 'Edit' link in the navigation bar) and add
pictures if you so wish (guest users cannot do this). The Edit option
takes you back to the main Step 3 edit form, and you will see that
there is now an option to add pictures. Pictures always help to convey
a better sense of a place, so please do post any that you think would
help.
Uploading Pictures to Resource Entries
After you have created a resource entry, you can if you wish
upload pictures to it. To do this, view the entry, and then click
'Edit' in the navigation bar. You will see the edit form, and near the
'Save' button there is the option 'Edit pics'. If you click on that
then you will see the form for uploading pictures.
If you click on 'Upload new Pic', you will see that this form
follows pretty much the same process as uploading pics to journals -
you have to select a file on your computer (using the Browse button),
and choose a filename to save as. You can also elect to rotate the pic
by 90, 180 or 270 degrees (this is useful for some digital camera
images that do not come pre-rotated).
Once you have uploaded pictures, you can also change the order and
delete pics. This is done using the form that you see when you first
click on 'Edit pics' from the main entry edit form. You will see a
listbox containing the filenames of the pics you have uploaded thus
far. You can select entries and move them up or down, or delete them.
By default the pics are listed at the end of the entry, in the
order which you defined. You can also embed the pics at specific
points in the "Notes" text, by putting a special code: ## filename
##. So you simply put the filename that you chose to save as between
the ## codes. For convenience, the filenames are shown above the pics
when you are editing the entry. This feature is most useful for
narrative-type entries such as routes, where the Notes section may be
quite long and it would be useful to be able to have pics appear at
specific points in the text. For example, if you had a pic that was
uploaded as view_of_the_sea.jpg, and you wanted to include it in the
Notes, then you would simply put
## view_of_the_sea.jpg ##
at whatever point in the text you desire.
Classifieds
The Classifieds section of the website is a place where you can
advertise items for sale, personals, jobs and so on. The only
requirement is that the ads be relevant to Bicycle Touring.
Browsing the Classifieds
There are three ways to browse: By Category, Feature or Locale. If
you select any of these and then switch to another, then you can
combine criteria together.
By Category
A category is the type, or description of what the ad is
about. For example: For Sale, Wanted, Employment, or Personal. You'll
see a list of the categories; if you have previously selected other
Features or Locales, then you will only see those categories which
have classifieds posted in conjunction the other criteria.
By Feature
A feature is a characteristic or attribute for the ad (these are
presented as a set of checkboxes when posting). Each category has a
different set of features. For example, a Job ad might have 'Full
time' and 'Temp' as features, whereas a 'For Sale' ad might have
'Bike' or 'Bookcase'. A Personals ad might have 'Non-smoker', and so
on.
By Locale
A locale signifies where the classified is in the world, if
applicable. You start at the top level of 'Country', and zero in from
there down to the town level. This is useful if you are looking to buy
or sell locally.
Posting Classifieds
Anybody is free to post a classified, as long as it is relevant to
the topic. The posting process is free, but the site operates on an
"honor system" of donations. In a nutshell, if you liked the service
and found it useful in some way, then you are asked to donate
something, whatever you feel is appropriate and can afford. The Donate page has more instructions
on the different ways you can give money.
In order to post a classified ad, You will first need to be
registered and logged in. To do that, click on My
in the navigation bar. This is required because you will probably have
to come back later to edit and eventually delete your ad.
Only ads related to Bicycle Touring are allowed. Others will be
removed.
To create a Classified, click on the 'Post' link in the navigation
bar when browsing the Classifieds. Alternatively, there is a "Post
Classified Ad" button on the classifieds page itself. The main posting
process takes three steps: Selecting categories, selecting locales,
and finally entering details and features.
Step 1: Select Category
First, you choose the category for the ad. Try not to combine a
whole bunch of unrelated items into one ad; it's usually better to
post separate ads, grouping things together only as makes sense.
Step 2: Select Locale(s)
Step 2 is choosing a locale (or possibly multiple locales). This
may be skipped, if the entry does not relate to any particular
location (e.g a website). Note that you can make this step faster when
posting multiple classifieds, by setting your locale in your profile
(My > Account). If you do this, then your locale will be
automatically set whenever you post a classified. You can of course
change it when posting, but the pre-setting should save some time in
most cases, since you probably want your locale to be your home town.
If you do need to select a locale, then you can do this either by
browsing, or else simply by typing in the name of the locale and
searching for it. The locales go down to the town level, and should
include such features as parks, forests, lakes and mountain
passes. You should try and find the closest locale to where you live
(usually the ad will be related to your home, unless you're
advertising for companions for some kind of trip, in which case you
might want to put the locales that will be relevant to that).
Step 3: Summary, Features, Notes and other details
The final stage is where you enter the Summary (headline) for the
ad. The Summary is like the subject of an email, and it is the line of
text that will be seen in the main Classifieds listings. So you should
choose something that appropriately reflects whatever it is you are
posting.
There may also be a Price field. You can fill this in if the ad is
for a single item that you are selling - otherwise, if you are
including multiple items in the ad (unwise) or if it simply doesn't
apply (e.g. Personals) then just leave it blank.
Next you have a bunch of checkboxes that comprise the 'features'
of the entry. Check all that apply to your entry. We try to include
all features that make sense for the different categories, but if you
feel that there are omissions, then do let me
know.
After the feature checkboxes, we have the contact
information. Some categories don't have contact information, so you
won't always see this. Just fill in whatever you feel comfortable
with. This information will be saved automatically, and pre-filled for
you the next time you enter another ad. This will save some time
filling out repetitive information, since your contact info will most
likely be the same each time you post.
After the contact information is a checkbox that allows you to say
whether this entry will be visible or not - just keep it checked for
it to be shown, or uncheck it to keep it hidden for now.
The Update timestamp
checkbox determines whether the timestamp on this entry will be
updated as a result of the current edit (i.e. when you click
'Save'). This is relevant to how the entries get displayed in the main
index. If the box is checked, then the timestamp gets updated and the
entry will go to the top of the main index, since the main index is
sorted by time of last update. If the box is unchecked, then the
timestamp does not get updated, so you won't see the entry shoot to
the top of the index. Sounds simple? Well, almost... there is an
additional wrinkle, which is that some people will inevitably try to
keep their own posts at the top of the index, by repeatedly editing
them (while not actually changing anything of substance - the idea is
simply to "bump" their own post so that it's more visible). To stop
this, the checkbox can only be checked once every n days, where n is a
number that can be set by the website admin. If n is 3, then any entry
can only go to the top of the index every 3 days. You can still edit
it as much as you want, but this means the main index won't be
polluted as much by people who are simply trying to get their post to
the top. Please do not edit your posts and check the 'Update
timestamp' checkbox very regularly, since this will annoy other
website users who are interested in seeing actual new content. If they
keep seeing your post popping to to the top of the list every couple
of days, then they may report it, and you may be restricted from
posting on the site. Just use common sense - it's fine to use the
checkbox if your ad simply hasn't had any responses in a while; this
is a good way to let people know that the ad is still relevant.
That's about it for entering Classifieds - once you've completed
Step 3, the ad is created and you can see it. You can then edit it
(using the 'Edit' link in the navigation bar) and add pictures if you
so wish. The Edit option takes you back to the main Step 3 edit form,
and you will see that there is now an option to add pictures. Pictures
always help to convey a better sense of a place, so please do post any
that you think would help.
Beware of scams! - when you post an ad, you may receive
email from people who appear to be interested in an item you have for
sale, but what they really want from you is money. See the Internet Scam
Alert website for details on how this usually works, and what to
look out for. I will try to put tools in place that block spammers and
scammers as much as possible, but since these people enter their
messages manually, it can be difficult to stop it completely. After
all, you do want people to contact you, that's the whole point of
posting the ad!
Knowledge is power - educate yourself and you should
be fine.
Uploading Pictures to Classifieds
After you have created the classified ad, you can if you wish
upload pictures to it. To do this, view the entry, and then click
'Edit' in the navigation bar. You will see the edit form, and near the
'Save' button there is the option 'Edit pics'. If you click on that
then you will see the form for uploading pictures.
If you click on 'Upload new Pic', you will see that this form
follows pretty much the same process as uploading pics to journals -
you have to select a file on your computer (using the Browse button),
and choose a filename to save as. You can also elect to rotate the pic
by 90, 180 or 270 degrees (this is useful for some digital camera
images that do not come pre-rotated).
Once you have uploaded pictures, you can also change the order and
delete pics. This is done using the form that you see when you first
click on 'Edit pics' from the main entry edit form. You will see a
listbox containing the filenames of the pics you have uploaded thus
far. You can select entries and move them up or down, or delete
them. Note that if you manually insert picture codes into the text of
the ad (see next paragraph) then this automatic ordering will no
longer be applicable.
By default the pics are listed at the end of the entry, in the
order which you defined. You can also embed the pics at specific
points in the "Notes" text, by putting a special code: ## filename
##. So you simply put the filename that you chose to save as between
the ## codes. For convenience, the filenames are shown above the pics
when you are editing the entry. This feature is most useful for longer
entries, where the Notes section may be quite long and it would be
useful to be able to have pics appear at specific points in the
text. For example, if you had a pic that was uploaded as my_bike.jpg,
and you wanted to include it in the Notes, then you would simply put
## my_bike.jpg ##
at whatever point in the text you
desire. Note that when you do this, the ordering of the pics which is
shown in the Edit Pics form will no longer be applicable. If you put a
pic code manually into the text, then it will not be shown at the end
as well, but the ones that are listed at the end will be shown in
their correct order.
Deleting Classifieds
Once your ad is done (you sold the item, or you otherwise want to
finish the ad), then you can do one of two things: If you want to
permanently remove it, then simply delete it. You can always find all
of your currently posted classifieds by going to My ->
Classifieds. Click on the ad, then Edit, then Delete. If you want to
take the ad offline temporarily, then you can uncheck the 'Visible'
flag in the edit form. This will hide it from view. You can go back
anytime to republish the ad again. Due to caching, there may be a
short time during which your deleted or unpublished ad is still
visible; but within a few minutes most people coming to the website
will not see it any more.
Relations
Relations are two way links which you can use to connect together
pages on this website. You are probably already familiar with Web URL
links (e.g. http://www.example.com/). These are one-way only, because
you can only follow them one way; there is no easy way to go in
reverse and tell what else links to the object in the URL. The main
idea behind Relations is to make links two-way. Thus relations operate
very much like regular web links, only they maintain additional
internal information that allows them to be two-way.
A relation, in this context, links a source page to
a target page. The source page is where you place the relation,
and the target page is where the relation points to. Both the source
and target are pages on this website. You can't use a relation to link
to a page on another website, since it depends on internal ids which
identify the objects being linked. To link to external web pages, you
would use standard URLs.
You can create relations between journals, articles (or individual
pages therein), pics, forum messages, resources, classifieds, polls or
user profiles. In other words, most of the things that you can post or
otherwise create on the website can be used on either end of
relations. You do not have to be the owner of the target page, but you
do need to be able to edit the source page.
To make a relation:
First go to the target page you want to link to.
Click 'Relation' in the navbar (pics have this right above
the pic, same for forum messages). This marks the page and
adds it to your pending relations list (viewable under My >
Relations).
Repeat this process for as many target pages as you desire
to link to.
Go to your source page, the one you want to make
the link(s) from.
Edit the page. For journals as a whole, go to the Table of
Contents, then Edit, then Properties. Otherwise, Edit should
take you directly to the relevant form (for individual journal
pages, pics, messages, classifieds etc).
The pending relations should be listed as checkboxes near
the end of the edit form. Select the relations that you want
to place here, then save.
That's it! You should be able to see the relations listed at the
bottom of the page you just edited. Relations are displayed
using this background color, in order to distinguish them from
regular links and pics.
Relations to pics have an additional special feature: The pic is
displayed inline where you placed the relation. This can be useful for
constructing compilation articles which refer to pics on other
journals, or for referring to interesting pics in forums
discussions. The benefit of using a relation (rather than re-uploading
the pic) is that it saves you time, and an attribution link back to
the original location is automatically displayed. Also, ratings for
the pic are preserved.
You can see the two-way nature of relations by going to view the
target page after making a relation to it. You may have to reload the
target page (since your browser caches pages, and you need to make
sure you're getting the most up-to-date version). You should see at
the bottom of the target page text looking something like "Show links
to this". If you click on that, it will expand and show you a list of
all the incoming relations that point to this object. Your new
relation should be on that list. This can be useful to see how and
where a page is being referred to or discussed on other parts of the
site.
There is an option for journal authors to turn off the "show links
to this". Some people don't like to have this displayed on their
journal without having any control over who links to it. So if you
don't see your relation listed at the bottom of such a journal, then
the author has probably used this option.
When you add a relation to a textual page (e.g. journal page or
forum post) then a special code is added to the end of the text. This
looks something like [Pic 1234]. This is a simple code that signifies
the type of the relation target (could be one of Doc, Page, Pic,
Message, Resource, Classified, Poll or Profile), followed by the
internal database id of the target object. You can move this code
around in the text if you like, to aid with formatting. You can also
add some text after the numeric ID, but before the closing square
bracket. Then this will be shown as a caption immediately after the
relation. This can be useful if you are using relations to display
pics from elsewhere in the site, for example.
Regular URLs which are included in the text are automatically
checked to see if they are pointing to pages within this website. If
so, then an "implicit" relation is automatically created when you
save. This implicit relation is seen in the "links to this" for the
link target, as described above. Implicit relations do not get the
square bracket codes, however, since the relation has already been
expressed in the text via the URL.
To delete a relation, edit the page where you originally added
it. There will be checkboxes near the bottom of the form. You can
either uncheck the checkboxes of the relations you want to remove, or
else you can also simply delete the relation codes from the text. When
you save, the relations will be deleted. If you remove a URL which
previously produced an implicit relation, then that will also be
automatically detected and the relation removed.
Options
The Options page lets you set various properties related to how
information on the website is presented. The options are stored in a
browser cookie,
which is a small piece of persistent information that the browser
saves. You need to enable cookies in your browser for the options to
work. Here is an explanation of the various fields on the Options
form:
Timezone
If you select your world time zone here, then the dates and times
which are shown in various places on the website will be automatically
converted to your local time. Otherwise, the default will be wherever
the webserver happens to be located, e.g. US/Pacific. If you want
timestamps to make more sense, then it's a good idea to set this
option. The date/time you select should take Daylight Savings into
account automatically.
Pic size
There are a lot of pictures in the journals on the website, and so
this option allows you to select different sizes for how the pics are
displayed. You can opt for no pics at all, or thumbnails, small or
large versions. The large size is simply the original size that was
uploaded by the author of the journal. The small size is usually
around 50% the original (unless the original was very small, in which
case the scaling may not be as much). The thumbnail size is around 10%
of the original. You should select appropriately based on your
internet bandwidth and screen size. Larger pics will take longer to
download, so if you have a dialup connection then you might want to
stick with the 'small' or 'thumbnail' sizes. When you select a smaller
size, then the pics are linked to the next larger version. For
example, if you are showing 'small' pics, then you can click on any
pic to go to the 'large' version. If you are showing 'thumbnail' size
then clicking on a pic will display the 'small' size.
Max pic display width
This can be a useful option if you have a monitor or screen that
is not very wide. When images are wider than the screen, then browsers
often introduce a horizontal scroll bar, which then requires
manipulation in order to pan across the whole page - obviously this
can get annoying. In cases like this, you can set the maximum width
(in pixels) that you would like pics to be shown at. This will ensure
that pics will always fit into your particular screen size - they are
automatically scaled down.
Website font size
This allows you to have some control over the size of the text
that is used for the non-content text of the website - e.g. menus and
other non-user-generated text. Useful for people who may need larger
text due to poor eyesight, or those with smaller screens who want to
avoid horizontal scroll bars.
Text font size
This is similar to the preceding option, only it applies to the
user-generated text of the site - i.e. the journal page content, forum
posts etc. Having two distinct options allows you the flexibility to
have, say, smaller "system" text while making the journal content
stand out more and still be easier to read.
Text display width
This allows you to set a maximum width (in pixels) for the
user-generated content of the site (e.g. journal pages, forum
posts). This can be useful for people who prefer to read text in more
narrow columns rather than always having it go all the way across the
entire width of the browser window. Studies have shown that it is
easier to read narrow columns of text than wider ones, so this is an
option for those who like that.
Small screen
If you check this option, then the website will be shown in a
format that is more "friendly" to small screens (e.g. smart phones
etc). What this mainly does is try to reduce the amount of information
being crammed into each line of text, so that we can avoid your
browser having to make a horizontal scroll bar. Basically we just
always want to try to fit everything on the screen, at least in the
horizontal plane, otherwise browsing gets very irritating, always
having to scroll left and right. You will see less information
displayed on the home page of the site, but you should still be able
to navigate to all areas of the website as before.
Journals listing
This option allows you to set how journals are displayed when they
are listed. You can choose between 'summary' and 'expanded'. The
'summary' option will display the journal lists in tabular format,
with the title, author, last updated time and current status. The
'expanded' format lists journals in list format, with more
information, e.g. journal description, categories, and start & end
dates. You will see that you can temporarily override this option
while you are browsing the journals or What's New pages - but when you
return to any of these journal lists, the option you selected here
will be used again.
Resources listing
This option is very similar to the Journals option described
previously. It allows for three formats when listing Resource
entries: Summary, Compact and Expanded. The Summary format is tabular,
and displays the one-line summary of the entry, along with an
indication of whether there is a link associated, and the
categories. The Compact format shows a bit more information, including
the locales (if any) and the full link (if applicable). The Expanded
format shows everything in each entry, including pictures. Note that
you can override this option while you are browsing the Resources - so
you could select 'summary' in the Options page, and then go into the
Resources and change to 'expanded' view. That view will then be kept
temporarily while you stay browsing the Resources pages, but if you go
elsewhere on the website and return to the Resources, then the option
that you selected in the Options page will be used again. Thus this
option is your 'default' for browsing the Resources, but can be
temporarily changed while you are browsing a specific topic or locale.
Classifieds listing
See the previous option for Resources listing; this is the same
idea, applied to the classifieds.
Forums overview
The main Forums page has three different ways to display the
messages and topics: Alphabetically by topic, By topic (latest
activity first), or by latest thread activity. This option allows you
to choose which format will be the default when you go to the Forums
page. You can override this option when viewing the Forums, by using
the option links on the page - but these changes will only be
temporary. The next time you visit the page, the options will be set
to what you choose on the Options page.
Forum display
This gives you the choice of how you view a particular forum -
either as a list of messages (latest first), or else as a list of all
the different threads (discussions). I think the threads option is
more useful, generally, especially where there are lots of different
discussions going on.
Thread display
This allows you to show threads either in chronological order
(i.e. earlier posts in the thread shown first), or nested
(i.e. showing replies indented below the parent messages that they are
in reply to). Usually I find the chronological option more useful and
natural, but there are times when you want to focus on a particular
sub-tree of replies, so this gives you that option.
Message style
This has options for 'compact' or 'expanded'. It mainly applies to
the placement of the various options for replying, printing,
reporting, ratings etc for each individual message in the forums. With
the 'compact' view, everything is shown at the top of the
message. With the 'expanded' view, some of the options are shown at
the end of the message.
Display ratings
You can turn the display of ratings on and off - see the Ratings section for more details on how that
works, also for the filtering functionality.
Filter trolls
This allows you to hide messages that have been rated by other
users of the site as being 'troll' (i.e. someone judged to be posting
just to get a rise out of the community). You can select the score
threshold that you want this to kick in, which relates to how many
people have rated that message with 'troll'.
Filter abuse
Similar to the previous option, only for the 'abuse' rating.
Filter spam
Same as previous, only for the 'spam' rating.
When you click the button to save the options, the cookie will be
sent to your browser, and the browser will then be redirected to a
location appropriate to where you were on the website when you clicked
on the Options tab. So if you were reading a journal, then you should
be returned to the page in the journal where you were previously. If
you were looking at the Resources, then you'll be returned there. If
you weren't doing anything in particular, then you are returned to the
Journal index.
Topics
This website is part of a network of sites which are gathered
together under a number of different domains, namely:
topicwise.com,
townwise.com,
profilewise.com,
bleepwise.com
and crazyguyonabike.com.
The idea is that these websites are all about having different online
communities that are centered around different topics, and each site
has a different focus - topicwise has subject-oriented topics,
townwise topics are locale-oriented (kind of like craigslist), and
profilewise is oriented around different categories of profile (for
individuals, groups, clubs, companies etc - kind of like
Facebook). Bleepwise is about micro-blogging and social news, kind of
a cross between reddit and twitter. Each site has largely the same
structure as this one, with some differences depending on the focus of
the site (e.g. townwise might have more of a focus on classified
ads). The original site
was crazyguyonabike.com,
which is all about bicycle touring. I developed crazyguyonabike over a
number of years, until I realized that the code could be applied to
other topics and online communities, e.g. hiking, travel, photography,
or just about any other subject you could think of. Rather than dilute
crazyguyonabike itself, which I wanted to keep focused on the bicycle
touring, I decided to build out the site using new domains, centered
around Topicwise. The other domains followed over time, and there may
be more - stay tuned!
You will notice that right at the top of every page, on the top
line, there is an indication of which topic you are currently on,
followed by "[change]". Here is an example screenshot of the top left
corner of the page to highlight what I am referring to:
You can click on 'change' (not in this image, but on the actual
webpage) to go to the topic directory. From there you can go to any of
the other topics.
There is also
an introductory
overview article on topicwise, which explains in a bit more detail
how the concept works.
Country Bans
Unfortunately I have had to block certain countries from accessing
the website, due to persistent abuse, hacking attempts and even DDoS
(denial of service) attacks. I should note that this is nothing
personal against the people who live in these countries; I know that
such activity is caused by a relatively small number of bad
actors. However when patterns emerge, and the hackers switch ip
addresses frequently (but staying within a given country's ip blocks),
then the only option is to block the entire country. It is just simple
and necessary self defense to protect my server and the users of my
website. If you are traveling and want to access the site from any of
the following countries, then you are advised to use a VPN service
based in a country that is not on the list. This list will be updated
occasionally. For recommended VPN companies, see the next section.
Here is a list of the countries that are currently blocked:
China
Russia
Ukraine
VPN Services
A VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a way to
tunnel through various types of firewalls that can otherwise prevent
you from accessing websites and services on the internet. It provides
you with an anonymous IP address. I would recommend paying for a
reputable service rather than trying to use one of the "free" ones out
there. The problem with free is that if they aren't making money from
you, then they are making money from someone else, and who knows how
they are using your information to do that? So I prefer to pay up
front, then you know they are serving you, and not some other agency
that you know nothing about.
I am personally using ExpressVPN. I went with them initially mainly
because they seemed to have a good reputation, consistently coming up
with good (and often top) marks in surveys of the major VPN options
that are out there. They also had good instructions for getting their
service going on Linux, which is my platform of choice. So, for what
it's worth, I can confirm that they are for real, and their service
works very well so far. They have a wide variety of servers in
different countries for you to select from, and the speed seems more
than adequate. If you're looking for a good place to start, you could
do a lot worse than ExpressVPN.
Another VPN service that seems to get good reviews
is Astrill. I
haven't used it myself, but it has come up in discussions here and
seems to be well regarded.
Conclusion
I hope this help document was useful to you - if there's anything
it didn't answer then take a look at
the FAQ, also under the Help section. And
if you are still confused then get in
touch with me and ask the question directly. If it's a point which
I've missed here then I'll add it!
