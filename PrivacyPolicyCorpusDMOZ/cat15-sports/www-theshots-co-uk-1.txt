Visitors to our website:
At various times during a visit to this Website you may be asked to provide us with personal information (for example your name and contact details). This may be in connection with activities such as registration for newsletters, operation of our subscription services, social sharing, enquiring about our services or hiring our premises, competitions and activity for our partners. We will use the information provided by you only for providing you with an appropriate response.
In common with many other online services we also use “cookies” to collect information about how you use the Website. This information is used to produce statistical reports on website activity and allows us to tailor the Website to suit your interests. The information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. Examples include:
enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are delivered quickly to your web browser
When and how we share information with others
We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our services.
We may share your data within the group of organisations of which we are a part which includes Aldershot Town FC Academy and the Shots Foundation. We will only store or transfer your personal data within the UK.

If you wish to confirm that the Aldershot Town FC is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data we may have about you, please contact us at privacy@theshots.co.uk
You have a right to request correction of inaccurate information, deletion of information, and to instruct us to stop processing your information. We are obliged to honour such requests as per the regulatory requirements. If you’d like more information or would like to make such a request, please contact us at privacy@theshots.co.uk
Security of your information
To help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you provide to us, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees’ privacy responsibilities.
