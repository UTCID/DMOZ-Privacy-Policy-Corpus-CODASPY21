Information Collection
Information
You Provide to Us. We only collect certain information from you
when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register; (2) place an
order; (3) complete a survey or product review; (4) participate in one of
our promotions; (5) sign up for a Membership Program; or (6) contact us.
The information we collect from you may include your name, age, mailing
address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address,
account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a
third-party login (such as a social network) to register or otherwise link
to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party
based on your registration and privacy settings on that third-party
service.
Registration. We
encourage you to register when shopping on our Site or App; however,
registration is not required. Our Registration Form requires
users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address,
daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address, and
password). You must be 13 years of age or older to
register. Registration helps us to provide you with a quick and
simple checkout experience. The customer contact information you provide
will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your
questions and, unless you choose to opt-out, to send you communications
about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. You
acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your registration information and password. You are
responsible for all use of the Site or App under your registered account.
If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is
not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions
helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve your
shopping experience and to provide you with more relevant content and
advertising.
Information
We Automatically Collect. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel
tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain
information when you use our Site or App, or interact with our emails or
advertisements on our Site, our App, or other websites. A cookie is a
small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored
on your computer's hard drive. These technologies may allow us to
automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation
data, unique user ID, cell phone model, operating system and carrier, and
Internet Service Provider. We also may collect information about your use
of our Services, such as the time you spend using the Site or App, the
number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward
links, e-mails, and ads, and other Service usage data. These technologies,
such as cookies, also allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on
our Site or App, to recognize registered users when they visit, and to
provide those customers with information and advertising that is more
relevant to them. If you register with or order from us, we may use
cookies or other technologies to monitor and maintain information about
how you use our Services and what you buy. If you do not register with or
buy from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use in
order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more
relevant content and advertising.
Tracking
Options and California Do Not Track. You may adjust your browser
settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so,
you may not be able to use certain features on the Services or take full
advantage of our offerings. Even without a cookie, you can still take
advantage of most of the features of our Site, including making a
purchase, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user
unless you log in. Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or
headers from some or all browsers. We may use certain service providers to
provide you with more relevant online advertising based on your activities
on our Site and third-party sites. To learn more about, or to opt-out of, service
provider use of this information, please click
here. We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to
provide you with online advertising tailored to your interests. To opt-out
of our cookies used for this online advertising, please click
here. For certain service providers, such as social media platforms,
and on your mobile device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising
settings to limit your tracking for advertising or to control whether you
receive more relevant advertising.
Information
Collected From Other Sources. We may obtain information about you
from other sources, including social networks that you use to connect with
us. This information may include your name, user name, demographic
information, updated address or contact information, interests, and
publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity.
Combination
of Information. We may also combine the information we receive
from and about you, including the information you provide to us on the
Services or through the Membership Program, information we receive from
third parties, the information we automatically collect (as explained
above), and information provided or collected offline when you shop in our
Stores.

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily upload or submit for public posting to the Services becomes publicly available and others may collect and use that information. Posting any content on the Services that requests personally identifiable information from others violates the Services Terms of Use.
As with any business, as our business develops, we may sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that a third party acquires our company or substantially all of our assets, such information may be one of the transferred assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through the Services in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.
We may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about Site users with third parties.

Use of CookiesWe may use cookies and other technologies like them to make our Site better. You can read about how we use cookies and how you can limit or decline them in the Information Collection Section, specifically paragraph "3. Information We Automatically Collect" and paragraph "4. Tracking Options and California Do Not Track."
If we have actual knowledge that you are between the ages of 13 and 16, we will not automatically use cookies that send personal information to third parties unless you accept the terms in the consent banner we provide when you visit our website.
