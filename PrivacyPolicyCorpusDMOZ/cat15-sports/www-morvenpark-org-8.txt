Welcome to the bedroom of Marguerite Inman Davis!
Here's a sneak peek at Marguerite's dressing table and traveling "dressing kit" that normally sits closed on the floor. As you will see, Marguerite and her family were big fans of monograms!
Marguerite had a luxurious en-suite bathroom, dressing room, and a very impressive closet! While it's pretty empty today, we imagine Marguerite would have had this space filled!
