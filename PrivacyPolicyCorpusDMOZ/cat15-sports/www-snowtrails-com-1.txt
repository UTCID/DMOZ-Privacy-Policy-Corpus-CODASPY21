In the meantime, please reach-out here for assistance SnowTrails.com/ContactUsOur first snowmaking campaign of this pre-season saw marginal weather with high humidity and temps not dipping as low as desired each night, limiting production. Temps are forecasted to trend upward throughout the remainder of this week, with the possibility for snowmaking to return Sunday night, so we hope to get back to it then. Keeping the snow in stock-piles for now is important to shield the layers of snow beneath the surface to reduce the impact of warm temps and wind.Thank you for staying-up with us and please know although Opening Day will be delayed for now, we want nothing more than to get things going just as soon as possible for you.

PRIVACY POLICY & Terms of UsePRIVACY POLICYSnow Trails is very concerned for your sense of privacy and security while on our site as well as with respect to how we care for your information. The following is our privacy pledge to you and deals with the following issues:SECURITYThe importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information the Snow Trails site can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Snow Trails operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection. Snow Trails has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. The security measures we use include a firewall, encryption, and short web page expiration times.The firewall is a combination of hardware and software that securely separates the Internet from our organization's internal web servers. They are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our web servers.Encryption is used whenever financial information, customer identification and passwords are transmitted between Snow Trails and financial institutions. We use an encryption tool called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It scrambles your information into an unreadable format called cyphertext, so that even if a third party were to intercept the message, the data would be unreadable. In addition, we use Verisign site certificates that provide a 128 bit SSL encryption for our e-commerce.In addition to the technically driven security measures, we also follow internal privacy procedures. In most cases our employees will see personal information only in aggregate. Employees see only those data they need to complete your sale. All credit card transactions are handled on separate secure servers. Only authorized employees have access to these servers and your personal information that resides on those servers.Remember to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.INFORMATION COLLECTIONIn a few areas on our Web site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, process your order correctly, and if necessary, follow up with you before or after your visit.
