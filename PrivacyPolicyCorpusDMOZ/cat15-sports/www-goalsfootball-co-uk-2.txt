App terms & conditions.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS APP
What's in these terms?
These terms tell you the rules for using this app (our site).
Who we are and how to contact us
Our site is operated by Goals Soccer Centres plc ("We"). We are registered in Scotland under company number SC202545 and have our registered office at Orbital House, Peel Park, East Kilbride, G74 5PR.
To contact us, please email info@goalsfootball.co.uk.
There are other terms that apply to you
These terms of use refer to the following additional terms, which also apply to your use of our site:
Our Privacy Policy, which sets out the terms on which we process any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us.
Our Cookie Policy, which sets out information about the cookies on our site.
We may make changes to these terms
We amend these terms from time to time. Every time you wish to use our site, please check these terms to ensure you understand the terms that apply at that time.
We may make changes to our site
We may update and change our site from time to time to reflect changes to our users' needs and our business priorities.
We may suspend or withdraw our site
Our site is made available free of charge.
We do not guarantee that our site, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of our site for business and operational reasons. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any suspension or withdrawal.
You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our site through your internet connection are aware of these terms of use and other applicable terms and conditions, and that they comply with them.
Bookings made on our site
All bookings made via our site are subject to these terms and conditions and our code of conduct for players.
Contract: Our acceptance of your booking will take place when your payment is processed, or, if earlier, when we e-mail you to accept it, at which point a contract is formed between you and us.
Reference number: We will endeavour to attach a reference number to each booking, however, we take no responsibility for reservations that have not received a booking reference. If you are unsure at any time in the reservation process as to whether your transaction has been completed, you should telephone the relevant club to check that the transaction has been completed and to obtain your booking reference number.
Price: The price of each booking will be as quoted on our site at the time the payment for your booking is processed. We shall not be liable for any technical mistake resulting in the display of an incorrect price.
Cancellation: We reserve our right to cancel your booking and any future bookings with us if we are refused authority for payment or reasonably believe that payment will be refused at any stage.
Payment: We use Sage Pay, a third party payment specialist who are compliant with payment card industry data security standards (PCI DSS).
Goals will not store your card details without your permission and once you have entered your card number into a payment page securely hosted by Sage Pay, all payment data is encrypted and sent to the banks for processing. Some card details can be stored for your convenience but cannot be accessed by Goals and will still require security checks in order to be reused. Through Sage Pay, we have also enabled 3D Secure (Verified by Visa and SecureCode by MasterCard). This is an additional check. This box will appear and ask you to enter a selection of characters from your password e.g. first, third and fifth character. So do not be alarmed if this additional check appears. Other payment methods used are PayPal Accounts and such other providers as we may use from time to time. Such payment methods can be set up with such providers independently. When taking bookings, Goals enter into a contract with the person booking the pitch only. Where players pay individually, Goals are collecting this on behalf of the individual pitch booker and do not enter into a contract with each individual player.
Prepaid booking: If you have used a credit/debit card, full payment will be deducted from your credit/debit card at the time of making your reservation via our site. Discounted booking offers made through online bookings cannot be cancelled and no refunds will be given. Please be aware that the credit or debit card used must be shown when arriving at Goals otherwise you will not be permitted to use the facilities. You may request payment from individual players even when pre paying for a discounted booking. The overpayment value can be used to pay for a future booking but cannot be refunded. Refunding individual players will be the responsibility of the individual responsible for the pitch booking.
Online reservations (pay on arrival): Your credit/debit card will not be charged. You may pay for your bookings by either cash or card when at our branches.
Cancellation: Your reservation on the site can be cancelled at no charge by calling the relevant branch at which the booking has been made provided it is cancelled by 10pm on the day before the booking. Cancelling your booking after this point, or failing to show up, will result in a charge for the booking to your credit/debit card. Where payments have been collected from individual players these will not be refunded, however provided the game is cancelled at least the day before, then the full amount will be available to use for a future booking. It will be the individual who booked the pitch who will be responsible for administering payments between individual players if required in such instances.
We may cancel or amend your booking at any time, in which case we will refund your booking payment, however we will not be liable for any costs, expenses or losses arising from such amendment or cancellation.
