Privacy Policies
data, your privacy, and uea(su)
Your information and the way we hold it and process it is really important to us as an organisation. On these pages we hope to make it clear how we will deal with data within every aspect of the SU and what you can do about your data.
We've broken it down into statements for the Public, for our Members and for our Staff. You can access the different notices in the menu on the left. Each statement will have its own page soon, but until we've got everything ready, the previous policies can be found here:
Privacy Policy (Members)
If you'd like to make a Subject Access Request about your data and information, you can do so using the form on the Subject Access Requests page on the left.
