COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
BeRecruited respects the valid intellectual property rights of others. We will respond to allegations of copyright infringement with respect to content or materials on our Services, including without limitation User Materials, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”).
The DMCA provides a process for copyright owners to give notification to online service providers concerning alleged copyright infringement. When BeRecruited receives a valid DMCA notification, we respond by removing (or disabling access to) the allegedly infringing content or materials. After removing such content or materials, BeRecruited will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content or materials so that a DMCA counter notification may be submitted. After receiving a valid counter notification, BeRecruited generally restores the allegedly infringing content or materials, unless we receive further notice from the copyright owner that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged copyright infringer from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.
If you are a copyright owner, or an agent of a copyright owner, and you believe that any content or materials on our Services, including without limitation User Materials, violate your copyright, you may submit a notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our DMCA agent with the following information in writing (please see 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3) for further detail): (i) your physical or electronic signature; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to permit BeRecruited to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit BeRecruited to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and, (vi) a statement under penalty of perjury that the information in the notification is accurate, and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the allegedly infringed copyright.
BeRecruited’s designated agent to receive notifications of claimed copyright infringement under the DMCA is:
BeRecruited, Inc.
Attn: DMCA Notice
1333 N Kingsbury St.
4th Floor
Chicago, IL 60642
Email: termsofuse@berecruited.com
For the purposes of clarification, only notices pursuant to the DMCA should be directed to BeRecruited’s DMCA agent. All other questions or concerns about our Services or the Terms and Conditions should be directed to BeRecruited as set forth at the end of the Terms and Conditions.
If you believe that your User Materials have been improperly removed because they are not infringing, because you have authorization from the actual copyright owner or the owner’s agent and/or because you have the right to use the User Materials under applicable law, you may send a written counter notification to BeRecruited’s DMCA agent with the following information (please see 17 U.S.C. §512(g)(3) for further detail): (i) your physical or electronic signature; (ii) identification of the User Materials that have been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location(s) at which the User Materials appeared before such User Materials were removed or disabled; (iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that such User Materials were removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; (iv) your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address; and, (v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located or, if your address is outside of the United States, to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and that you will accept service of process from the party that provided notification to BeRecruited of the alleged infringement.
If BeRecruited’s DMCA agent receives a valid counter notification pursuant to the DMCA, we may send a copy of such counter notification to the original complaining party and we may inform such party that we may replace the removed or disabled content in ten (10) business days. Unless BeRecruited’s DMCA agent receives further notice from the original complaining party that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing activity, we may replace or re-enable access to the allegedly infringing content or materials not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days after receipt of the valid counter notification.

APPLICABLE LAW
The Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed under the law of the State of Illinois, without regard to conflicts of laws rules. You agree that the courts of Illinois shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the parties for all disputes. Venue shall lie exclusively and only in the state and federal courts in Chicago, Illinois.
ARBITRATION
With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with our Services, the various services offered by BeRecruited, or these Terms and Conditions (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), BeRecruited and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution. If you and BeRecruited do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor BeRecruited will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Any arbitration necessary under this section will be held through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial rules of arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that BeRecruited may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Chicago, Illinois necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Terms and Conditions must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed.
LIABILITY FOR TECHNICAL DISRUPTIONS TO OUR SERVICES
If you cause a technical disruption of our Services or any aspect of its functionality you agree to be responsible for any and all loss, costs, liabilities or expenses BeRecruited may suffer and you agree to be liable for any attorneys’ fees and costs arising from and/or related to the same. The foregoing shall be without limitation of our other venders in law or equity.
INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to compensate, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BeRecruited, our officers, directors, employees, agents, business partners, affiliates, distributors, licensors and licensees for, from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages, costs, or demands, resulting from any claim, action, investigation, demand, or proceeding arising in connection with your use of our Services or any violation of the Terms and Conditions.
SEVERANCE
Each provision of the Terms and Conditions shall be construed separately and independently of each other and the invalidity of any one part shall not affect the validity of any other part.
NO WAIVER
The failure of BeRecruited to enforce any provisions of the Terms and Conditions or to respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its rights to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms and Conditions or to act with respect to similar breaches.
