Ticket Policy
On June 4, 2020, the NBA Board of Governors approved a competitive format to restart the 2019-20 season with 22 teams returning to play at a single site and a tentative start date of Friday, July 31. The Board’s approval is the first formal step among many required to resume the season. The NBA is working to finalize a comprehensive season restart plan with the National Basketball Players Association.
Under this restart plan, remaining 2019-20 Celtics home games that had been postponed since March 12 in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will not take place at TD Garden.

Fans who purchased and still hold single game tickets for an impacted 2019-20 Season game through Ticketmaster or Ticketmaster affiliates (including NBAtickets.com) will automatically receive a refund within 30 days. This applies to Verified Resale Tickets through Ticketmaster as well.
Fans who purchased single game tickets for an impacted 2019-20 Season game directly from the Celtics should contact us through our general sales line at sales@celtics.com to determine available account credit and/or ticket refund options.
