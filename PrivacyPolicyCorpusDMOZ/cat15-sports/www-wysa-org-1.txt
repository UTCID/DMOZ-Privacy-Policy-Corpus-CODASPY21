The Westfield Youth Soccer Association is the Recreational program of the Indiana Fire Juniors. Soccer participation starts at age 4 and continues through high school seniors. We also have an Adult Recreational Soccer program for grownups who want to keep a foot in the game.
All WYSA youth soccer games are coached by parent volunteers. We do have a paid Coaching Director who works with our coaches and provides guidance, game plans and other helpful information.
The WYSA youth program has two separate seasons. Our fall season usually begins in late August and continues through early October, with weeknight practices and weekend games. Our spring season begins in early April and continues through the end of May, with weeknight practices and games either on the weeknights or on weekend, depending on the Grand Park schedule. The cost is $130 for ages 4 to 7 (preschool - second grade) and $150 for ages 8 and up (third grade-high school.) Register early for a discount. All practices and games are held at the Grand Park Sports Campus.
