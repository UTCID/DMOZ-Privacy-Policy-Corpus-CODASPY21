Health Care
After discovering that you are soon going to be a mother, it is important to look for an ob-gyn to take care of you. At this point, it is normal for one to be confused whether to retain your old doctor or get a new one. This is especially true for the first time mothers who really do not know what to expect. While it might be essential to get a new doctor, it is advisable not wholly sever your contacts with the current doctor. This is because they have a better understanding of your medical history.
If you are in Phoenix seeking to find a phoenix obgyn, there are several factors that you may want to put into consideration. This will help in making a more informed choice to ensure a safe delivery of your child. Some of these factors include:
Insurance Plan
When looking for an ob-gyn, look for one who is covered by your insurance plan. This is because it might be too expensive for you to cater for the ob-gyn consultations, especially during pregnancy. Your insurance plan should cover those costs. You can request that the list of the covered doctors from your insurer. In the event that your preferred ob-gyn is missing from the list. You will need to find whether you have a Point of Service plan. This plan allows one to select a medical care provider who is outside your network. You may be however required to pay more.
Qualifications
Before anything else, you need to verify that you are dealing with a qualified professional. A qualified ob-gyn needs to be certified by American College of Obstetrician & Gynecologists (ACOG). This is a requirement for one to practice as an ob-gyn in any Hospitals. If this certification is missing, you should be greatly concerned.
Referrals
Referral is another great way one can land a good ob-gyn. The good thing about referrals is that you are getting it from people who have had a firsthand experience with the doctor. This is a good way to start. After being referred to the doctor, book an appointment. From the conversation, you will be able to judge what kind of a relationship you expect to have with the doctor.
Instincts
Lastly, you will need to consider how you feel towards the list of doctors you have to choose from. It is also good to consider whom you like working with best. For instance, some women like working with male doctors while others prefer female ones. Your preference will directly affect the relationship that the two of you are likely to have.
These are some of the points that may help you make an informed decision on whom to make your ob-gyn. While they might not yield the perfect results, they will get at least better the choice that you are to make. The most important thing to keep in mind is that how you feel about the doctor is what counts. You should be comfortable with your ob-gyn as reproductive health is quite a sensitive subject.
