Privacy Policy
What information do we collect?
When you sign in, we collect your name, email address, and profile
image if you have one configured in your Google account.
When you register for the league, we ask for some information such
as your age and prior ultimate experience so that captains can make
informed drafting decisions.
We also collect server access and error logs for the purpose of
development and debugging.
How do we use the information?
When you register, we add your email address to an announcements
list that receives a few emails per year, for example: announcing
signups are open, or letting people know when games are rained out.
You can unsubscribe from this list at any time using the link at
the bottom of the email.
For the draft, captains receive a spreadsheet listing all the
players registered for the league, along with the drafting
information they supplied during registration. We ask captains to
keep this information confidential.
Your name and team history, along with a few items from your
registration (height, sex, attendance forecasting) are publicly
viewable on your player page. Your profile photo also becomes
visible for signed-in users.
After the draft, captains receive a list of email addresses for
their team members, so that they can communicate with their team.
As a consequence, it is likely that your email address will become
known to your teammates.
What information do we share?
We don't use your information for marketing purposes without
express permission.
