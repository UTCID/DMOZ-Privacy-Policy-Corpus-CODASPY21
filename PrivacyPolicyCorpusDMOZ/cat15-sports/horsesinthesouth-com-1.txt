HorsesintheSouth.com is constantly in development by staff and sub-contractors of Synergy, Et Cetera Web Design of Keystone Heights, FL. We can be contacted at 678-401-4608 (sales & marketing) or mktg@horsesinthesouth.com.
Please know that we are primarily a news aggregator so we put blog posts online from press releases from our media partners/press agents. We publish their contact information within the post, so please contact them if you have questions. We may not have their competition information nor do we have personal contact information for people listed in these articles. Possibly the press agents will have that information, so please contact them instead of us. Contact the people that are listed in press releases for equine protection services, too, as our only involvement is putting on the post/press release for them.
