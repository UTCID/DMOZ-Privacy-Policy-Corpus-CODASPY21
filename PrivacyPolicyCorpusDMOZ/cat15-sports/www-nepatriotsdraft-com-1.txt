Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting NE Patriots Draft.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We may collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit
our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Mozilla
Firefox, Internet Explorer) , your I.P. Address, and the address of the
website you were referred from.
We may also request that you participate occasionally in an anonymous
survey, requesting just your sex, age, household income, and other
information which is used to put together demographics for our
advertisers. The survey will not be able to personally identify you, and
simply helps us work with advertisers to design a campaign that will
fit the needs of those who visit this site.
There may be other occasions where you can submit information about
other people. For example, you might submit a friend’s name and e-mail
address to send a story, or invite them to our site. We collect this
information but only in the event we need to step in to prevent abuse or
other misuse of that e-mail tool (e.g. someone e-mailing that story 300
times to one person).
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
The non-personal information we collect is used to monitor traffic
and also allows us to improve our site to better fit the needs of the
fans who use it.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS
Some of our pages will contain links to products to affiliate sites,
or direct links to the site itself, and their information practices may
be different than ours. By virtue of these relationships, the third
parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors
voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Visitors should
consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over the
information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
Google, as a third party vendor and one of our advertising mediums,
uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google’s use of the DART cookie
enables it to serve ads based on your visit here to and other sites on
the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by
visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. We use
third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
website. These companies may use information (not including your name,
address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this
and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services of interest to you. If you would like more information about
this practice and to know your choices about not having this information
used by these companies, click here.
LEGAL NOTES
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to
legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement
agency’s request.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against
unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that
personally identifiable information that we collect will never be
disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
