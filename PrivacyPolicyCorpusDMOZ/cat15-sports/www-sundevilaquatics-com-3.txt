Cactus Aquatics is a competitive swim team where meet competition is very important. Failure to swim the meet schedule can lead to removal from the team. Training space is also very limited so appropriate practice attendance for each group is expected to maintain a swimmers spot on the team. If you have questions about what is expected in terms of attendance and meet participation for your child's group please talk with Mike Chasson and/or your swimmers coach.
