Code 1: marshaling
The club subsidises each member each year and this is paid for by the races and events we organise. With this in mind, each active club member is required throughout the year to volunteer at AT LEAST one of our events. Plus in order to have enough volunteers for our big race the Four Villages Half Marathon, any club member entering it must help out either before the race or supply a stand in volunteer on race day.

Code 2: London Marathon places
Each year Helsby Running Club gets allocated some London Marathon places (currently 1). Club members who have entered the London Marathon but are unsuccessful in securing a place through the general ballot can be entered into the draw for these places. Those wishing to be entered into this draw must supply their rejection slips plus there is a further requirement that they must have competed in at least two Border League races in the previous 12 months before the draw (usually held in November).

Code 3: social media policy
Helsby Running Club social network sites (including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, etc) should never be used as a medium by which to abuse or criticise club members, other clubs or organisations or other individuals and to do so would be in breach of the British Athletics Codes of Conduct and therefore subject to disciplinary action. See:
England Athletic Social Media Guidance Helsby Running Club – Feb 2017
Helsby Running Club social network sites are to be used as a forum for members and to promote its activities to the wider community. They are set as a closed groups. The nominated administers will only accept members of the club and/or people known by the club and in the running community as members of the group. All members must be aware that pages are visible to all users and should not contain information about young people, vulnerable people or bad language.

Code 4: club runs
Helsby Running Club’s policy is that on club
runs no one gets left behind. We achieve this by everyone in the group taking
responsibility for keeping the group together. Whilst there may be some taking
on the roles of leader and tail runner, this does not replace the need for
everyone in the group to make sure that the group sticks together. When we have
under 18s in the group, one of the adult runners must take on responsibility as
the buddy for that runner at the start of the run. Typically to keep a group
together, the group should agree at the start some “muster points”
where the faster runners either a) turn and run back to the slower runners
(preferred) or b) wait for the slower runners (less preferred). This can be
applied on all terrain.
Our groups of runners are courteous and respectful of others (eg other people
on the path, pavement and road). This may mean slowing down when passing
walkers, running in single file, thanking those who move out of the way, etc.
Our
runners look after their own and others’ safety. This typically means wearing
high viz when visibility is poor, using head torches as appropriate, taking
care when running along or crossing roads, etc
