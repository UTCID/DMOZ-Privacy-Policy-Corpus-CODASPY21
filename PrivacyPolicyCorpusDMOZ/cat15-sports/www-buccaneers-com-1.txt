WiFi Terms and Acceptable Use Policy
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (including Buccaneers Team LLC and Buccaneers Stadium LLC) ("Buccaneers", "we" or "us") are pleased to offer complimentary wireless networking access (the "WiFi Service") to guests and fans at Raymond James Stadium ("Stadium"). All WiFi Service users (referred to as "you") are governed by the following WiFi Terms and Acceptable Use Policy (the "Terms"). Your use of the WiFi Service represents your agreement to these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the WiFi Service.
Access to WiFi Service
The WiFi Service is complimentary and is offered entirely at the discretion of the Buccaneers. The WiFi Service will provide you with access to the internet via high-speed access points provided at the Stadium. This access is provided via a WiFi network utilizing the 802.11 standard. To access the WiFi Service, you must have a device that is compatible with the specific WiFi equipment available at the Stadium.  You are permitted to use the WiFi Service only for your own lawful purposes. You may not in any way distribute, resell, or otherwise provide third parties with access to or use of the WiFi Service.
Security Warning
The insecure nature and ease of connection to public WiFi network hotspots increases the risk that unauthorized parties can access your phone, tablet, laptop, or other device over the WiFi Service network. By using the WiFi Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that there are significant security, privacy, and confidentiality risks inherent in accessing or transmitting information through the internet, in particular through wireless technology. Your use of the WiFi Service is at your sole risk. You are solely responsible for implementing your own security protections while using the WiFi Service, for the security of your connected device and its contents, and for keeping all of your usernames, passwords, and other security-based information secure and private. We highly discourage you from conducting confidential transactions (such as online banking, credit card transactions, etc.) over the WiFi Service. You agree to hold Buccaneers harmless for the loss of any file, data, or other information, for any computer viruses or other corruption to your device, for any other damage or detrimental effects to your device, and for any unauthorized access to or utilization by any third party of any of your personal, financial, or other sensitive files or information, related in any way to your use of the WiFi Service.
Disclaimer
Your use of the WiFi Service is AS IS and AS AVAILABLE and the Buccaneers cannot and does not make any general or specific warranties regarding the security, availability, performance, or other functionality of the WiFi Service. BUCCANEERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND RELATED TO THE WIFI SERVICE, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. BUCCANEERS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE WIFI SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE, OR CONCERNING THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF THE SERVICE. BUCCANEERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE WIFI SERVICE. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Buccaneers or its representatives or through or from the WiFi Service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
Modifications to the WiFi Service / Updates to the Terms
Buccaneers reserves the right to modify, discontinue, temporarily or permanently, at any time, the WiFi Service and these Terms with or without notice. If you do not agree, or do not comply, with any modified Terms, you may not use the WiFi Service. Any changes to these Terms will be posted to www.Buccaneers.com/WiFi or at such other website as the Buccaneers may designate, and you should check that page periodically for updates. Your use of the WiFi Service constitutes your binding acceptance to these Terms as they may be modified.
Technical Requirements/Performance Limitations
The WiFi Service is subject to the availability and the operational limitations of the requisite equipment and associated facilities. Your device must be in close enough proximity to the WiFi Service access points to achieve connectivity with the WiFi Service network. You understand and agree that temporary interruptions of the WiFi Service may occur and that Buccaneers will not be liable for such interruptions. The WiFi Service may be subject to external interference, environmental influences, and other factors beyond Buccaneers' reasonable control, such as network traffic and congestion; performance, configuration, functionality of your device and/or wireless cards; physical obstructions and distance between your device and the WiFi Service network; availability of electric power; collocation failures; transmission and equipment limitations; network failures; scheduled and unscheduled maintenance/repair; and user error. Buccaneers is not responsible for data lost or misdirected, or any other damages or losses, due to these or other foreseeable or unforeseeable factors. Network speed is an estimate and is not an accurate indication of the speed at which your device or the WiFi Service will operate. Actual network speed and other performance will vary. There is no guarantee of your bandwidth on the WiFi Service. The WiFi Service is not suitable for supporting any application that requires continuous, error-free network connectivity or uninterrupted data flow. Buccaneers may implement URL filtering or other content filtering services which block access to certain websites or content while at the Stadium, at its sole discretion. Buccaneers shall not have any responsibility for such content filtering and will not be liable to you or any other party for any acts, omissions, performance, or non-performance related to the content filtering.
Right to Monitor and Manage Network Usage

You may use the WiFi Service only as permitted by applicable federal, state, and local laws, and in a manner consistent with the rights of others. The WiFi Service shall not be used in a manner which would violate any law or infringe any copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity, privacy right, or any other right of any person or entity. The WiFi Service shall not be used for the purpose of accessing, transmitting, or storing material, which is considered obscene, libelous, or defamatory. Illegal acts may subject you to prosecution by local, state, federal, or international authorities. Buccaneers reserves the right to report to, and cooperate with, legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrongdoing.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buccaneers and its respective subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders, and licensors, and the other partners and employees of each, from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of content you submit, post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the WiFi Service network, your use of the WiFi Service, your violation of these Terms, your violation of any laws or rights of another party, or any use of your device whether or not such usage is authorized by you.

Enforcement
Buccaneers reserves the right to investigate violations of these Terms, including by gathering information from the user and the complaining party, if any, and examining material on Buccaneers' servers and network. If Buccaneers, in its sole discretion, determines that you have violated these Terms, Buccaneers may take any responsive action that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion without prior notification. Such actions include but are not limited to temporary suspension of access to the WiFi Service, reduction of WiFi Service resources, and termination of access to the WiFi Service. Buccaneers is not liable for any such responsive action and these actions are not exclusive. Buccaneers may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.
