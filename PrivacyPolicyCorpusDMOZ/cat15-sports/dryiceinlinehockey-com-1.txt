Dry Ice Inline Hockey ("Dry Ice Inline Hockey")
operates www.DryIceInlineHockey.com and may operate other websites. It
is Dry Ice Inline Hockey's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Dry Ice Inline Hockey collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Dry Ice Inline Hockey's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how Dry Ice Inline Hockey's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Dry Ice Inline Hockey may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Dry Ice Inline Hockey also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on www.DryIceInlineHockey.com
blogs/sites. Dry Ice Inline Hockey only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Dry Ice Inline Hockey's websites choose to interact
with Dry Ice Inline Hockey in ways that require Dry Ice Inline Hockey to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Dry Ice Inline Hockey gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at www.DryIceInlineHockey.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Dry Ice Inline Hockey are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, Dry Ice Inline Hockey collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
Dry Ice Inline Hockey. Dry Ice Inline Hockey does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Dry Ice Inline Hockey may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. Dry Ice Inline Hockey may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Dry Ice Inline Hockey does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Dry Ice Inline Hockey discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on Dry Ice Inline Hockey's behalf or to provide services available
at Dry Ice Inline Hockey's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using Dry Ice Inline Hockey's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. Dry Ice Inline Hockey will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Dry Ice Inline Hockey discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when Dry Ice Inline Hockey believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Dry Ice Inline Hockey, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an Dry Ice Inline Hockey website and have supplied your email address, Dry Ice Inline Hockey
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with Dry Ice Inline Hockey and our products. If you send us a request (for
example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Dry Ice Inline Hockey takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
