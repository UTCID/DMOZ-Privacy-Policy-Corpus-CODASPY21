2020 Events impacted by COVID-19With the event industry currently shut down around the world due to COVID-19, we would like to continue to organize incredible dragon boat events as soon as we are cleared to return to racing on the water. However, we cannot do this alone and are going to need the help and understanding of the community to keep moving forward as a small business, and as a service provider to all of you. Our goal is to make the transition as seamless as possible and we are excited that GWN will become an employee-owned business.We want to be fully transparent with you – our community of incredible teams. While actions were taken to minimize the regular ongoing expenses, the 2020 events had already largely been planned and paid for with registration fees going to items ranging from staffing to insurance, equipment repairs, and event supplies. GWN operates almost a year in advance to provide teams with the best possible experience at each event. All MLDB and client events in Canada and the US through September are cancelled based on decisions made by government officials and health guidelines.  Adhering to the same guidelines, some of our fall events may still happen, with protective measures in place.We want to provide your team with as much value as possible. As such, we will provide teams registered for 2020 events with up to 125% of the value of your 2020 registrations. Teams registered for 2020 events impacted by COVID-19 will receive the following:A credit of 50% of the value from your 2020 event registration(s) towards the same event in 2021A
credit equal to 75% of the value of your total 2020 event
registration(s) that can be used towards up to half of the entry fee of any MLDB events in 2021 or 2022Guaranteed 2020 pricing for the 2021 seasonBefore registering for your next event, please contact us at info@gwndragonboat.com to receive a credit code to be used during the online registration process. The
credits can be used when taking advantage of early-bird pricing, but
cannot be combined with MLDB multi-event discounts or other promotional
discounts. Credits are non-refundable and non-transferable.
