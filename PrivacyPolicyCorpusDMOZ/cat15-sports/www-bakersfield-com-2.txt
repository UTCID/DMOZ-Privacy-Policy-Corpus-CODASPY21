PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.Last Revised: July 1, 2019Contributing Content and Comments to the Web Site. Subject to these Terms and Conditions (including our Community Rules and Guidelines, below), users of the Web Site ("Users") may use the Web Site's interactive community areas to comment on articles and news stories, submit classified advertisements and otherwise participate subject to the Web Site's functionality ("User Submissions"). All Users ages 13 and over are encouraged to contribute information and pictures to the Web Site. If you are under 13, you are not allowed to contribute content or comments to the Web Site. We reserve the right to terminate any accounts that do not fit this description. We do not endorse, and are not responsible for, any statement, opinion or advice given or made in User Submissions. We may, in our sole discretion, monitor, pre-screen, refuse to post, or remove any User Submission, though we have no obligation to do so. You agree that you are solely responsible for all User Submissions you post on the Web Site. We may discontinue or remove any User communication forums at any time, in our sole discretion.Community Rules and Guidelines. We encourage conversation between Users, and require such conversation to be civil. You are responsible for the quality of the conversations in which you participate: to maintain intelligent discussions, be respectful and considerate. And of course, use common sense, because your mother, grandmother, kids or boss may read your postings to the Web Site.No Personal Attacks: Please do not engage in personal attacks (on authors, other Users, or any individual), persistent trolling or mindless abuse. Rather, focus on intelligently discussing topics by furthering the conversation and informing the participants with resourceful and constructive ideas. Repeated personal attacks may be cause for suspension and possible expulsion from the site.Don't exploit people: Our Web Site isn't the place for harassment, stalking, threats, intimidation, trolling, flame wars or exposing others' personal information. We reserve the right to ban repeat offenders temporarily or permanently.Hate Speech Will Not Be Tolerated: Racism, sexism, pornography, homophobia or other hate speech will not be tolerated and may be cause for immediate and permanent expulsion from the Web Site.Watch Your Language: Watch your language and respect other people's views, beliefs and emotions. We reserve the right to remove or edit any content that might be offensive or threatening.No Spam: Spam and advertising content will be removed. Yes, this means you: Spam is spam, even if it is for a worthy cause.No Copyright Infringement: We like people who post original content. Otherwise, if you don't own the copyright to content you wish to post, be aware of other people's rights, or we may have to remove such content.Keep It Relevant: Please keep conversations relevant. Off-topic comments are subject to removal in order to keep the thread on track.Quality Check: We encourage you to take responsibility for the quality of the conversations in which you're participating:Maintain intelligent discussions by being respectful and considerate.Foster a discussion by sharing your point of view. Don't try to "win" an argument with sarcasm or insults: if you believe a particular article or a comment is silly, stupid or ignorant, make your comment by sharing why you think that is the case, and without using such terms. Be aware that sarcasm is often misinterpreted as an insult.Be aware of the number of comments you are posting: while we do not impose limits on the number of posts by any one person, remember a robust discussion often includes numerous contributors and perspectives. Discussions dominated by individuals become less interesting to the rest of the community, and discourage other User involvement.We reserve the sole right, in our discretion, to monitor, delete or choose not to post any given User Submission. This may include removing or monitoring posts that contain any of the above, that we believe violates the spirit or letter of these Terms of Use, or that we otherwise determine in our sole discretion needs to be monitored, not posted, or deleted.Help us: Maintain an inviting interaction space by self-policing threads and flagging violations and spam. Although we have a hands-on approach to community engagement, we do sometimes miss problem commentators or trolls. We appreciate your efforts to keep the community environment inviting, insightful and constructive. You can contact the community moderator at Webmaster@Bakersfield.com.Account Age Requirement. You understand and agree that the posting of User Submissions requires you to register for an account on the Web Site.
