Multi-Day Tour Skill Levels
Our tours range from moderate to intermediate to advanced in difficulty and the trail surfaces may be dirt road, 4wd routes and/or singletrack. Please make sure you are not choosing a tour that is too difficult for your skill level. Call our office if you have questions.
Moderate:
Suitable for riders with an average to good fitness level who engage in some form of regular exercise and are comfortable riding a bike for 2+ hours. Hills and descents are typically of short duration and longer steeper pitches can be easily walked. Trail surfaces will vary and change with occasional obstacles on trail (rocks, roots, sand) that can be either ridden or walked.
We strongly recommend training for your tour by getting on a bike as much as possible to get your butt used to the bike seat!
Intermediate: Suitable for riders with good to excellent fitness level. Previous mountain bike experience is recommended. Trail surfaces may include uneven terrain and narrow trails, singletrack, with occasional obstacles (roots, rocks, sand).
Hills and descents are moderate to strenuous and require some skill.
Riders with minimal mountain bike experience but who have road biking skills or a strong fitness level along with an adventurous spirit may be suitable for an intermediate tour.
Note: Challenging Intermediate Tours require more mountain biking experience due to consistently more challenging terrain.
Advanced: Suitable for experienced mountain bikers only with excellent fitness and strong bike handling skills.
Riding is primarily on rugged 4wd doubletrack with frequent obstacles or high elevation singletrack.
Sections of trail can be very challenging with frequent ascents and descents of significant length.
Most of our advanced level tours are located at elevations ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 feet where trail conditions can change rapidly due to weather conditions and thunderstorms.
Singletrack Tours:
Singletrack trails add an element of technical difficulty because of the narrowness of the trails.
If you are considering an intermediate or advanced singletrack trip, previous experience riding singletrack trails is essential.

Day Tour Skill Levels
Our tours range from EASY to MODERATE to INTERMEDIATE to ADVANCED in difficulty. We are happy to discuss what tours are a proper fit for your experience. Please make sure you choose a tour that is appropriate and safe for your ability and fitness level.
Easy:
Tours are suitable for beginner and above riders who are comfortable riding a bike, including children provided they can use hand brakes and are familiar with shifting gears. A moderate fitness level is essential to your enjoyment of this activity. Trail surfaces are typically wider dirt roads which may have occasional obstacles that can be avoided or walked through. Hills will be of short duration and can easily be walked both up or down.
Moderate: Tours are suitable for beginner and above riders with an average to good fitness level that engage in some form of regular exercise. Hills and descents are typically of short duration and longer steeper pitches can be easily walked. Trail surfaces will vary from bumpy dirt roads to 4WD and easy singletrack with occasional obstacles on trail (rocks, roots, sand) that can be either ridden or walked.
Intermediate: Tours are suitable for riders who have previous mountain bike experience and good to excellent fitness. Trail surfaces may include uneven terrain and narrow trails, singletrack, with obstacles (roots, rocks, sand) that range in size from curb to knee high, and occasionally larger. Hills and descents are moderate to strenuous and require some skill. Riders with some mountain bike experience who also have solid road biking skills or a strong fitness level, along with an adventurous spirit, might be suitable for a lower level intermediate tour.
Advanced: Tours are suitable for more seasoned mountain bikers with excellent fitness and very strong bike handling skills. Riding is primarily on rough doubletrack and singletrack with frequent obstacles that are typically larger than knee high. Sections of trail can be very challenging with frequent ascents and descents.
Singletrack Tours: Singletrack trails add an element of technical difficulty because of the narrowness of the trails. If you are considering an intermediate or advanced singletrack tour, previous experience riding singletrack trails is essential.

Updated June 25, 2020:
To All Rim Tours’ guests and potential guests:
Moab and most of Utah have relaxed restrictions in phases since the shutdown of Moab and most of the state. Likewise, the areas we travel to for our summer multi-day tours have also imposed fewer restrictions than before so our operations are back up and running in all areas. With our re-opening we have new protocols in place to keep both you and our staff as safe as possible and we are working with our guests individually to make sure your expectations and ours are met. Part of this is having each guest review and sign a Participation Contract (for Day Tours and for Multi-day Tours) in addition to a waiver for your tour. We also have a Covid Mitigation Procedures document to explain our Multi-Day Tour protocols.
We are running our Day Tours throughout the summer in Moab, leaving town early to beat the heat and our Multi-Day Tours are gradually ramping up after so many of you had to cancel. We are working with families and groups to create private experiences and pairing smaller groups together to meet our minimums for running a trip.
We truly appreciate our dedicated guests and staff for sticking with us and helping us survive the loss of over half of our season. Thank you!
Be safe, be well and ride your bike!
Kirstin, Matt and the Rim Tours Staff
