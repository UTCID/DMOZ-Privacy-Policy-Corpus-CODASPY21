Technical data about your access to and use of the website and app.
This is likely to include IP address (from which we may infer your country of location), the type of device you are using, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the device you use to access our website or app and information about whether you open our communications, which content you have viewed and other page interaction information.
This is primarily to help us better understand how our fans use our digital platforms to enable us to create better content and more relevant communications.  For more information on this, please see our Cookies Policy.
As part of the Champions Trophy Experience within the Official App, 'Champions Presented by Standard Charted’ we use Truedepth API to access the Front facing camera on iOS devices. The only use of this information is to provide valuable user features. None of the information collected by the TrueDepth API ever leaves the user's device. We do not share information around the TrueDepth API with third parties and we do not store or process in any other way the data which we access and use via TrueDepth API. As part of this feature in the Official LFC App a user can opt to use the function to place stickers on their face and can opt to save photographs of themselves. LFC do not store any of this face data within the App or on a server.
Information relating to any access, disability and/or dietary requirements you may have.
We will generally only request this information where it is needed for ticketing or hospitality purposes, for example where you have bought a ticket to an event so that we can make sure there are suitable accessibility arrangements in place.
Information required by law.
This may include, for example, where we need parental consent to provide online services to children under 13 (however, most of our websites are not designed for children under 13) or in response to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation.
Copies of identity documents where you are a season ticket holder (in which case we may collect details including your place of birth and residential address) which may include a photograph.
Where you are a season ticket holder, we may take copies of your identity documents in order to verify your identity.
We will only keep copies of your identity documents for as long as it takes us to verify your identity and will then securely delete those copies.
We use software that analyses the copies of identity documents that you provide to us which may automatically make a decision about your identity. However, where an automatic decision of this kind is made, you will always have the opportunity to challenge it if you disagree with the decision made.
We will not use the copies we take of your identity documents for any other purpose.
We may take a photograph of you to confirm your identity during the Season Ticket Amnesty process. This will be deleted once the amnesty has been completed and will not be stored by LFC for longer than this.
Please note that we may use any of the data described above to prevent, investigate and/or report fraud, terrorism, misrepresentation, security incidents or crime (including but not limited to ticketing offences), in accordance with applicable law.

Our use of data analytics
We evaluate, categorise and profile personal data to help us tailor materials, services and communications on our platforms and on third party platforms such as social media. This also helps prevent unwanted communications from filling up your inbox. This also helps us understand and provide a better experience to our fans, improve and protect our organisation and carry out research connected to our aims.
Internal research and analysis: We carry out research and analysis on our supporters, members and volunteers, to determine the success of campaigns and appeals, better understand behaviour and responses and identify patterns and trends. This helps inform our approach and make LFC a stronger and more effective organisation. Understanding our fans, their interests and what they care about also helps us provide a better experience.
Analysis and grouping: We analyse the data we collect about fans to identify common characteristics and preferences. We do this by assessing various types of information including behaviour, for example, previous activity or demographic information, such as age or location. This allows us to ensure you receive the communications, products and information which are most important to you.
Profiling to help us understand our fans: We profile fans on the basis of various criteria including their interests, general geographic location, website/app activity and socioeconomic and age groups. We also use aggregated, anonymised lifestyle data obtained from third parties to supplement our profiles. This information helps us to ensure communications are relevant and timely and to offer new products and services that may be of interest to our fans.
Several of these analytics activities rely on the use of cookies. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.  If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website or platforms may become inaccessible or not function properly.  For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookies Policy.

Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you or with your explicit consent, we can provide details of this to you on request. We will advise you at the time whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data).
If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), you may request that we provide with you information about what those legitimate interests are by contacting us using the details at 'How do I get in touch with you?' below.
____________________________________________________________________________________
Who will we share this data with, where and when?
Data will also be shared with third party service providers, who will process it on behalf of LFC for the purposes identified above.  Such third parties include providers of social media platforms and search engines, providers of services to the club such as website hosting, app developers, software providers, maintenance providers, payment providers, identity verification providers, video streaming companies, mailing companies and marketing services,
Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for the purposes above, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws.
We will only share your data with a third party for the purpose of them directly marketing to you where you have consented to such data sharing (for example, when entering into a specific competition for which we have partnered with that third party).
We may need to store or transfer your personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Further details of these safeguards can be provided for your review on request by contracting our Data Protection Officer using the contact information set out under the heading ‘How do I get in touch with you or your data protection officer?’ below.
In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.

What rights do I have?
You have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing).
Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests.  You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time. You can do this by following the instructions in the communication where this is an electronic message, or by contacting us using the details set out below:
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.
To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us or our data protection officer using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred. This likely to be the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK.

How long will you retain my data?
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
