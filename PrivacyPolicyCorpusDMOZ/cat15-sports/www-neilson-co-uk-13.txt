Where are my tickets?You don't need tickets to travel anymore, just your passport, but it's a good idea to take a copy of your travel documents with you. If you booked directly with us, your travel documents are available on My Neilson. It's a secure site that allows you to keep track of your booking, download your travel documents and make payments. If you booked through a travel agent, they will send your travel documents out to you, either by email or post. LuggageTake a look at our flight extras page.

In a nutshell, this is information from your passport that is required by the country you are travelling to before you get there. It can also help speed up the check-in process at the airport. How do I enter my passenger information?It’s easy to add passenger information to your booking. Simply log in to your My Neilson account, go to the passenger information (API) section on the left hand side and fill in your details. Please complete your details by 12pm two days before you fly. Don't worry if you don't enter them before you travel, you can also give your details at check-in.  For guests on British Airways flights, completing your passenger information in advance means you'll be able to use the self-service kiosks to check-in at the airport rather than having to queue for the limited amount of check-in desks. EasyJet also require you to complete passenger information (API) at www.easyjet.com. Follow the link and simply click on 'Check in', then input your surname and EasyJet booking reference which begins with an 'E' (shown on your travel documents 6 weeks before departure). If you're unable to submit on EasyJet's website in advance, this can be done at check-in via an automated passport scanner. If you booked your Neilson holiday through a travel agent, you will need to give your information at check-in.Can I pre-book flight seats?Take a look at our flight extras page.

Any child under the age of two is able to travel on the lap of an adult. If you decide you would like to pay for an additional seat then please contact us to check availability. Will I be able to keep my toddler's pushchair until we board the plane?Yes, you will be able to keep your pushchair until you come to board the aircraft. Can I bring my own car seat for use on transfers?It is usual for infants (0 to 23 months) to travel on their parents lap on our transfer coaches. We do not provide car seats for infants or children on our transfer coaches. If you are planning to bring your own car seat, it must be compatible with a 2-point lap belt. Please note that a 3-point child seat will not be compatible with the 2-point lap belts on our coaches.
Children aged 2 to 14 years are allocated their own seat on the transfer coach and should wear the lap or seat belt provided. Passengers over the age of 14 are also advised to wear the lap or seat belt. If you wish to use a 3-point car seat or have an infant in a rear-facing car seat, you should book and pay for a private taxi transfer. Child pricesThe price for children aged 14 years and under on the return date of the holiday will usually be at a reduction from the adult holiday price. The reduction will vary by destination and departure date, however it will generally be higher if the child is sharing a room with two or more adult priced passengers. As with all our holiday prices, please check Neilson.co.uk, call us or ask your travel agent for up to minute child prices.Contact us0333 014 3351For Sales, availability and queries on existing bookingsMonday to Friday:  9am - 5:30pm
