DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INFORMAL RESOLUTION AND FORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and the Devils agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to use of the Devils' Websites or applications (referred to as a "Claim") will be resolved as follows:A. INFORMAL RESOLUTION: You and the Devils will first attempt to resolve any Claim informally. In the event that any dispute between the Devils and you arises out of or relates to these Terms of Use, the applicability of these Terms of Use to the use of any Devils Website or applications, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms of Use, you and we agree to try to promptly resolve any such dispute informally. Please send a written notice describing the dispute to: New Jersey Devils c/o New Jersey Devils LLC, Attn: General Counsel, 25 Lafayette Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102.B. FORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER: READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION. You agree that any dispute, controversy or Claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, the applicability of these Terms of Use as to the use of any Devil, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms of Use, or the determination of the scope or applicability of Arbitration shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act.If you and the Devils cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either party will be resolved only by binding Arbitration. By agreeing to Arbitration, both you and the Devils understand and agree that all disputes shall be decided by an arbitrator and that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. Instead of suing in court, both you and the Devils each agree to settle disputes (except certain small claims) only by Arbitration. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The rules in Arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms of Use as a court would. The Devils and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, the Devils and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. The Devils and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.The Arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA. If you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator with significant experience resolving the type of Claim at issue. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.You may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate Arbitration, the Devils shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in connection with the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the Devils is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on the Devils and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Devils and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Devils and you agree not to seek any attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose.If your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.The Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and the Devils both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration. To initiate Arbitration, you or the Devils must do the following things:(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered and a copy of this agreement to arbitrate. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.(2) Submit a Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to the AAA by mail, facsimile, email, or on-line:To file by mail send the initial filing documents and the filing fee to:AAA Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043. To file via fax send the initial filing documents and a completed charge card authorization form for the filing fee to 877-304-8457. To file by email send the filing documents and a check or a completed charge card authorization form for the filing fee to CaseFiling@adr.org. Charge card authorization forms are available at www.adr.org/Services/Forms. To file on-line via AAA WebFile, visit www.adr.org and click on File & Manage a Case and follow directions to register.(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor the Devils shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER. Accordingly, you and the Devils agree that the AAA Rules for Class Arbitrations do not apply to our Arbitration. A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations.Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms of Use, you may choose to pursue your individual claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over the Devils and you otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. 13.) CLASS ACTION WAIVERPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.The Devils and you agree that the Devils and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims brought under these Terms of Use in connection with the Website will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. The Devils and you further agree that the Devils and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with the Website.If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in Essex County, New Jersey.The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any parent or affiliated company of the Devils to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Website, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Website. 14.) LIMITED TIME TO FILE CLAIMS: You agree that you will assert any Claim arising out of your use of any Devils Website or application within one (1) year after the Claim arises, or such Claim will be barred.SEE SECTION 17 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 14. 15.) GENERAL PROVISIONS: Those who choose to access this Website do so at their own risk and on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws. The Devils does not represent that the Website and the services and Content provided therein are appropriate or available for access and use in countries outside the United States. If you choose to access and use the Website from outside the United States, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable foreign laws. These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Subject to the Arbitration provision set forth in Section 12, you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in Essex County, New Jersey. If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
