The "Access" in Backcountry Access means a lot more than just getting after it in the mountains. Since 1994, our avalanche safety gear has been designed to make backcountry riding and snow safety more accessible: more widely available, affordable and easy-to-use. The "A" in access also stands for access for all backcountry users, no matter what the means of travel. Our discretionary spending goes into promoting avalanche education, not restricting access to the backcountry. Great products, great value, and a balanced perspective: that's how BCA has become the most trusted name in backcountry safety.

Alpine winter sports as we know them today were still very much in their infancy some 50 years ago. Sports journalist and ski instructor Hannes Marker, concerned by injuries suffered by his eager students and other inexperienced skiers on the slopes of the Bavarian Alps, resolved to lessen the sport’s inherent risks. And in so doing, he founded the company MARKER. Marker determined that inadequately responsive skiing equipment represented the single biggest cause of injuries. His perfectionist, problem-solving approach and commitment to arduous work paid off.
