5. WA Cricket Foundation
The WACF does not have a separate legal structure from the WACA. It is a project that is part of the WACA and has been approved and established by the WACA Board. It was set up to assist in fundraising for the programs and initiatives mentioned above. It is managed by a select committee of seven outstanding members of the community and has its own coordinator. It manages all private and corporate donations collected by the WACA, including those made directly to the WACA as well as those received indirectly by way of grants from the ASF.
To facilitate fundraising, the WACA has registered the WACF as a project with the ASF. The ASF is a deductible gift recipient established by the Australian Government to raise funds through public and corporate donations for the development of sport in Australia. For more information about the ASF, or to see their privacy policy or a copy of their terms and conditions for making donations, visit asf.org.au
If you wish to leave a gift to the WACA through the ASF, you should name the ASF as the beneficiary but nominate the WACF as your preferred recipient of the gift. By doing so, the ASF Board will take into account your wishes when they exercise their discretion to allocate grants. While you cannot leave a binding direction with the ASF when making a gift, by expressing your intention to benefit the WACF you can ensure that your gift has every chance of being allocated to the WACF as a registered project and in turn paid to the WACA.
All bequests can be made by naming the Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc.) (WACA) as a beneficiary under your Will.
