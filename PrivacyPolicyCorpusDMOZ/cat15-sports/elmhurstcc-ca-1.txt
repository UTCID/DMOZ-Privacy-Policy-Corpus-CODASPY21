This privacy statement has been prepared to affirm Elmhurst’s commitment to maintaining the privacy of its members and others and to inform you of its practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of information provided to it.
The commitment and obligation to maintain privacy applies to the Board of Governors, employees, contractors and agents who provide services to or on behalf of Elmhurst in connection with its provision of information and services to its members and guests.
Elmhurst collects information, about its members through a Membership Application form and does so to fulfill the objectives of the Club. Elmhurst collects members’ names, family relationships, birth dates, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. Elmhurst may also collect employment and credit information in order to verify creditworthiness and to secure payment of accounts. The achievement of Elmhurst’s objectives involve, among other things:
– maintaining a record of shareholders;
– communicating with members by mail and/or by e-mail to provide account and membership information, newsletters, surveys, election ballots, notices of meetings and information about Club events;

Elmhurst also collects personal information necessary for promoting, managing and conducting tournaments, weddings and banquets at Elmhurst. Contact information, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers is obtained by telephone or by the applicant(s) filling out a Confirmation form. The information is used to communicate with the individual(s) for the purposes of organizing their event. If it is a recurring event, the information will be used to contact the individual(s) to book future events. If it is a non-recurring event, the information will be retained for auditing purposes.
In order to fulfill the objectives of Elmhurst it is required to disclose personal information to others. Parties to whom personal information is disclosed include:

Personal information may include all information on the Membership Application form or the Confirmation form for event organizers. In such circumstances where, in the opinion of Elmhurst, it is appropriate or necessary to disclose personal information, Elmhurst will not disclose more information than is required.
