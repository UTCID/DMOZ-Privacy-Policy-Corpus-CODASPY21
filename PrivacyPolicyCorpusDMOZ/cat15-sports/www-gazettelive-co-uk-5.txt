Ayala left Boro after seven years at the club earlier this summer, and he has since signed a three-year deal at Blackburn Rovers.
The 29-year-old defender made his last appearance for Middlesbrough on New Years Day in the 2-0 win over Preston North End.
An ankle injury then ended his season, and ultimately his time at the club, although Jonathan Woodgate had been pushing to get Ayala back in action before his contract expired on June 30. That would have at least meant he was available for games against Swansea City and Stoke City during project restart, even if he hadn't agreed to an extension to stay on for the final six games after that. But Ayala returned still complaining about his ankle, and with a number of factors leading to a breakdown in relationship between the club and player, the Spaniard was told to stay away from Rockliffe before his deal officially ended.
Ayala insists he had wanted to return and play-on to help Boro. He told Lancashire Live: "It was quite tough, I wanted to play until my contract ran out, that's the way I am. I signed a contract and I wanted to honour the contract and play until June 30. "I came back from lockdown and my ankle still didn't feel right. That's why I decided, I tried to still play but I think Middlesbrough had other ideas and they didn't want me to be there anymore." Despite not playing a part in the run-in, he was thrilled Boro survived. "I was very happy [Boro stayed up]. I was there for seven years and I still feel as a Middlesbrough supporter so I wanted them to do well," he said. After a couple of months of uncertainty, Ayala has finally found a new club, joining former Boro boss Mowbray at Blackburn.

It was Mogga who initially tried to sign Ayala at Boro back in 2013 [on loan], though he'd been replaced by Aitor Karanka by the time the defender arrived. "I remember he was talking for about a month he wanted me to sign for Middlesbrough," Ayala said. "At the end when I joined he had already left but Mark Venus [now assistant manager at Blackburn] was the caretaker so I had him for three games which was really good.
"It's been a crazy year, especially after leaving Middlesbrough after seven years.
"It's never easy but I thought it was a decision I had to make. I needed a change, I wanted a new challenge and that's why I came to Blackburn.
"2020 - with my injuries and the coronavirus, it's definitely been a strange year. I got injured on January 1 and I haven't played since. I can't wait to get going." TeessideGazetteFollow @GazetteBoroMore OnTony MowbrayMiddlesbrough FCBlackburn Rovers FCDaniel Ayala
