GoDucks.net's Privacy
Commitment - Overview
GoDucks.net is committed

want to provide a safe, secure user experience.
We will use our best efforts to ensure that

herein.
The Following Reflects
Our Commitment To You
This notice applies to
all information collected or submitted on
the GoDucks.net website.
Information About All
GoDucks.net Visitors
In general, we gather
information about all of our users collectively,
such as what areas users visit most frequently
and what services users access the most. We
only use such data anonymously and in the
aggregate. This information helps us determine
what is most beneficial for our users, and
how we can continually create a better overall
experience for you. We may share this information
with our partners, but only in the aggregate,
so that they too may understand how GoDucks.net
visitors use our site, so they may create
a better overall experience for you, as well.
Feedback
GoDucks.net has an area
on the site where you can submit feedback.
Any feedback that is submitted through this
area becomes the property of GoDucks.net.
We may use this feedback, such as success
stories, for marketing purposes, on our message
board, or to contact you for further feedback
on the site.
Children
We do not specifically
collect information about children. We believe
that children should get their parents' consent
before giving out personal information. If
you are concerned about your child's use of
GoDucks.net, we encourage you to use Web filtering
technology to supervise your child's access
to the site. We also encourage you to participate
in your child's experience with GoDucks.net.
Privacy Commitment
Changes
If we decide to change
our privacy commitment for GoDucks.net, we
will post those changes here so that you will
always know what information we gather, how
we might use that information, and whether
we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any
time, you have questions or concerns about
GoDucks.net's privacy commitment, please feel
free to email us at privacy@goducks.net.
Thank you for using GoDucks.net.
We'll keep working hard to earn your loyalty.
