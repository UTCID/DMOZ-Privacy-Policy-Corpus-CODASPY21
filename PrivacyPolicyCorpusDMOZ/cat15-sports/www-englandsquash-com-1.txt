ENGLAND SQUASH PRIVACY POLICYLast update: April 2020This policy sets out how England Squash Limited (registered number 02411107 whose registered office is at National Squash Centre, Rowsley Street, Manchester M11 3FF) (“England Squash”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects and uses any personal data we collect or receive about you, why we collect and use your personal data, who we might share this information with and your rights in relation to your personal data.
We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy complying with our obligations under the general data protection regulation (“GDPR”) and all other laws relevant to the handling of your personal data. We are the data controller for the purposes of GDPR (meaning that we are responsible for deciding how your personal data is used).
When we refer to “personal data”, we are referring to any information which can directly or indirectly identify you, as explained more fully below.
WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU (OR RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES)
Information that you provide to us – this may include any of the following types of personal data which you provide to us when you sign-up to be an England Squash member, when you enter a tournament, enquire about a coaching or referee course or otherwise when you communicate or interact directly with us:
Identity Data - first name, last name, gender, images of you, username or other user identifier, date of birth, nationality;
Contact Data – your phone numbers, email address and postal address;
Financial Data – bank or payment card details and details of any purchases you make through England Squash; and
Profile Data – you may provide feedback to England Squash through surveys or feedback forms and indicate your preferences to receiving marketing (from us or third parties).
Information that we collect about you – when you visit the England Squash website we automatically collect the following types of personal data, using cookies or other similar technologies:
Technical Data – this might include your IP address, account log-in information, browser information, location information, operating system and system configuration, network and software identification and device information; and
Usage Data – this includes information about how you use the England Squash website, such as click throughs, time spent on page, download errors.Please review our Cookies Policy for further information.
Information that we receive about you from others – we may receive information about you when you use our connected platforms (such as the Club Locker platform referred to below) or from other relevant third parties, including your squash club or your county (provided in each case that the collection, transfer to, and use by, England Squash is lawful). The information which we collect from these third parties may include any or all of the above types of information. If we receive information from third parties we may combine this with information that we currently hold about you and process such combined information for the purposes set out below.
In addition to the above, please note that we may use and share aggregated data (such as demographic data). This may have originally generated from your personal data but is not treated as personal data under GDPR (as it doesn’t individually identify you). On such basis, we can use this data for any purpose. If this aggregated data is ever combined with other data in such a way that you can be personally identified, we will only use that data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate. Please keep us informed of any changes to your personal information.
Special category data - sometimes we may ask you to provide the following types of personal data, which are seen as more sensitive and are therefore afforded greater protection under GDPR. Prior to collecting and using any such data, we will obtain explicit consent from you (unless we have another legal basis for collecting and using this information) and will only use this data for the following purposes (or such other purposes as are explained to you at the time of collection):
Ethnicity data - this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity within England Squash and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.
Disability data - this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity within England Squash and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.
Injuries and other medical data - this may be collected by us directly from you, your county or via your club e.g. through a tournament withdrawal form. It will be used to assist with tournament results and rankings information and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.
Anti-doping related data - if you are an elite player who is required to participate in doping control procedures undertaken by a doping control officer appointed by UK Sport or England Squash, the results of such procedures may be used in results management, including associated disciplinary hearings, appeals and adjudications.
Criminal records data - we are registered with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to assist it in ensuring that those who take up England Squash appointments do not pose a risk to the children in our care. We may therefore process criminal records data disclosed by the DBS. This will be processed in accordance with the DBS’s Code of Practice for Registered Persons.
