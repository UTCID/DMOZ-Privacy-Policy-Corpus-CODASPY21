From time to time, Bradninch Cricket Club may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Bradninch Cricket Club also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on bradninchcc.org.uk blogs/sites.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
