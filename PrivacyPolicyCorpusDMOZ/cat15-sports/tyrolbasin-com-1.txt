Privacy Policyadmin2018-12-29T13:25:00-06:00THE INTERNET, PRIVACY, TYROLBASIN.COM ONLINEThe Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don’t want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At TyrolBasin.com we strive to help our customers protect their privacy while using our services.TyrolBasin.com is very concerned for your sense of privacy and security while on our site as well as with respect to how we care for your information.LAST UPDATED: 12/29/18SecurityTyrolBasin.com is very concerned for your sense of privacy and security while on our site as well as with respect to how we care for your information. The following is our privacy pledge to you and deals with security:The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to the servers where our information resides. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information the TyrolBasin.com site can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. TyrolBasin.com operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection. TyrolBasin.com has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. The security measures we use include a firewall, encryption, and short web page expiration times.The firewall is a combination of hardware and software that securely separates the Internet from the web servers we use. They are designed to prevent unauthorized access to the wrong web servers.Encryption is used whenever financial information, customer identification and passwords are transmitted between TyrolBasin.com and financial institutions. We use an encryption tool called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). It scrambles your information into an unreadable format called cyphertext, so that even if a third party were to intercept the message, the data would be unreadable. In addition, we use secure site certificates that provide  SSL encryption for our e-commerce.In addition to the technically driven security measures, we also follow internal privacy procedures. In most cases, our employees will see personal information only in aggregate. Employees see only those data they need to complete your sale. All credit card transactions are handled on separate secure servers. Only authorized employees have access to these servers and your personal information that resides on those servers. Remember to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.Information CollectionTyrolBasin.com is very concerned for your sense of privacy and security while on our site as well as with respect to how we care for your information.
