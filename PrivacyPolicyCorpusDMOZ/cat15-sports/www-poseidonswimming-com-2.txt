Locker Room Policy
Woodlake Aquatic & Fitness Center (WL) has public locker room / restrooms.  The use of public restrooms is intended for parents, visitors, students and the general public. Such access means there are multiple groups utilizing the space simultaneously creating need for Poseidon Swimming athletes to be respectful of others privacy. Poseidon Swimming athletes must be diligent in monitoring the area to protect all Poseidon team mates from any inappropriate conduct. The purpose of this policy is to protect our athletes, coaches and parents. We respectfully request all Poseidon parents review this policy with your athletes. Safety First!
The Poseidon Swimming Board of Directors believes that constant monitoring inside of all locker rooms and changing areas could be the most effective way to prevent problems, but it believes more strongly that our swimmers have a track record of behaving well and that constant monitoring would make swimmers uncomfortable and may even place our staff or volunteers at risk for unwarranted suspicion.
PSDN Best Practice Locker Room Policy
No PSDN athlete may leave practice without permission from a coach. (See Policy Considerations below.)
No PSDN athlete should be in the locker room alone at any time unless absolutely necessary.
PSDN athletes should read and adhere to WL and Poseidon Swimming Locker Room policies.
PSDN athletes must be aware of the other patrons utilizing the locker room and report to the coach or WL staff member any concerning or in appropriate behavior.
PSDN athletes should shower and dress quickly avoiding time spent without cover in front of mirrors or in front of others.
Parents should not enter the locker room unless absolutely necessary and then with conditions. (See below for Policy Considerations.)
Character First -- PSDN athletes understand personal accountability and the expectation of being a Poseidon Swimming team member is always about maintaining a high level of personal character. The use of poor language, inappropriate discussions and general rough housing in the locker room is inacceptable. Please notify a coach to report any violations.
General Policy Considerations
Coaches make every effort to recognize when an athlete goes to the locker room or changing area during practice and, if they do not return in a timely fashion, we will check on the athlete’s whereabouts. A swimmer leaving the water for the locker room or changing area must ask the coach first. It is impossible to record these instances, but this request allows for a better awareness.
Parents should not enter the locker rooms unless it is truly necessary. In those instances, it should only be a same-sex parent entering from the hallway and entry should only be to the point where inquiry can be made as to the progress of the swimmer—typically a few feet inside the door. Please remain close to the door in order to respect swimmers’ privacy. An opposite-sex parent needs to ask another parent to check on his/her child. If this is not an option, then the parent should let the coach know about this in advance, allow the coach to announce him or herself and allow swimmers to gather things to maintain their privacy. Following this announcement and a brief period, the coach and opposite sex parent can enter the locker room but only for the limited, specific purpose (and time needed) for which they entered.
USE OF CELL PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE RECORDING DEVICES
Poseidon Swimming prohibits the use of mobile devices with recording capability in locker rooms.
Cell phones and other mobile devices with recording capabilities, including voice recording, still cameras and video cameras increase the risk for different forms of misconduct in locker rooms and changing areas. The USA Swimming Athlete Protection Policies prohibit the use of such devices in the locker room or other changing area:
305.3 Use of audio or visual recording devices, including a cell phone camera, is not allowed in changing areas, rest rooms or locker rooms.
This absolutely applies to cell phones even if the person is not using the photo, video or other recording device. Please understand that the actual use of a photo, video or other recording device can violate state law as well as Poseidon Swimming team policies and lead to serious consequences. Your child should be specifically advised that cell phones are not things that they require at practice although reality suggests this is impossible to inforce. Please insure that all swimmers are aware NOT to use any function on any mobile or recording device whatsoever while in a locker room and should remain in a bag or clothing pocket.
