3.
USE OF INFORMATION.
If you provide information for a
certain reason, we may use the information in connection with
the reason for which it was provided.  For example, if you
contact us by email, we may use the information you provide to
answer any questions or resolve any problems.  Also, if you
provide information about yourself, or have provided (or
otherwise permitted the Services to access) any third party
data, we will use your information and any such third party data
to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your
use of such services.
We may also use the information we collect through the
Services to help us in providing the Services and support
services, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for
information, receiving and sending communications, updating
marketing lists, analyzing data and research aimed at improving
the accuracy, effectiveness, usability or popularity of the
Services, to personalize the content and advertising that you
see on the Services and to understand how users interact with
and use the Services, to associate your activities, customize
content or tailor advertising across different devices and
browsers that you use to access the Services or the Site (for
example, computers, tablets, mobile devices, applications and
websites), to comply with state, local, federal or international
laws, to enforce our Terms of Service and this Policy, as
otherwise described in this Policy, or in assisting with other
tasks from time to time.  Please note that we may combine
information that we collect from you and about you (including
automatically-collected information) with information we obtain
about you from our affiliates and/or non-affiliated
third-parties, and use such combined information in accordance
with this Policy.
We may also use data collected through the Services to enable
you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, contests,
sweepstakes, and message boards.
We may also use data collected through the Services to send
communications relating to the Services, in accordance with
applicable laws.  For example, we may send periodic emails
to registered users of the Services relating to their recent
interactions with the Services, such as submitting competition
results.  Also, if you use any feature of the Services
permitting you to communicate with third-parties (such as to
refer a third party to the Services or to communicate with them
regarding results or competitions), either by submitting third
party data to the Services or otherwise permitting the Services
to automatically access third party data in your possession, you
acknowledge and agree that you have the authority of the
relevant third party for us to access and use the relevant third
party data and that you have notified these third-parties and
informed them how their information is collected and used by
CollegeSwimming to provide the Services.  We reserve the
right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in
any messages that are sent to them.  We may use third party
data to (i) contact such third party using the third party
data provided, and/or (ii) provide you with an editable
template message designed to facilitate the communication
between you and such third party through the Services.  In
addition to sending the foregoing communications, we may also
send reminders or related messages to you and to third parties
on your behalf from time to time where permitted by applicable
law.
If you access the Services through a mobile device, you agree
that we may communicate with you regarding the Services by SMS,
MMS, text messages, or other electronic means to your mobile
device.  In the event you change or deactivate your mobile
telephone number, you agree to promptly update your
CollegeSwimming account information to ensure that your messages
are not misdirected.  Please note that your wireless
service provider’s standard charges, data rates, and other fees
may apply where you access the Services through a mobile
device.  In addition, downloading, installing, or using
some of the Services on a mobile device may be prohibited or
restricted by your carrier, and not all the Services may work
with all carriers or devices.
4.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.
With your consent, we may share your
contact information with third party marketing partners. For
example, we may offer access to relevant services if you allow
your information to be shared with third parties so that they
can contact you by email, telephone, postal mail or other common
communication methods about their products or services.
We share your contact information with third party vendors who
help us with specialized services, including customer support,
email and text message deployment, business analytics,
marketing, suppression list management and data processing.
These third parties are allowed to use your contact information
to help us provide the Services and not for any other purpose.
Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom
CollegeSwimming may jointly offer a service or feature. You can
tell when you are accessing a service or feature offered by a
Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner’s name will be
featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information
about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded
Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to
both us and the Co-Branded Partner; or we may share your
information with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the
Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy may also apply to its use of
your information.
CollegeSwimming continues to expand its online presence in
order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences.
Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect
about you with any affiliate companies, so that we can provide
you with information about products and services that might
interest you.
We may share your information in connection with a substantial
business transaction, such as the sale of CollegeSwimming, a
merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
bankruptcy.
We may disclose your information when we have a reasonable and
good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce
the terms of use of the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding,
court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or
protect CollegeSwimming’s rights under applicable law, including
without limitation, CollegeSwimming’s intellectual property
rights. In this situation, we will use reasonable efforts to
provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the
extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
5.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION.
When transferring money to CollegeSwimming, you provide personal
information, credit, debit or bank account information, and an
address (“Financial Information”) through CollegeSwimming’s third
party payment processor.  This payment process is external to
CollegeSwimming.  By using the Services, you grant our third
party providers the right, power, and authority to act on your
behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial
information from the relevant financial institution according to
terms of our third party providers’ privacy policies.
6.
DATA RETENTION.
In accordance with and as permitted by applicable law and
regulations, we will retain your information as long as necessary
to serve you, to maintain your account for as long as your account
is active, or as otherwise needed to operate our business.
When you close your account, we may continue to communicate with
you about the Services, give you important updates that may affect
you, and let you know about products and services that may
interest you, unless you have opted out of receiving marketing
communications.  We may also continue to use some of your
information for business purposes and to improve our offerings or
in some cases to develop new ones.  We will retain and use
your information as required by applicable laws and regulations
and CollegeSwimming’s detection and prevention of fraud.
7.
INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS.
You are solely responsible for interactions with
other users of the Site and the Services that you contact or
that contact you. Please note that there are risks, including
without limitation, the risk of physical harm, that may arise
when dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting
under false pretenses. You should therefore use caution with
regard to the information you elect to share as part of your
profile or account or that you otherwise upload to the Site or
use in the Services. Only list the contact information that you
are comfortable disclosing to other users of the Site and the
Services.
Although CollegeSwimming requests that users maintain the
confidentiality of the personal information they receive through
the Site, CollegeSwimming cannot and does not guarantee that the
information you provide to other users through the Site will be
held in confidence or properly secured by each applicable user.
In addition, CollegeSwimming takes no responsibility and assumes
no liability for any information that any user posts, sends or
provides via the Site. You agree that CollegeSwimming is not
responsible or liable for the conduct of any other user.
8.
CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.
We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain e-mails.
We provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your
personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. If
you are a user of the Site or the Services and you no longer wish
to receive e-mail, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your
e-mail address or postal address shared with third parties, you
may opt-out of receiving e-mail, mail, or telephone calls from us
or having your e-mail address or postal address shared with third
parties. All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at privacy@swimcloud.com,
or writing us at CollegeSwimming.com, LLC, 415 North Tejon,

9.
NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
Where possible, the CollegeSwimming server automatically
recognizes each visitor’s IP address. We also collect information
about how visitors use the Site (for example, what pages are
viewed). This information allows us to improve the content of the
Site, the Services, and facilitate market research.
10. COOKIES, FLASH COOKIES,
AND WEB BEACONS.
When you interact with the Site or
use the Services, we try to make that experience simple and
meaningful. We may use cookies and similar technology for
various purposes; for example, to record session information,
such as items that users viewed, and to save certain information
about users of the Site and others who visit the Site, in order
to facilitate and enhance interaction with the Site and the
Services.
A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other
personally identifiable information; however, we may link the
information obtained through cookies to other personally
identifiable information to give us a better understanding of
your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful
experience to you on the Site and with the Services.  A
number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web
or application session and expire when you close your browser or
exit the application.  Other cookies are used to remember
you when you return to the Site or the Services and will last
longer.
We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect
information about your access and use of the Site.  For
example, we may use cookies or other technologies that:
(i) allow you to navigate and use all of the features
provided by the Site; (ii) customize elements of the layout
and/or content within the Site and remember that you have
visited us before; (iii) identify the number of unique
visitors we receive; (iv) allow us to provide you with a
customized experience; and (v) inform us how you use the
Site and the Services (including how long you spend on the Site
or using the Services) and where you have come to the Site from,
so that we can improve the Site and the Services and learn which
functions are most popular with users.  As we adopt
additional technologies, we may also gather additional
information through other methods.
Most web and mobile devices automatically accept cookies, but,
if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to
notify you each time a cookie is set.  You may consult the
“Help” section of your browser for more information.
Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not
have access to certain features or offerings of the Site or the
Services.
11.
OTHER WEBSITES; LINKS.
Certain websites of CollegeSwimming’s affiliates, promotional
partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third party websites
are accessible through the Site. These third party websites have
their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
COLLEGESWIMMING IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIONS OR PRIVACY
POLICIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES. YOU SHOULD CHECK THE APPLICABLE
PRIVACY POLICIES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES WHEN PROVIDING PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THROUGH LINKED WEBSITES
12.
THIRD-PARTIES.
In addition to the specific third-parties noted in this Policy,
CollegeSwimming may also contract with other third-parties to
provide various services to CollegeSwimming relating to the Site
on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.
By visiting the Site, all visitors consent to CollegeSwimming
providing both personal and non-personal information received from
those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of
enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced
services to CollegeSwimming. In addition, all visitors consent to
the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and
non-personal information by CollegeSwimming and these third party
providers.
13.
YOUR RIGHTS.
Some users (in particular, European Union users) have certain
legal rights to obtain information about whether we hold personal
information about them, to access personal information we hold
about them, and obtain its correction, update, amendment or
deletion in appropriate circumstances.  Some of these rights
may be subject to some exceptions or limitations.  We will
respond to your request to exercise these rights within a
reasonable time.  Rights to which you may be entitled
include:
Data access rights;
Right to restrict;
Right of Rectification;
Right to Erasure;
Right to object to processing;
Right to withdraw consent; and
Data portability rights.
14. CHILDREN.
The Site is not directed to children. For purposes of this Privacy
Policy, “children” means children under 13 years of age.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CollegeSwimming understands that the
Site may be accessed by children. We recognize the need to provide
further privacy protections with respect to personal information
that may be collected from children on the Site. For additional
information about our practices regarding children’s personal
information, please read the Children’s Privacy Policy at the end of
this Policy.
15.
SECURITY.
We will use commercially reasonable security measures on the Site
to protect the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration, or destruction of the information under
CollegeSwimming’s control. While there is no such thing as
“perfect security” on the Internet, we will take commercially
reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal
information.  In particular, email sent to or from the
Services or the Site may not be secure.  Therefore, you
should take special care in deciding what information you send to
us via email.  Please keep this in mind when disclosing any
information to us via the Internet.
16.
TRANSFER OF DATA INTERNATIONALLY.
CollegeSwimming is headquartered in the United States and has
affiliate offices and partners in other countries. Please be aware
that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result
of your use of the Site may be collected in your country and
subsequently transferred to the United States or another country
in accordance with applicable law. The privacy and data protection
laws in the country to which your information is transferred may
not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By
using the Site or providing us with your information, you consent
to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing
of your information.
17.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.
CollegeSwimming does not track its
users over time and across third party websites to provide
targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not
Track (DNT) signals.  However, some third party sites do
keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you
content, which enables them to tailor what they present to
you.  If you are visiting such sites, certain browsers
allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that
third-parties (particularly advertisers) know that you do not
want to be tracked.
Subject to certain limits under California law, California
residents may ask us to provide you with (i) a list of
certain categories of personal information that we have
disclosed to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes
during the immediately preceding calendar year; and
(ii) the identity of those third-parties.  To make
this request, California residents may contact us as specified
in Section 19.
If you are a California resident under 18 years old and a
registered user, you can request that we remove content or
information that you have posted to the Site or other
Services.  Note that fulfillment of the request may not
ensure complete or comprehensive removal (e.g., if the content
or information has been reposted by another user).  To
request removal of content or information, please contact us as
specified in Section 19.
18.
GENERAL.
This Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of the
State of Colorado, without regard to its conflict of laws
principles. Jurisdiction for any disputes, controversies, and
claims arising under, in connection with, or out of this Policy
shall lie exclusively with the state courts located in Colorado
Springs, Colorado, or the federal courts located in Denver,
Colorado. If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions of this Policy, which shall remain in full force and
effect. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL COLLEGESWIMMING HAVE ANY
LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT
OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS POLICY, HOWEVER OCCASIONED.

CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
CollegeSwimming is committed to protecting the privacy of
children who use our sites and applications. This Children’s
Online Privacy Policy explains our information collection,
disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to
information provided by children under the age of 13 (“child” or
“children”), and uses terms that are defined in our general
Privacy Policy. This policy is in accordance with the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). For more
information about COPPA and general tips about protecting
children’s online privacy, please visit OnGuard
Online.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM
CHILDREN, HOW WE USE IT, AND HOW AND WHEN WE COMMUNICATE WITH
PARENTS. CollegeSwimming offers to its users a range of
activities and services, some of which may collect information
from children. Below, we summarize potential instances of
collection and outline how and when we will provide parental
notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we
collect personal information from a child, we will retain that
information only so long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill
the activity request or allow the child to continue to
participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our
users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we
discover we have collected information from a child in a
manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will use
commercially reasonable efforts delete the information or
immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.
Registration. Children can, in many cases, register with
the Site and applications to view content, play games, log
information, provide results, input data, participate in
contests, and engage in special features, among other
things. During the registration process, we may ask the
child to provide certain information for notification and
security purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email
address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s
member or account username, and password. We also may ask
for birth dates from children to validate their ages. Please
note that children can choose whether to share their
information with us, but certain features may not function
without it. As a result, children may not be able to access
certain features if required information has not been
provided. We will not require a child to provide more
information than is reasonably necessary in order to
participate in an online activity.
Collection of parent email addresses: Consistent with
the requirements of COPPA, in any instance in which we ask
for age and determine the user is a child, we will ask for
a parent or guardian email address before we collect any
personal information from the child. If you believe your
child is participating in an activity that collects
personal information and you or another parent/guardian
have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking
your consent, please feel free to contact us at privacy
@swimcloud.com. We will not use parent emails provided for
parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless
the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or
has separately participated in an activity that allows for
such email contact.
Content Generated by a Child. Certain activities on
the Site and applications may allow children to create or
manipulate content and save it with CollegeSwimming. Some of
these activities do not require children to provide any
personal information and therefore may not result in notice
to the parent or require parental consent. If an activity
potentially allows a child to insert personal information in
their created content, we will either pre-screen the
submission to delete any personal information, or we will
seek verifiable parental consent by email for the
collection. Examples of created content that may include
personal information are stories or other open-text fields,
drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information,
or photo submissions. If, in addition to collecting content
that includes personal information, CollegeSwimming also
plans to post the content publicly or share it with a third
party for the third party’s own use, we will obtain a higher
level of parental consent.
About Verifiable Parental Consent:
Email Consent. In the event CollegeSwimming wishes to
collect personal information from a child, COPPA
requires that we first seek a parent or guardian’s
consent by email. In the email we will explain what
information we are collecting, how we plan to use it,
how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent
can revoke consent. If we do not receive parental
consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the
parent contact information and any other information
collected from the child in connection with that
activity.
High-Level Consent. In the event CollegeSwimming
collects personal information from a child that will be
posted publicly, we will seek a higher level of consent
than email consent. Such “high-level” methods of consent
may include, without limitation, asking for a credit
card or other payment method for verification (with a
nominal charge potentially involved), speaking to a
trained representative by telephone or video chat,
requiring a signed consent form by mail, email
attachment, or fax, or checking a form of
government-issued identification against databases of
such information, provided that the parent’s
identification shall be deleted promptly after such
verification is complete. After providing high-level
consent, a parent may have the opportunity to use a pin
or password in future communications as a way to confirm
the parent’s
CHAT. Certain activities may allow users to communicate
directly with other users by means of a chat system. We may
employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag
inappropriate communications to prevent the communication of
both personal information and age-inappropriate words and
phrases. We strongly encourage children who use these
interactive features never to provide personal information
about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to
attempt to circumvent our moderation. We recommend that
parents carefully supervise their children when the children
participate in online activities.
CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES. For contests and sweepstakes, we
typically require only the information necessary for a child
to participate, such as first name (to distinguish among
family members) and parent email address (to notify the
parent where required by law). We only contact the parent
for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment
purposes when the child wins the contest or sweepstakes. Of
course, some contests and sweepstakes ask the child to
submit their own created content along with the child’s
entry. In those instances, we may require parental consent
prior to submission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall
not condition a child’s participation in a contest or
sweepstakes, the offering of a prize, or another activity on
the child’s disclosing more personal information than is
reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.
EMAIL CONTACT WITH A CHILD. On occasion, in order to
respond to a question or request from a child,
CollegeSwimming may need to ask for the child’s online
contact information, such as an email address.
CollegeSwimming will delete this information immediately
after responding to the question or request. In connection
with certain activities or services, we may collect a
child’s online contact information, such as an email
address, in order to communicate with the child more than
once. In such instances, we will retain the child’s online
contact information to honor the request and for no other
purpose such as marketing. Whenever we collect a child’s
online contact information for ongoing communications, we
will simultaneously require a parent email address in order
to notify the parent about the collection and use of the
child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an
opportunity to prevent further contact with the child. On
some occasions, a child may be engaged in more than one
ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to
“opt-out” of each communication individually.
PERSISTENT IDENTIFIERS. When children interact with us,
certain information may automatically be collected, both to
make the Site and applications more interesting and useful
and for various purposes related to CollegeSwimming.
Examples include the type of computer operating system, the
child’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web
browser, the frequency with which the child visits various
parts of our Site or applications, and information regarding
the online or mobile service provider. This information is
collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies,
web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This information
may be collected by CollegeSwimming or by a third party.
This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in
order to:
provide users with access to
features and activities on our Site and applications
customize content and improve
our Site and applications
conduct research and analysis
to address the performance of our Site and applications
generate anonymous reporting
for use by CollegeSwimming
In the event we collect (or allow
others to collect) such information from children on the Site
and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and
obtain consent prior to such collection.
WHEN INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM
CHILDREN IS AVAILABLE TO OTHERS. In addition to those rare
instances where a child’s personal information is posted
publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we
also may share or disclose personal information collected from
children in a limited number of instances, including the
following:
We may share information with our service providers if
necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or
technology support function for us.
We may disclose personal
information if permitted or required by law, for example, in
response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal
information collected from children (a) in response to
a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or
children services) request; (b) if we believe
disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime,
facilitate an investigation related to public safety or
protect the safety of a child using our Site or
applications; (c) to protect the security or integrity
of our Site, applications, and other technology, as well as
the technology of our service providers; or (d) to
enable us to take precautions against liability.
PARENTAL RIGHT TO REVIEW PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILD. Upon
request of a parent whose child has provided personal
information, we will provide the following:
A description of the specific types or categories of
personal information collected from children by
CollegeSwimming, such as name, address, telephone number,
email address, hobbies, and extracurricular activities;
The opportunity at any time to refuse to permit our
further use or future online collection of personal
information from that child, and to direct us to delete the
child’s personal information; and
A means of reviewing any personal information collected
from the child.
Prior to disclosing any such
information, we shall use reasonable procedures to
(a) ensure that the requestor is a parent of that child,
and (b) not be unduly burdensome to the parent.
If a parent has refused to permit
CollegeSwimming’s further use or collection of personal
information from his or her child or has directed
CollegeSwimming to delete the child’s personal information, we
retain the right to terminate any services provided to such
child.
CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY AND
INTEGRITY. We have established and will maintain reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and
integrity of personal information collected from children. We
will also take reasonable steps to release children’s personal
information only to service providers and third parties who
are capable of maintaining the confidentiality, security and
integrity of such information, and who provide assurances that
they will maintain the information in such a manner.
PARENTAL CHOICES AND CONTROLS. At any time, parents can
refuse to permit us to collect further personal information
from their children, and can request that we delete from our
records the personal information we have collected from their
children. Inquiries may be directed to:

In any correspondence such as email
or mail, please include the child’s name and/or username on the
Site or application (if any) and the parent’s email address and
telephone number. To protect children’s privacy and security, we
will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s identity
before granting access to any personal information.
