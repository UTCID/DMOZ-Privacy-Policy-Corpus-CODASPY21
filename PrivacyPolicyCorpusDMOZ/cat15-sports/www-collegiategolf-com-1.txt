Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
The Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA) recognizes
the importance of protecting our users' privacy. To that end we have
created the privacy statement and spam policy in order to demonstrate
our commitment to privacy.
Information on how site content can and cannot be used is also listed below.
What Information is Collected
GCAA and its web hosting company, acting as GCAA's agent, collect and store
technical information about your visit to our website. We use this
information for statistical purposes to make our site more accessible to
visitors and the information we collect is not provided to any other
third party. Specifically, we may record:
The name of the domain from which you access the Internet.
The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, if any.
The type of web browsing software and operating system you are using to view our site.
The date and time you access our site.
The pages you visit on our site.
The amount of time spent on the site.
Some
parts of the GCAA website may use a "cookie," which is a file placed on
your computer hard drive, that allows the GCAA web server to log the
pages you use in the GCAA site and to determine if you have visited the
site before. The GCAA server uses this information to provide certain
features during your visit to the website. You can set your browser to
warn you when placement of a cookie is requested and decide whether or
not to accept it. By rejecting a cookie, some of the features available
on the site may not function properly. We do not use cookies to collect
personal information (email address, etc.)
Throughout the
website there may be forms to request information, products, and
services. These forms typically ask for contact information (such as
your phone, address or email address), financial information and demographic information (for example,
company product categories, areas of interest, location, etc.) Contact
information from these forms is used to send the products, promotional
materials or membership information that you request.
How Information Collected is Used
Demographic and profile data collected on our site may be added to a database maintained by GCAA.
Links to Other Sites
The website contains links to other websites. GCAA is not responsible for
the privacy practices of such websites. Inclusion of links to an outside
website, whether in an advertisement or content area of GCAA's website,
is not an endorsement of the website or a guarantee that the
information it contains is accurate.
Security
This site uses physical,
electronic and managerial procedures to protect information collected
online including firewalls to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of
the information under our control. The use of these security measures
is not a guarantee that information supplied over the Internet will not
be intercepted.
Convention
Exhibitors,
partnering organizations or sponsors may be provided with mailing
addresses of conference registrants before and after GCAA National
Convention.
Many exhibitors collect business cards or collect
attendee information at their booths during the convention. If you
supply this information to an exhibitor at a booth, the GCAA views this
as voluntarily providing information to the vendor. This is how many
vendors build their marketing lists. If you receive materials following
the GCAA National Convention via email or receive a phone call, please
be assured this information did NOT come from the GCAA, but possibly did
come from the information you provided to an exhibitor during the
convention.
Mailings
The GCAA may allow certain
sponsors, partners or vendors to do a limited number of mailings to our
members to inform you of their products and services.
Member Directory
Among
the most valuable benefits of GCAA membership is the ability to connect
with a colleague in our sport. For that reason the GCAA maintains
profile information and has a searchable, online directory of members.
This tool is accessible to current GCAA members only. Members and/or
vendors are prohibited from harvesting contact information from the GCAA
Member Directory.
Change in Terms of Privacy
GCAA reserves the right to alter its privacy policies. Any changes to the policy will be posted on this page.
This
site is controlled and operated by GCAA from its offices within the
United States. GCAA makes no representations that materials,
information, or content available on or through this site are
appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them
from territories where such materials, information, or content are
illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this site from other
locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance
with applicable local laws.
Site Content
You may
access, download and print materials on this website for your personal
and non-commercial use. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit,
display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works
from, transfer, or sell any information, software, products or services
obtained from this website without first obtaining written consent from GCAA. Furthermore, you may not use the materials found on this website
on any other websites or in a networked environment without first
obtaining written consent from GCAA.
All materials on this site
(as well as the organization and layout of the site) are owned and
copyrighted by the Golf Coaches Association of America. © Copyright Golf Coaches Association of America 2011. All rights reserved. No
reproduction, distribution, or transmission of the copyrighted materials
at this site is permitted without the written permission of the GCAA.
Spam Policy
All email and electronic communications with members should adhere to the following principles:
1.
You should have a prior relationship with the person receiving your
email. (Someone giving you their business card is acceptable in this
regard-it implies permission to get in contact. Similarly if someone has
sent you an email.) 2. A valid "from" and "reply to" address must be included with each message. 3. If you have a subscription list, you should send a confirmation email that the person wishes to be on the list. 4. There should always be a quick way to unsubscribe from any mail list. 5. Any request to cease mailing from an individual or organization should be quickly honored.
