Introduction
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information you submit to us.
This Privacy Policy sets out the measures taken by us, Glasgow 2014 Limited (or “Glasgow 2014”) to protect your privacy when you use our website at www.glasgow2014.com and any other domains, microsites or webpages maintained by or on behalf of us (in this Privacy Policy, we refer to these sites as “the Website”).
We describe below the way in which we collect and use your private information and personal data. In this Privacy Policy we refer to your private information and personal data as your “information”.
By using the Website (and submitting your information to us), you agree to our use of your information for the purposes described below. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or submit any of your information to us.
What information do we collect from you and how do we collect it?
When you visit the Website, our web servers automatically collect certain data that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website, such as your IP address and information relating to which pages have been viewed.
Please read the section headed Cookies below for information on how we use cookies to collect and use your information.
When you use the Website, we also collect information that you provide to us voluntarily, for example when you complete an online or offline registration form or user survey. The type of information we typically collect includes your name, email address, age and post code.
Sometimes in the course of using the Website, you may choose to upload or post content or information (for example photographs) on public areas of our Website that anyone can see. This sort of content or information is not considered as information that is subject to this Privacy Policy.
How do we use your information?
The ways in which we use your information depend on the type of information you provide and the purpose for which you provide it. This section sets out different ways we may use your information.
If you register for MY2014 email updates on the Website, we may use your information to send you online and / or email communications containing updates on Games progress and developments. If at registration you choose to be alerted about specific topics, we may use your information to send you online and / or email communications related to these topics.
We may provide your information to any third party that manages any facility, service or promotion via the Website on our behalf. This includes, for example, any website hosting company or ticketing agent.
If you use our “Email a Friend” function, the recipient will receive an email from the address which you entered in "Your email address" and a URL linking to http://www.glasgow2014.com. We will not retain the information you provide.
If you submit an online job application via the Website, we may use the information provided by you for the purpose of considering your application. If you are not successful in your application, we may ask you if you are happy for us to keep your information so that we can consider you for future job opportunities.
If you register at our procurement portal -https://businessopportunities.glasgow2014.com/ - we may use the information provided by you to contact you about Glasgow 2014 business opportunities and to manage the procurement process.
We may integrate your personal data from our various databases (for example where you register for different services or updates across our Website) to form a single view of you. This allows us to have an effective and efficient communication with you.
We may use your information to compile statistics to help us understand how people use the Website and to customise the Website’s content, lay-out and services. This will allow us to improve the experience on our Website.
We may transfer your information and store it at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for processing by staff operating outside the EEA who work for or are contracted by us, a contractor or another Commonwealth Games organisation. By providing your information to us, you agree to your information being transferred, stored and processed in this way.
We may transfer your information if there is a transfer of ownership of the Website or of Glasgow 2014.
Only where you have specifically consented for us to do so, we will pass your information onto certain third parties so that they can provide you with relevant information about their products and / or services or for other purposes to which you have consented.
Apart from the purposes described above, we shall only use the information that you provide to us for the purpose described at the point of collection or for purposes that are otherwise legally permitted.
When are we required to disclose your information?
As noted above, we shall only use the information that you have provided to us for certain defined purposes.
However, we may also disclose your information if we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law, regulation, court order or any competent governmental, statutory or public body or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of our partners, licensors or the public.
From time to time, we may also cooperate with a law enforcement agency in any official investigation, and we may disclose your information to that agency in doing so.
Data Protection
We shall collect, store and use your information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
Security of your information
Once we have received information from you, we shall endeavour to protect it by using physical, managerial and technical procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access to it.
We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information you provide to us in an email or in online form while it is being transmitted to us, because the internet is a potentially unsecure method of information. Any transfer of information from you to us is at your own risk.
Whenever you voluntarily post private information in public areas of the Website, you should be aware that such information can be accessed by the public and may in return be used by others to send you unsolicited communications. We recommend that you exercise discretion in deciding what information you post in public areas of the Website.
Accuracy of your information
We shall endeavour to keep your personal data accurate and up-to-date and for no longer than is necessary.
Your right to access your information held by us
The Data Protection Act 1998 gives individuals a right of access to their information held by an individual or organisation.
If you wish to access any of your information that we hold, you may make a request in writing using our Subject Access Request Form or by emailing or writing to our Data Protection Manager, whose contact details are set out below. Although the Data Protection Act only requires a request to be in writing (e.g. email, letter), it is helpful for both you and us if you complete the Subject Access Request Form. This allows us to know exactly what information you require without having to contact you to seek clarification, thereby speeding up the process.
Please note that a small fee of £10 is payable to contribute to the cost of looking for your information.
