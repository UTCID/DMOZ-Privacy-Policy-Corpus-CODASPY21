Fabulous trip – such beautiful scenery – these were some of the best horses we’ve ever ridden. Very sure-footed, alert, ready to go and still kind-hearted and gentle with their riders. We really appreciated the way you made us feel at home straight away. Thank you so much for a wonderful time.

We came for two days but stayed in two weeks! Thank you for opened your home for us, so we could share your daily life and see what’s going on, on a farm. We really appreciate your hospitality, the good food, the horse riding and your sense of humour! We love you!

A beautiful horse trek with Lawrie and Jenny. It was a great experience, so beautiful landscape, very quiet country and a nice camp. You can be sure the saddles are very good – no problem for your bottom.

I discovered a wonderful area. Now, I know the true Kiwi. The Kiwi is Lawrie – like John Wayne. I’ve never seen him before. Never I forget this horse trek. I would like to come back again.

I think it was a very nice trip. Before going, I haven’t expected such a good trip with so nice people. Moreover the landscape is very beautiful. Sometimes I have thought that I lost time when you work its very nice to get outside like that.
