Terms of Use
Last updated: August 2, 2006
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS.
These Terms of Use govern the access to and use of all services, features and content made available through or in connection with PlayHer Sports (“Organization,” “we,” “us”) websites and online facilities (collectively, the “Site”), including through password-protected portions of the Site (“Member Areas”). Use of the Site by visitors to the Site (“you”) is subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use, which supplement any additional guidelines or other terms posted by Organization in relation to specific Site-related services or content. Although you can access and read portions of the Site by visiting the Site, you must register as a member to use certain Site features – such as signing up for a program or making a payment. Please note that we reserve the right to update or modify these Terms of Use without advance notice by posting a revised Terms of Use to the Site. You can determine whether the Terms of Use has been modified since your last visit by viewing the “Last updated” legend posted at the top of the Agreement. By checking the “I agree to the above terms of use” box (if you are a Member) or by using the Site, as applicable, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, and agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy. If at any point you no longer agree to the Terms of Use, please arrange to cancel your membership of the Site by notifying Organization and discontinuing your use of the Site. Organization may deny service to you at any time, including in the event you do not adhere to these Terms of Use.
2. REGISTERING WITH THE SITE; ACCESS AND AUTHORITY TO USE MEMBER AREAS.
Registering with the Site. The Organization welcomes anyone to check out the Site, and to sign up to receive news about the Organization, offers and other information that may interest you from time to time. But in order to sign up a child for a sports program or to transact any business with Organization through the Site, you must register with the Site and create an account and password.
Account, Username and Password. If you register to become a Member of the Site, you will be asked to select a username and password. You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password and agree not to transfer your account to another party. If you become aware that your account is no longer secure, please notify us and change your password. You agree that you will (1) log out and close down access to Member Areas at the end of each Site session; and (2) immediately notify the Organization of your loss, or any unauthorized use of, your username and/or password or account, or any other breach of security. You have the option to change your password as often as you wish by creating a new password. It is recommended that you change your password at least once every 60 days.
You agree (a) to use your username, password and access to the Member Areas only to conduct business on behalf of you, your child or the organization you represent, as applicable; (b) to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete information about yourself; and (c) not to select a username that impersonates someone else or otherwise violates someone else’s rights.
Deactivation of Members. The Organization has the right to deactivate you as a Member at any time for any reason, including without limitation for the reason that (a) you are terminating your employment with your organization; (b) your Member account will be inactive for an extended period of time; or (c) there is reason to believe that you have violated or will violate these Terms of Use. Upon any deactivation of your account by Organization or your Administrator(s), your license to use the Site will automatically terminate and you agree that you will cease use of the Site immediately. Although Organization is not responsible for monitoring access to the Site, Organization reserves the right to deactivate any Member’s access to the Site at any time.
Administrator Responsibilities. Organization has designated or will designate at least one authorized employee, volunteer or independent contractor to serve as its administrator for purposes of overseeing access of Organization’s employees and other authorized representatives to the Site ("Administrator"). Administrator will have access to the complete range of features, services and information available through the Member Areas of the Site. Administrator will determine which features and services each Member may access by selecting and assigning an access level permission to each Member based on each such Member’s need and appropriateness to access specific Site features, services or information. Each Administrator is responsible for overseeing and monitoring access by its organization’s Members to Member Areas. If you are an Administrator, you must deactivate Member accounts when Members no longer require access to the Site for any reason. If you have reason to believe that a password is being misused by a Member or used by an unauthorized person, you must deactivate the account, and notify us at support@OasysSports.com. Administrator(s), and the respective organizations they represent, as applicable, are solely responsible for the conduct of the individuals they authorize to access the Site on behalf of their organization.
Primary Administrator; Changing or Adding Administrators. The person initially designated to act as Administrator on behalf of an organization ("Primary Administrator") has the authority to designate one or more additional Administrators for their organization, who will have the same privileges and responsibilities as the Primary Administrator and who can, in turn, designate additional Administrators. All Administrators are bound by these Terms of Use, including the provisions specifically applicable to Administrators.
