Website Use Information
Cookies. We may use â€œcookiesâ€ to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server and stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our website and what you look at and purchase. They may store your preferences, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password.

A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individualâ€™s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your personal information.
IP Address and Click-through Information
Our server collects data about your serverâ€™s Internet address automatically when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number thatâ€™s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever youâ€™re on the Internet. When you request pages from our website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.

We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with your personal information. Any or all of these activities with regard to website usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.
How BIGHORN Uses Your Personal Information:
BIGHORN will use your personal information, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.

In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like, such as our e-newsletters), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the right to opt in and opt out section above. We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. In general, other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share Personal Information with third parties.

Aggregate Statistics
We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our website and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

If you contact us by e-mail or a â€œcontact usâ€ or similar feature on our website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. Do not send sensitive information (such as payment card information, social security numbers, employer identification numbers, passwords, or pin numbers) to us via e-mail or via a â€œcontact usâ€ or similar feature on our website. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
