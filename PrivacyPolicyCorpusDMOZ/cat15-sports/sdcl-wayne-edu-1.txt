Coronavirus (COVID-19) Operations Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the university has made several temporary adjustments to normal operations. Changes in the Office of the Registrar are listed below. For information on Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 Pass/No Pass grading, go to: COVID Pandemic Pass/No Pass Grading for Undergraduates Updates on Course Material Fees (CMF) and Student Service Fees (SSF) are available here: Tuition and Fees Confused by changes in your schedule? Here's a guide on How to Read Your Class Schedule For an explanation of the meeting types on the Fall 2020 schedule, please visit the following link: Fall 2020 Meeting Type Updates Incomplete grades must normally be cleared within 12 months of being assigned. Students whose 12-month period expires during Winter 2020 term will be extended to the end of the Spring/Summer 2020 term. We are processing requests for duplicate and replacement diplomas. However, due to limited access to offices for printing and mailing, we ask for your patience. We are striving to complete orders within four weeks of receipt.  For updates regarding transcript availability, go to: Transcript Requests For information on Winter 2020 Pass/No Pass grading, go to: Pass/No Pass Grading The withdrawal deadline for Winter 2020 was extended to April 20, 2020. Finals week was still scheduled for Wednesday, April 22, through Tuesday, April 28. For face-to-face classes that moved online, exams also moved online.
