Privacy Policy
Please take some time to read and understand our
privacy policy.
The term “SailRiders” in this agreement refers to the SailRiders.com website, and “user” refers to you, the person who is using this service.
SailRiders does not request any personal information from visitors browsing the public sections of SailRiders. Personal identification information is only requested when using non-public services such as placing a waypoint. The requested personal information may include your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number.
While browsing the public sections of SailRiders, certain information may be collected for statistical and marketing purposes. This may include information such as your IP address, geographical location, pages visited, length of visit, browser type, and screen resolution. Cookies may also be used to provide an advanced browsing experience (i.e. remember preferences such as language, privacy, etc).
When adding a waypoint, the user is requested to provide private information such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number. This information is necessary to contact the user. E-mail addresses are never disclosed to the public.
SailRiders will not disclose this private information to any third parties, except when it is mandatory (i.e. some information is provided to PayPal to enable online payment, or information will be disclosed if requested by legal and law enforcement authorities). In some cases you have the option to be redirected from SailRiders to third party websites through hyperlinks. Visiting linked third party sites is entirely at your own risk, as third party websites are not under the control of SailRiders. We recommend that you read the privacy policies available at those sites before disclosing any personal information.
Information collected from users will only be used to better understand preferences and needs and make the browsing experience more personal. We may send news and information at the user’s request. Administrative communications related to registration are necessary to validate user information (such as e-mail address).
Please contact us if you have any additional questions.
