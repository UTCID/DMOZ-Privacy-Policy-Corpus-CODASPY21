I love coming here, it feels like a home / member course... everyone is friendly, pro shop,
starter, player assistants on the course and the drink cart team, especially Jen. The layout is fair, playable from many different tee decks, this track is always in immaculate condition.
Mike McReavy
Excellent course.
Very tough but fair.
Staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable.
I would definitely play again and reccomend to anyone.
Sean Rowland
Hard to find a more private course. Very friendly staff and great food. I wish I lived closer to this place.
Kevin Crompton
Reasonable green fees. Great course with some challenging holes. Mature trees along fairways provide some shade on the hot days. Excellent value. This is an under-rated golf course in my opinion.
