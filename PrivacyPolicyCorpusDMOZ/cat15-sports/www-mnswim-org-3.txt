Crisis Management/Disaster Recovery Plan The MNSI Crisis Management Plan manages the distribution of critical, often sensitive, information to the media, the public, and its members while the Disaster Recovery Plan is designed to insure business continuity by protecting the LSC from threats to its physical assets and IT-disabling disasters. See the plans here.
Zone Board of Review Effective January 1, 2015: Board of review inquiries from members of Minnesota Swimming, Inc. (MSI) can be directed to one of two boards: the Central Zone Board of Review or the National Board of Review.
To become more familiar about the areas of responsibility for each of the boards click here for more information.

(NOTE: The Bylaws of MSI do not establish an administrative review board at the LSC level. According to USA Swimming this is optional and must be established by amendment to the Bylaws adopted by the MSI House of Delegates.)
Amateur Sports Act of 1978 The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act of 1978, signed by President Jimmy Carter, establishes a United States Olympic Committee and provides for national governing bodies for each Olympic sport. The Act provides important legal protection for individual athletes.
The Act charters the U.S. Olympic Committee, which in turn can charter a national governing body (NGB) for each sport such as USA Swimming for competitive swimming. Each NGB in turn establishes the rules for selecting the United States Olympic Team and promotes amateur competition in that sport. The Act requires that active athletes (defined as amateur athletes who have represented the United States in international amateur competition within the last ten years) must hold 20 percent of the voting power of any board or committee in an NGB.
The Act also provides athletes with due process and appeal rights concerning eligibility disputes.
