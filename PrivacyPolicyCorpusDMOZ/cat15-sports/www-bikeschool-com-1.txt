United Bicycle Institute respects the privacy of all users who visit our site. No effort is made to identify individuals without their knowledge. The following policies are in effect for all of the Web pages owned and operated by United Bicycle Institute, Inc.
When a visitor views any of our pages, our server automatically recognizes the browser's domain name and IP address. Our server does not automatically record e-mail addresses. We collect the domain names and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. This information is collected solely for statistical purposes and is not used to identify individuals.
On all of our forms, such as our brochure request and registration forms, we ask users to provide their e-mail address or mailing address for the intended request of the form. United Bicycle Institute maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party if submitted to us. Whenever the identity of a visitor is recorded, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the request before the information is submitted. Your street address or e-mail address is never given to anyone else. Many of our forms give you the option of being placed on our e-mail list for future mass mailings announcing new developments or events at UBI. If you select that option, your e-mail address will only be used for that purpose. You may easily be removed from the list by contacting us with this request.
Currently, our site only has two areas that may send a "cookie" to your computer (if cookies are enabled in your browser). Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer. The web site that submits the cookie is the only one that may view it. You may receive a cookie if you sign up for the "My Links" feature on our links page and the information stored in the cookie is only used to enable the "My Links" feature to remember your chosen personal links. The other area of our web site that uses cookies is our online store. Its cookie will store your customer ID number, making it easier for you to make purchases in the future. In both cases, the cookie information is only used for the intended purpose and is not used for gathering statistical information about you.
If you post any notice in any of our online forums, your name or alias is recorded solely for the purpose of identifying each unique posting within the forums. No effort is made to identify individuals who participate in forums or to monitor their activity in any way.
This site uses a secure server and authentic Thawte Digital Certificate. Information submitted by you in secure mode is encrypted for your privacy. This means no other party may view your personal information while in transit over the Internet.
United Bicycle Institute reserves the right to change our online policy at any time. Changes will be duly noted on this page.
