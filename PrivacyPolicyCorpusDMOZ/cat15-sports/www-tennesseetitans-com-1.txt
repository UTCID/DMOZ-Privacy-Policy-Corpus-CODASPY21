Nissan Stadium Clear Bag Policy | Tennessee Titans - TennesseeTitans.com
Nissan Stadium Security Guidelines
Welcome to Nissan Stadium
As an organization, our goal is to create a first-class experience for our fans on event days, and ensuring the safety and security of our guests is top priority.
With that in mind, Nissan Stadium has applied for certification and protection under the SAFETY Act with the Department of Homeland Security.
So how does this affect ticket holders for stadium events? There will be updates to the existing NFL clear bag policy and strict enforcement of all carry-in policies as we move forward. Please familiarize yourself with the rules and best practices below before visiting Nissan Stadium.

Clear Bag Policy
The Titans strongly encourage fans not to bring any type of bag to Nissan Stadium to expedite entry at the gates, but if you need to bring personal items to the game, please familiarize yourself with the NFL's clear bag policy.
To provide a safer environment for the public and speed fan entry, the Tennessee Titans enforce a league-wide NFL policy that limits the size and type of bags that may be brought in to the stadium.
Clear bags must be 12" x 12" x 6" or smaller.
Non-transparent bags can be no larger than 4.5" x 6.5," even if you are placing it inside your larger clear bag. Please Note: Non-transparent bags are still subject to inspection by security personnel at the gates.
Clear bags are available at the Titans Locker Room next to Gate 1 and online at TitansLockerRoom.com.
All styles of clear bags are acceptable as long as they are 12" x 12" x 6" or smaller. This includes clear cinch sacks, clear diaper bags, gallon ziploc bags, etc. Guests will not be allowed to empty and collapse a non-approved bag into a clear bag.
The clear bag policy is in effect for all Titans games, college football games, concerts and any other sporting event at Nissan Stadium.
PROHIBITED ITEMS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
• any non-transparent bag larger than 4.5" x 6.5"
• coolers or containers, including glass bottles, cans (aerosol and non-aerosol), thermos, hard plastic tumbler
• metal flasks, metal cigar/cigarette cases
• seat cushions, folding and/or standalone chairs
• umbrellas
• strollers or baby seats
• camera lenses over 6", video cameras/recording devices, tripods
• poles, selfie sticks, sticks of any kind
• drones, unmanned aircraft
• horns, whistles or other noisemakers
• weapons of any kind (including pocket knives)
• outside food/beverages
• illegal drugs or substances, any alcoholic beverage
• animals, except service animals assisting guests with disabilities
• footballs, inflatable balls, balloons
• any headwear or apparel with hazardous attachments including, but not limited to, spikes and blades
• lights (flashlights, LED lights, any battery-operated lights)
• anything that creates a nuisance or disruption
For the protection of our fans, prohibited items cannot be stored by Nissan Stadium personnel. All unattended items including, but not limited to, backpacks, bicycles, strollers and umbrellas will be disposed.
During concerts and other non-sporting events, additions may be made to the prohibited items list, at the discretion of the artist and/or management. All updates will be communicated via the Nissan Stadium social media channels.
Magnetometers
Nissan Stadium has magnetometers located at all points of entry. Fans entering the magnetometers are asked to place clear bags and non-transparent bags smaller than 4.5" x 6.5" on the security screening table for examination. All loose items, such as keys, phones and wallets, can remain in your pockets and no longer need to be removed for screening.
Please keep your PPE on as you walk through the magnetometer.
Please note, if you have headwear, you will be asked by security personnel to remove it prior to walking through the magnetometer. No protruding or sharp metal objects may be attached to your headwear. Nissan Stadium reserves the right to refuse altered helmets or other headwear.
Storage Lockers Available
Lockers for oversized bags and prohibited items not allowed in to the stadium are available for rent at these locations:
-- Corner of 2nd & Victory (by Lot T)
-- Corner of 1st & Russell (by Lot F)
Price of rental starts at $10.
No prohibited items will be accepted at the stadium gates for safekeeping.
Please do not discard or hide prohibited items outside of the stadium gates and in the perimeter landscaping. All unattended items will be confiscated.
Child Care Products
BRINGING KIDS TO THE GAME?
Reminder: Any child two and older needs a ticket for entry. Children under the age of two may be seated in your lap.
THE FOLLOWING CHILD CARE PRODUCTS ARE PERMITTED AT ALL GATES:
- Clear diaper bags only
- Clear plastic bottles/sippy cups containing liquid for the child (children under two)
- Baby food, snacks and formula in plastic containers for children under two (no glass)
- Wipes (Place in clear ziploc bag to expedite inspection and gate entry | Original packaging is permissible; however, it will need to be opened for a detailed inspection)
- Baby carrier/harness
PLEASE NOTE: Breast pumps and other electronic/battery operated child care devices must be screened at the gate in the designated Medical lane. Medically designated lanes can be found at all Nissan Stadium gates, marked with a red Medical sign (this is typically the right-most lane at every gate).
STROLLERS ARE NOT PERMITTED AT ANY NISSAN STADIUM GATES.
This policy is in effect for all major events at Nissan Stadium, including football games, concerts and other sporting events.
Water and Sunscreen
You may bring an empty, soft plastic, disposable water bottle through the gate. For your convenience, water fountains are located on all Nissan Stadium concourses.
If needed, you may request a cup of ice at any concessions stand. There is no charge for ice. Please Note: Empty cups are not permitted for stadium entry.
Sunscreen, in a non-aerosol container, is permissible at all gates. (No larger than 8 oz.)
Forget yours? Sunscreen is available for purchase at the Titans Locker Room next to Gate 1 on gameday. It is also available at all First Aid stations, if needed.
Medical Entrances
All Nissan Stadium gates have designated Medical lanes. Medical equipment and supplies (including liquid containers and coolers) will be thoroughly screened by security personnel at all gates. When feasible, medical equipment and supplies should also be placed in a clear bag to expedite inspection. Medically designated lanes are marked with a red Medical sign (this is typically the right-most lane at every gate).
Banners and Signs
Signs no larger than standard poster board (28" x 22") are allowed in the stadium; however, they may not be affixed to any part of the stadium (railing, wall, etc.). Signs may not block the view of other patrons. Banners deemed objectionable will be removed and confiscated. Banners or flags on sticks or poles are strictly prohibited.
During concerts and other non-sporting events, permissible signage guidelines are subject to change based on artist and/or management discretion. All updates will be communicated via the Nissan Stadium social media channels.
Tablets
Small tablets, such as a standard iPad (with screen size 10" or less), are permissible for stadium entry. These devices may be used in your seat as long as they do not interfere with any other fan's enjoyment of the game. We reserve the right to ask any fan to discontinue the use of such devices.
Blankets and Coats
COLD WEATHER TIPS:
For cold and inclimate weather, make sure you're prepared. Blankets, jackets and coats are permissible; however, do not place them in your clear bag for inspection. Either wear or carry these items as you approach the gate.
If you have gloves, headwear or a mask, you will be asked by security personnel to remove it and carry it through the magnetometer.
As you approach the gate, hand warmers should be placed in your clear bag or in the bowl on the security screening table next to the magnetometer.
Frequently Asked Questions
Why did the NFL and its clubs adopt this policy?
The league and clubs review their public safety and stadium security policies every year looking for ways to improve them. The Committee on Stadium Security and Fan Conduct leads this review and obtains a wide range of information to assist in doing so. The committee strongly believed that it made sense to adjust our policy to enhance public safety and make stadium access more efficient by limiting the size and style of bags carried into the stadium. This was reviewed with the clubs at the May league meeting and will be implemented by every team.
This proactive measure both will enhance safety inside and outside the stadium and speed the security screening process for all NFL fans. The public deserves to be in a safe, secure environment. This is about both safety and improving the overall fan experience.
How does the new policy improve public safety?
As an organization, our goal is to create a first-class experience for our fans on gamedays. Ensuring the safety and security of all Nissan Stadium guests is top priority. The clear bag is easily and quickly searched and greatly reduces faulty bag searches. It also supports the Department of Homeland Security's "If You See Something, Say Something" campaign.
How many bags can each person bring into the stadium?
One large clear bag – either a one-gallon Ziploc style bag or the 12" by 6" by 12" clear bag – plus a small clutch no larger than 4.5" x 6.5". The larger clear bag must be a standard 12" by 6" by 12" made of clear PVC vinyl and is easily searched. The one-gallon Ziploc bag is readily available, inexpensive and easily searched. The small clutch allows privacy for small personal items and also is easily searched.
Can fans carry cameras, binoculars, smart phones or tables separately from what they put in a clear bag?
Yes. Binoculars or a phone or camera can be carried into the stadium in its own bag, so long as the bag is 4.5" x 6.5" or smaller. Security personnel may ask you to remove your camera/binoculars from the case before reaching the gate for screening, to expedite entry. Camera and binoculars cases larger than 4.5" x 6.5" are not permitted.
Are seat cushions allowed to be carried into the stadium?
No, they are not due to the large size and because the way seat cushions are constructed would allow them to be used to conceal a potentially dangerous device.
Why haven't more stadiums and arenas adopted this kind of policy?
The NFL is the only professional sports league that has a comprehensive set of best practices for stadium security certified by the Department of Homeland Security as anti-terrorism technologies under the United States SAFETY Act. As such, other professional sports leagues look to the NFL as the leader in stadium and large venue security. Other stadiums have watched the NFL closely and followed, to the extent possible, security enhancements pioneered by the NFL. We anticipate that many more stadiums and arenas will soon adopt this policy.
If I have certain items that I need to bring into the stadium for medical reasons and they won't fit in the clear bag, what do I do?
There are designated Medical lanes to allow screening of medically necessary items. All Nissan Stadium gates have designated Medical lanes. Medical equipment and supplies (including liquid containers and coolers) will be thoroughly screened by security personnel at all gates. When feasible, medical equipment and supplies should also be placed in a clear bag to expedite inspection. Medically designated lanes are marked with a red Medical sign (this is typically the right-most lane at every gate).
