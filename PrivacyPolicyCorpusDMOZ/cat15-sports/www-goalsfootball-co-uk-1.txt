Terms and conditions.
General Terms and Conditions
COVID-19
By agreeing to our terms and conditions at booking, you and your group agree to abide by Government and FA guidelines outlining social distancing and group training sessions, in addition to our normal terms and conditions. These guidelines can be found here: England Coronavirus Guidelines, FA Guidelines, Scotland Coronavirus Guidelines. Goals reserves the right to stop play at any time due to lack of adherence.
Goals have introduced additional provisions across all sites to ensure customers are able to return in the safest possible way. Find out more about our enhanced safety features here. Download our COVID-19 General Risk Assessment here
Bookings made on our site
All bookings made via our site are subject to these terms and conditions and our code of conduct for players.
Contract: Our acceptance of your booking will take place when your payment is processed, or, if earlier, when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract is formed between you and us.
Reference number: We will endeavour to attach a reference number to each booking; however, we take no responsibility for reservations that have not received a booking reference. If you are unsure at any time in the reservation process as to whether your transaction has been completed, you should telephone the relevant club to check that the transaction has been completed and to obtain your booking reference number.
Price: The price of each booking will be as quoted on our site at the time the payment for your booking is processed. We shall not be liable for any technical mistake resulting in the display of an incorrect price.
Cancellation: We reserve our right to cancel your booking and any future bookings with us if we are refused authority for payment or reasonably believe that payment will be refused at any stage.
Payment: We use Sage Pay, a third-party payment specialist who are compliant with payment card industry data security standards (PCI DSS).
Goals will not store your card details without your permission and once you have entered your card number into a payment page securely hosted by Sage Pay, all payment data is encrypted and sent to the banks for processing. Some card details can be stored for your convenience but cannot be accessed by Goals and will still require security checks in order to be reused. Through Sage Pay, we have also enabled 3D Secure (Verified by Visa and SecureCode by MasterCard). This is an additional check. This box will appear and ask you to enter a selection of characters from your password e.g. first, third and fifth character. Do not be alarmed if this additional check appears. Other payment methods used are PayPal and other providers we may use from time to time. Such payment methods can be set up with such providers independently. When taking bookings, Goals enter into a contract with the person booking the pitch only. Where players pay individually, Goals are collecting this on behalf of the individual pitch booker and do not enter into a contract with each individual player.
Prepaid booking: If you have used a credit/debit card, full payment will be deducted from your card at the time of making your reservation via our site. Discounted booking offers made through online bookings cannot be cancelled and no refunds will be given. Please be aware that the credit or debit card used must be shown when arriving at Goals otherwise you will not be permitted to use the facilities. You may request payment from individual players via the app even after pre paying for a discounted booking. The overpayment value will be credited to your account and can be used to pay for a future booking but cannot be refunded. Refunding individual players will be the responsibility of the individual responsible for the pitch booking.
Online reservations (pay on arrival): Your credit/debit card will not be charged. You may pay for your bookings by either cash or card when at our branches.
Cancellation: Your reservation on the site can be cancelled at no charge by calling the relevant branch at which the booking has been before 2pm on the day of the booking. Cancelling your booking after this point, or failing to arrive, will result in a charge for the booking to your account, if payment is received within 7 days then 50% of the outstanding balance is all that’s required. Where payment(s) have been collected these will not be refunded, however provided the game is cancelled before 2pm on the day of the booking, then the full amount will be available to use for a future booking.
We may cancel or amend your booking at any time, in which case we will refund your booking payment, however we will not be liable for any costs, expenses or losses arising from such amendment or cancellation.
Pitch Use: Our pitches can only be used for playing football unless written agreement has been received by the Goals management.
