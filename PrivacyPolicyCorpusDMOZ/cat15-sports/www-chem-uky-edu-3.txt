The College of Arts and Sciences recognizes that all faculty have families and commitments outside of their professional life.  Many of the college's policies are created to help faculty facilitate their work while enhancing their life. For example, the college has a modified duties policy to help faculty adjust to the birth or adoption of a child.  The college also offers an excellent sabbatical leave policy (two-thirds salary for one year leave).  The links to the left should help you locate all of the college's policies aimed at facilitating faculty work.
