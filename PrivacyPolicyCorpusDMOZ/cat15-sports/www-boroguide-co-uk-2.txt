Home » Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyOur Privacy PolicyThis is the privacy policy for BoroGuide [www.boroguide.co.uk]… or the “website”, just to keep things nice and simple later on. It ain’t the most riveting read you’ll stumble across on here, but it does set out what we do to protect your privacy.It goes without saying that our privacy policy applies to all parts of this website (see, told you it keeps things nice and simple).Here at BoroGuide, we’re dead keen on respecting and protecting your personal info. We don’t actually ask for or collect your details that often. There are, however, a few things that we need to make you aware of for your own benefit. And to comply with the law, y’know… Why Do We Collect Info From You?Don’t panic. We don’t want to stalk you. Any information we collect from you is mainly to make this website better. Some information we collect will help us monitor performance of pages and features; other information is used to display adverts that might be of interest to you. What Info Do We Collect From You?There are a few ways we collect information from you, which are:Cookies that provide us with details about your visit to BoroGuide. We can’t use any of this info to identify you as a person, however. We’re talking about location, your device (desktop or mobile) and other similar stats; stuff that informs our website experience. For more about this, see our Cookies Policy.If you’re interested in advertising on BoroGuide, we provide a form for you to get in touch. This asks for a name, email address and message. We need this information so we can get back to you and talk to you about our advertising options etc.Our email address can be found in places if you need to get in touch with us. That applies to advertising or media enquiries, as well as general contact. Again, we need at least an email address from you if you were hoping for us to respond to you.Our blog provides you with the facility to comment. You don’t have to provide your name or email address; we give you the option to provide it if you want to display your details with your comment. We guess it depends how profound you think your musings are? Your ConsentWe don’t use your personal information for direct marketing activities, but we will use it to contact you if you’ve filled out a form or emailed us in the first instance. If you do reach out to us, you’re welcome to request that we delete your personal information at any point. And if you comment on our blog, you’re free to delete it. This also removes your personal data.In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, you *must* consent to providing your personal information when filling out a form on our website or commenting on one of our articles. We will also give you the ability to opt-out from receiving the cookies we use on this site.

To give you an example, data that we collect via Google Analytics may well be transferred to the US and held on Google servers. By providing your info, you agree to this transfer. That said, we will take all reasonable steps to make sure your data is kept secure and in compliance with our privacy policy.The data that you provide us with is stored on secure servers.

We cannot and will not take any responsibility for how you use those websites, and how any information you supply to those websites is then used. Our privacy policy extends to the outer reaches of BoroGuide and BoroGuide alone. And, no, we’re not responsible for Borochat. That ship has long since sailed… Website RecordingWe use Google Analytics to help us track what you are looking at when you visit BoroGuide.
