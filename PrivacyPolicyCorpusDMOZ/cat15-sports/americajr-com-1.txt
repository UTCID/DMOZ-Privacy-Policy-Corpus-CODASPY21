collects your personal information (such as your name, address
and phone number) when you register for a contest or another
sort of prize. We will only use it for the purposes of mailing
out prizes and/or consolation prize. After you have received
a prize in the mail, your personal information will then be
deleted and never used thereafter.
Upon
receiving your personal information, we guarantee not to sell
it to other organizations, businesses or companies. Your privacy
is important to us. AmericaJR.com will add your e-mail address
to our mailing list and you will receive a request for confirmation.
Your approval is necessary before you will begin receiving
e-mails from us. If you do not approve, you will not receive
another word from us. We will not fill up your mailbox with
SPAM. AmericaJR.com is now CAN-SPAM compliant. Our mailing list
comes out three times a week with updates on news, contests,
and our weekly polls. However, you have the option of un subscribing
from our mailing list by clicking on the link at the bottom
of each email. It will be done in a prompt manner without further
questions.
If you
are not selected as the winner of a contest, you may receive
a consolation prize. These constellation prizes include magnets,
pens and other items to be determined by AmericaJR.com. There
is no guarantee that you will receive a constellation prize,
due to the number of entries.
AmericaJR.com
may publish a list of names for winners of our contests. We
will also include your city and state of residence. If you wish
to have your name not included in our winners list, please send
an e-mail to americajr@yahoo.com.

out, please send an email to americajr@yahoo.com.
You may access our list of constellation prize recipients at

At the
bottom each contest entry, there is a field that reads “What
is your favorite part of AmericaJR.com?” Keep in mind
