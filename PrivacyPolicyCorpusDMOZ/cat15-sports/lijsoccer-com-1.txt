Long Island Junior Soccer League
Purpose
To help prevent physical assault and verbal abuse during sanctioned events the Long Island Junior Soccer League (LIJSL), has adopted a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. This policy applies to all coaches, players, parents, spectators and other supporters and referees effective immediately.
Abusive and obscene language, violent play/conduct, fighting and other behavior (including, but not limited to sarcasm, taunting, etc.) deemed detrimental to the game will not be tolerated. The ultimate responsibility for the actions of coaches, players and spectators resides with all LIJSL member clubs. It is the responsibility of the coaches to provide referee support and spectator control, and it is the responsibility of the LIJSL member club to provide instructions to their coaches on how to implement sportsmanlike behavior.
This policy applies before, during and after the sanctioned event at the soccer field and its immediate surrounding areas.
Remember: the referee does not have to show a yellow card before showing a red card.
Parents & Spectators
No parent or spectator shall persistently address the referee or assistant referees at any time.
This includes, but is not limited to:
Parents and spectators shall not dispute calls during or after the game.Parents and spectators shall not make remarks to the referee(s) or advise the referee(s) to watch certain players or attend to rough play.Parents and spectators shall never yell at the referee(s), including criticism, sarcasm, harassment, intimidation or feedback of any kind before, during or after the game.Additionally, parents and spectators shall not make derogatory comments to players, spectators or coaches of either team.
Penalties (Parents & Spectators)
In the opinion of the referee, depending on the severity of the offense, the referee may take any of the following actions:
The referee may issue a verbal warning to the coach of offending party’s team.The referee may stop the game and instruct the coaches to direct the parent /spectator to leave the field.The referee may abandon the game if the parent/spectator does not leave the field which will result in the offending team forfeiting the game and being assessed the appropriate fees and/or fines.
The ultimate responsibility for the actions of the spectators resides with LIJSL member clubs. Clubs will be held accountable for the actions of their parents/spectators and may be subject to penalties and/or fines for grievous actions. A club taking NO action with a parent/spectator after being issued a warning by LIJSL may be put in bad standing with LIJSL. Additionally a team, player or coach may be suspended from all future competitions until such time appropriate action has been taken with the parent/spectator to the satisfaction of the LIJSL.
Players
The conduct of the players is governed by the Laws of the Game as stated by FIFA and USSF. The Laws themselves describe penalties associated with violating the Laws of the Game. Additional penalties for players who engage in misconduct may be established by the club or LIJSL but may in no case be less severe than penalties established by FIFA, USSF, ENY or the LIJSL. In severe cases of unsporting behavior and violent conduct players will be called into a hearing with either LIJSL arbitration and or the LIJSL supervisory committee with his/her coach and/or parents for further disciplinary action. A club may also be fined for such matters. A player called to a hearing that does not appear, will be suspended from play until such time of appearance.
Coaches, Assistant Coaches & Trainers
It is the responsibility of all coaches to maintain the highest standards of conduct for themselves, their players and supporters in all matches. Failure to do so undermines the referee’s authority and the integrity of the game resulting in a hostile environment for players, the referee(s), coaches, assistant coaches, trainers and parents/spectators.
As role models for all of the participants and spectators, coaches participating in a LIJSL, ENYYSA or USYSA sanctioned event are expected to be supportive of, and to acknowledge the effort, good play and sportsmanship on the part of ALL players from either team in a game. By example, coaches, assistant coaches and trainers are expected to show that although they are competing in a game, they have respect for their opponent, referees and spectators at all times.
The Long Island Junior Soccer League will not tolerate negative behavior exhibited either by demonstrative actions and gestures, or by ill-intentioned remarks, including those addressed toward the referees or members of an opposing team. Coaches exhibiting hostile, negative, sarcastic or otherwise ill-intended behavior toward referees, opposing players or coaches will be subject to disciplinary action by the Long Island Junior Soccer League. Additional sanctions may be imposed by the club that the coach or assistant coach represents, or as allowed by Long Island Junior Soccer League policies.
Coaches shall not interact directly or indirectly with the coaches or players of the opposing team during the game in any manner that may be construed as negative, hostile or sarcastic either by way of demonstrative actions and gestures or by ill intentioned remarks.Coaches shall not offer dissent to any call made by the referee(s) at any timeCoaches are not to address the Referee(s) during the game except to:Respond to a referee who has initiated a conversation.Point out emergency or safety issues.Make substitutions.Absolutely no sarcasm, harassment or intimidation is allowed.
NOTE: It is recommended that coaches or other team members do not engage in any conversation with the referee(s) once the game has concluded.
Penalties (Coaches, Assistant Coaches, Trainers)
In the opinion of the referee, depending on the severity of the offense, the referee may take any of the following actions:
The referee may issue a verbal warning to the offending coach, assistant coach or trainer.The referee may eject the offending coach, assistant coach or trainer. Once ejected, the individual will be required to leave the field immediately.The referee should abandon the game, if the coach, assistant coach or trainer does not leave the field or any immediate adjoining area after having been instructed to do so.
Additional penalties associated with the ejection of a coach, assistant coach or trainer may be assessed by an LIJSL member club in accordance with their documented policy. These penalties may be no less stringent than sanctions and/or fines as may be imposed by LIJSL following a review of the incident.
All cases of alleged assault of a referee shall be reported to the ENYYSA Office and State Referee Administrator within 48 hours of the match. LIJSL will also conduct a verification of the complaint and subsequent actions and may at their discretion impose additional penalties to the coach, assistant coach, trainer and or club.
LIJSL member clubs are responsible for the behavior of their coaches, assistant coaches, and trainers at all times.
Games Disbanded Prior to the Conclusion by the Referee:
When a game is disbanded by the referee prior to it’s conclusion due to unsporting behavior on the part of one or both teams, the LIJSL will conduct an investigation and will issue a forfeit to either one or both teams and possibly from further competitions. The offending club(s) will also be assessed a fine which must be paid prior to the next team registration or the LIJSL member club will be put in bad standing with LIJSL. In cases of extreme unsportsmanlike behavior, in the opinion of the LIJSL, a team, player, coach, assistant coach or trainer may be banned from any further LIJSL or ENY sanctioned events and competitions.
Suspension, Banning of Players, Parents/Spectators, Coaches, Assistant Coaches or Trainers
If a player, parent/spectator, coach, assistant coach or trainer is suspended/banned by LIJSL or any LIJSL member club he/she is not be allowed to participate or have any interaction with their team until they are reinstated. If a player, parent/spectator, coach, assistant coach or trainer is suspended they are suspended from all LIJSL and ENY sanctioned events.
If a player, parent/spectator, coach, assistant coach or trainer wishes to attend a tournament they may request a temporary pass in writing from either the player or coach arbitration committee. The arbitration committees reserve the right to refuse to issue a temporary pass for a tournament if the suspension has resulted from a grievous action or the issuance of a temporary pass could endanger the health, welfare and safety of those attending the tournament. Tournament games missed will not be considered as part of the suspension.
LIJSL as a youth organization reserves the right to suspend/ban any participant that endangers the health, welfare and safety of its membership.
