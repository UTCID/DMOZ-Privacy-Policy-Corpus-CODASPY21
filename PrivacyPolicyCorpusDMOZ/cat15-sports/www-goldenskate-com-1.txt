Did You Know?
Maribel Vinson-Owen (October 12, 1911 – February 15, 1961) set the record for nine U.S. ladies’ figure skating titles which Michelle Kwan matched in 2005. As a single skater, she was the 1932 Olympic bronze medalist and a two-time World medalist (1928 silver, 1930 bronze). Vinson-Owen (as a coach) and her two daughters were part of the United States figure skating team that tragically died on Sabena Flight 548.
