Website Security
Website Security
Our website is secured by SSL to ensure data transferred between our server and your device is encrypted. Our email server is also secured by SSL.
We have security software and procedures in place on our website to reduce the risks of a data breach. For example, login forms are protected so that if you enter the wrong login details five times within five minutes, you will be suspended from logging in for a further five minutes. This deters brute force attacks from bots. We have a firewall on our website that will immediately ban or limit suspicious web traffic depending on its type.
Our entire server is backed up on daily basis and is securely transferred to an Amazon Web Services storage facility in Ireland. We retain Monday to Saturday’s backups for seven days. Sunday’s backup is retained for one calendar month.

If a data breach is detected, in the first instance we will evaluate the risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. If a data breach is likely to result in a risk to these rights and freedoms we will notify the Information Commissioner’s Office within the required 72 hours of discovery of the data breach. If a data breach is not likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we are not required to notify the ICO of the breach but will document the breach and our reasons for not notifying the ICO.
Where a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we will notify the affected individuals without undue delay.
