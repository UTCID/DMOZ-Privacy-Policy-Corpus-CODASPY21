We respect the privacy of fans, our customers, and members. Therefore, we want everyone to know the following:
We value your privacy as we do our own. We do not disclose the personal information, e-mail addresses, or IP addresses of anyone who posts on this site to outside organizations or persons except upon receipt of a legally valid order from a court or for resolution of technical issues (such as to our web services partners).

Please read the guidelines and limitations on that removal below. Such removal may result in the user's inability to interact with this site. As part of our data retention policy and for security purposes, we may delete accounts that have been inactive for more than two years and where the user has never engaged in any meaningful activity.
Our web server automatically collects some information about visitors to our web site when a request is made by a visitor for a web page.

This is so that data such as the web pages requested can be sent.)  We collect only the domain name or IP address, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web pages. We collect information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations and e-mail addresses of those who voluntarily subscribe to our newsletters, enter our contests, or submit Grand Final party information.

We will only use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site, and to gather broad demographic information about users in a particular geographic area. We log the host name of computers to our secure files which are available only to the webmaster, senior officers, and those managing our servers.  The information we collect is used to improve the content of our site, used to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and shared in summary form with other reputable organizations for purposes of joint marketing. If illegal or impermissible activity is detected, the IP address will also be used to ban access to this site from that IP address. When such information is provided to outside organizations, for example the number of visitors to a particular page at this site, it does not identify individuals.
This information collected by this site does not however, contain anything that can identify individual visitors or users on a personal basis including the e-mail address unless you choose to provide it.  However, certain areas of our site, such as registered access, some contact forms, and Grand Final party submissions require your valid e-mail address and telephone number for registration purposes in order to ensure a safe site for all visitors.  Your valid registration information is also required if you wish to post information to this site.  (This is done to limit spammers and for security purposes.)  We may use your e-mail address to contact registered users of this site on a periodic bases. Individual users access to particular web pages on this site may be identifiable by their IP address or site registration. This data is not used for any other purpose and is not disclosed to 3rd or outside parties except as needed to resolve technical issues. It is never disclosed for marketing purposes.

We do not collect "cookies" or similar web related data except to save configuration information for users of this site including our forums (bulletin board), photo gallery, TV schedules, and any page where user specific configuration is needed.  We use cookies in these areas to store visitors' preferences, customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

We carry paid advertisements from various advertisers including Google. Other advertisers may appear from time to time. We do not share any individual user information with these companies. We do provide them with collective summaries of the frequency their advertisements are displayed and how many users click their advertisements.

We have a marketing relationship with these companies:  WatchAFL Global, DubPies. No information we receive as a result of these relationships is shared with them without prior disclosure.

We will not disclose any member's or customer's personal data (such as street address or e-mail address) we may have to outside companies, third parties, or individuals and we use it only for internal purposes. We do not distribute, share, or sell our mailing list to the public but we may share portions of it to other members for purposes directly related to Australian football and under our control. We may also use it for our own purposes in promoting Australian football or sharing with fans information related to the sport. Aggregate data, such as the distribution of ages of our site users or a summary of locations our site users may be used by ourselves or our partners without prior notice. Any such use will not identify individuals. However, upon receipt of a certified order of a court of law, information on any user may be disclosed in order to comply with said order.
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy notice. You may always opt out of receiving any future mail from us or future use of this site as noted above.

With respect to security: To the extent possible, we use secure web technologies whenever you access this site including HTTPS, HSTS, and TLS.
