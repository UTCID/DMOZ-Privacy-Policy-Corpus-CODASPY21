David Beckham needs help with Inter Miami CF as it’s all about looking homeDavid Beckham made a superstar status for himself under Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. He won league titles, FA Cups and played his part in a dramatic Champions League triumph too, to complete the famous ’99 treble.He moved onto Spanish giants Real Madrid, becoming a part of the Galactico era, where not only did his career continue to hit new heights, but so did his brand. He was a leading light for both club and country. Then came a move to LA Galaxy. Admittedly, shocking.A transfer in 2007, which I’m pretty sure sent the English media into meltdown, but I was only 11 at this point. It’s still impressive to this day. Beckham saw potential in a league that many this side of the Atlantic are still yet to really see. Was money an aspect? Most probably. Was the ability to grow his brand Stateside a factor? Yes.Whilst he moved onto PSG, with a stint training back at Tottenham, where he started his youth career, Beckham gave what was still considered to be some of his better years to the Los Angeles Galaxy, and to the MLS.  Now, he’s back. This time as an owner of a club. Fresh-faced to his role, as inexperienced as you could expect. Yet, aware of how the business works.Whilst Beckham was happy to dedicate some of his more golden years to the MLS, many other top tier footballers have waited until they’re on the verge of retirement to make the move over. Gerrard, Lampard, Robbie Keane, Ibrahimovic, and currently Javier Hernandez.This hasn’t helped the MLS rebrand itself from a retirement league status. No matter how many times a young, talented name is cherry-picked from a top European club’s academy and dropped into an MLS side, the league still can’t shake its stereotype.My idea for Inter Miami CF definitely won’t stop the retirement league jokes. Here goes nothing, sign players such as Jack Wilshere, Kyle Walker, and Danny Rose to assist with creating an experienced culture, on top of what Matuidi may bring.Why? Well, starting a new club is extremely challenging. Believe me, I run a men’s amateur league club with about 25 players in the squad. I’ve learned that you need experienced leaders in your roster from the get-go. Players who are aware they may only have so much left in the tank, but still believe they have a lot to offer around the club.More from MLS MultiplexMLS: Young talent shines in opening rounds of playoffsToronto FC: It’s time for a complete reset this offseasonMLS Playoffs: Where the unimaginable happens at any given timeAtlanta United: A much-needed rebuild is coming but patience is neededUSMNT: Sergino Dest opens scoring account with BarcelonaLook at Spurs, they’ve just signed former England and Manchester City Goalkeeper, Joe Hart. Whilst he’s joked about not being anywhere near his best anymore, Mourinho has identified that Tottenham’s dressing room needs another leading voice.A self-aware, leading voice. One that’s been there and done that. That can issue help to younger players and produce words of wisdom to those on the cusp of their own greatness.A qualified player who doesn’t demand the game-time that many in their prime or developing years need and require to continue to shine. Creating a well-balanced squad is what any club who hopes to win sets about doing.Lionel Messi has caused a stir, swiftly followed by a minor riot, at Barcelona by trying to force a move. Many have spoken about the possibility of a switch to an MLS Club, especially Inter Miami CF thanks to Beckham’s pull. But, for me, it’s completely unrealistic to expect him to look towards the MLS when Manchester City exists as well as his boyhood club, Newell’s Old Boys, in Argentina.However, his current teammate Luis Saurez could be a brilliant and realistic addition, as well as Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa. Nevertheless, whilst all these players still feel they can offer top European clubs something special, and whilst they’re still being linked with these clubs, it’s a stretch to see them give up hopes of Champions League titles to play in Miami.West Ham’s aging but experienced duo in Wilshere and Noble could be an excellent start to asserting knowledge of the game onto younger stars, assisting in the growth of Inter Miami CF. Jack Wilshere has always been considered to be a major voice in the dressing room. Whether that was apart of Arsenal’s FA Cup-winning sides, or abroad with England.Kyle Walker is possibly only a year or two away from having to move on from Manchester City. Danny Rose may be finished at Spurs. Both of these players can offer Beckham and Inter Miami CF something as special as they offered Mauricio Pochettino in 2016 and 2017. Both of these players are also renowned leaders in the dressing room and are entering what could be the final stages of their careers.

Beckham has the ability to entice players to join his shiny, new Florida Soccer Club. Finding the correct balance between youth and experience from leagues far away, to help develop and nurture a team that could lead to a Miami golden era. Running parallels with what Sir Alex Ferguson embarked on during the 1990s with Manchester United.
