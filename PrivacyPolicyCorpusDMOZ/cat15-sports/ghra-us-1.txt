Who we are
Our website address is: https://ghra.us.
What personal data we collect and why we collect it
We do not sell, loan, or give personal data from our site visitors to any third parties.
Our security plugin logs site visitors by IP address and records pages visited. This enables us to detect potential hackers and spammers, if needed, but gives us no personal data about our visitors aside from the country of the IP address.
If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we ask only for your name and e-mail address, and you have the option to unsubscribe at any time.
If you post a comment to one of our articles, or to our contact us form, we collect your IP address, and whatever name and e-mail address you submit to the form, as well as whatever comment or message you leave.
To contact us you may use our Contact Us form
Plugin: Smush
Note: Smush does not interact with end users on your website. The only input option Smush has is to a newsletter subscription for site admins only. If you would like to notify your users of this in your privacy policy, you can use the information below.
Smush sends images to the WPMU DEV servers to optimize them for web use. This includes the transfer of EXIF data. The EXIF data will either be stripped or returned as it is. It is not stored on the WPMU DEV servers.
Smush uses a third-party email service (Drip) to send informational emails to the site administrator. The administrator’s email address is sent to Drip and a cookie is set by the service. Only administrator information is collected by Drip.
