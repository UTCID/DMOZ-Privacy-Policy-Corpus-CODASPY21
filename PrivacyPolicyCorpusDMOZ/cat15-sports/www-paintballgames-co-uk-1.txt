Jamie Wilson
Bristol
"The staff were superb and couldn't do enough for us; they helped us carry bags in, offered us tea and coffee, and kept checking to make sure all was good. Zoe and Joe were excellent marshals. We will definitely use you again and recommend."
B Thorp

"Me and all my friends loved every minute of it and we will definitely be back soon. I would love to give a massive thank you to Callum and lads from Delta Force Paintball as they provided us with a safe and yet very fun experience."

"The 2 marshals Zeke and Fifi were great, they did a really good job in looking after the players on my team and controlled the game zones well and kept some players in check. Thanks to both of them and Delta Force."
