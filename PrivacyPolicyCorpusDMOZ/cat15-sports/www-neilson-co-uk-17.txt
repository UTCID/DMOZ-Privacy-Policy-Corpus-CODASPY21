Accommodation & facilities
What room types are available?The rooms at our beachclubs are split into three main categories. The majority are called "club" rooms. At most of our beachclubs we have some "premium" rooms too. Premium rooms may be bigger; be more convenient for some of the facilities or have a particularly special view. At some of our beachclubs, there are a small number of "economy" rooms. These rooms may be smaller, less convenient or have a less-attractive view - it varies room-by-room, beachclub-by-beachclub. These rooms are a great value way to enjoy a Neilson holiday; yes it's a cheaper room but you still get to enjoy all the great facilities and activities the beachclub has to offer. In addition to these three types of room, many of our beachclubs also have a range of suites and inter-connecting rooms that are great for families. Can I book interconnecting rooms on your beachclub holidays?Yes, most of our beachclubs have interconnecting rooms. Simply search for one room and any available options will be shown when selecting your room.Is Wi-Fi available in the beachclubs?There's free Wi-Fi in the public areas and in most of the rooms at all of our beachclubs.What meals are included?The majority of our beachclubs offer club board. Club board includes breakfast every day, lunch every day whilst in the resort and four evening meals per week. Guests staying at Cosmos Beachclub are on bed and breakfast.
