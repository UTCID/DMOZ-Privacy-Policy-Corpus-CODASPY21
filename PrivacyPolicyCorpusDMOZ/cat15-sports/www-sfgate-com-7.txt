SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Kevin Pillar homered against his former team and German Márquez pitched six strong innings to snap a five-game losing streak as the Colorado Rockies stalled San Francisco’s playoff pursuit, beating the Giants 7-2 on Monday night.
In the opener of an eight-game road trip to end the season, the Rockies knocked around Johnny Cueto for seven earned runs in 4 1/3 innings.
“He didn’t have his best stuff and his command was off,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said. “Against a team like the Rockies, who are kind of free swingers up and down the lineup, if you’re missing in the zone, they can punish you for that.”
The Giants (26-27) trail the Philadelphia Phillies by a half-game for the final postseason spot in the National League. The Rockies (24-29) are 2 1/2 games back.
Colorado didn’t waste any time, scoring two runs in the first on RBI singles by Josh Fuentes and Ryan McMahon. Pillar’s sixth homer of the season made it 3-0 in the third, and the Rockies added another run in the fourth on a balk.
“It always feels good coming back, playing against a former team and being able to perform, especially after a team has the ability to bring you back but they don’t want you back for whatever reason,” Pillar said. “Offensively, it was nice to get things going. Top to bottom of the lineup, we all had good at-bats.”
Colorado kept piling on in the fifth with a two-run single by Elias Diaz and an RBI single from Garrett Hampson. The seven runs allowed by Cueto (2-2) were a season high.
Márquez (3-6) limited the Giants to one run and five hits, striking out three.
“I thought the fastball had good velocity to it,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “He had conviction with the fastball. The little bit of variability with the breaking ball, which for him is uncharacteristic. He did throw some good ones.”
Donovan Solano got San Francisco on the board in the fifth with an RBI single. He finished 2 for 4, raising his team-leading batting average to .341.
Alex Dickerson cut the Rockies’ lead to 7-2 with a home run in the seventh, his ninth of the season. Dickerson, reinstated from the paternity list before the game, also had a single and a double before being hit by a pitch on the right elbow in the ninth inning. He stayed in to run the bases, and postgame X-rays were negative.
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
The Giants will enter a transitional quarantine period Wednesday ahead of a potential playoff appearance. The team will stay in a hotel, despite finishing the regular season at home.
“The idea is to test, protect and give us our best chance at being healthy and strong into the postseason,” Kapler said.

Rockies: 3B Nolan Arenado was placed on the 10-day injured list with a left shoulder bone bruise and AC joint inflammation, ending his regular season. He had played through nagging soreness for most of the year, batting .253 with eight home runs and 26 RBIs. “I think rest will do it well,” Arenado said. “I don’t think this will linger on if I take care of it the right way, which I will.”
