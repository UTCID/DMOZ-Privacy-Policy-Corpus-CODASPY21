However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of UOL's Internet servers. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to UOL only when voluntarily submitted by the users. UOL will only use personally identifiable data provided at this site for the purposes described at the time it is collected (for example, the e-mail addresses visitors provide in order to receive e-mail alerts will only be used for the purpose of sending these e-mail alerts). The information we collect from users is processed and maintained in the United States, where privacy laws may not be as protective as in your home country. If you are using our Web site from outside of the United States, by providing information to us you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States for processing in a manner consistent with these Terms of Use. UOL sites, as well as any other third party sites linked to or from this Web site, may each have different privacy policies and practices. You should carefully review these other Web sites' privacy policies in order to determine how each site may use any personal information you provide.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
Cookies and other Technical Information
We may send "cookies" to your computer. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique user and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
By accepting these Terms of Use, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons.
