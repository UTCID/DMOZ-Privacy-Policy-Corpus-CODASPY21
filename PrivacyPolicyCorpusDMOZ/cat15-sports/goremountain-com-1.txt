Snow Report
We plan to Spin the Northwoods Gondola and Topridge Triple this Weekend!
Come outside and play with us- all this snow our fabulous snowmakers have been providing is making our almost five miles of terrain extra fun for Friday! Explore further over on the North Side with Sleeping Bear & Tahawus, or go check out a chill ride down Sunway, Quicksilver, and 3B. For Saturday, we are thrilled to spin the Northwoods Gondola and Topridge Triple with access to the trail Topridge as well as Foxlair! Lots of snowmaking is happening on Topridge, Foxlair, Tannery, Showcase, and Pine Knot.
Please note: The upper portion of Twister is open for freestyle and access to Showcase only. Open terrain is for intermediate and advanced abilities.
