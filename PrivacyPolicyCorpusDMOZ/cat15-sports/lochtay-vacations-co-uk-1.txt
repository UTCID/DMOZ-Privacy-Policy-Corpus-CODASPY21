Building profiles and targeting communications
We use profiling and screening techniques to ensure that the communications and offers we send you are personalised, relevant and timely.  We do this because it allows us to understand your background and the background of our guests and enables us to improve your holiday experience.  We also do this so that we can communicate with you in the way that suits you best and to help ensure that you only receive communications and offers that are likely to be of interest to you.
We also use profiling techniques and the information you provide us while you are on one of our sites to better understand what you like doing, for example what restaurants and activities you use. We do this so we can improve our products and services and your experience while you are on holiday with us.
As part of our profiling activities, we will take into account factors such as geographic, demographic and other information relating to you so that we can better understand your interests and preferences. To do this we may use additional information from third party sources when it is available. Such information is compiled using publicly available data about you, for example number of children, age of children, these can be at a variety of levels from postcode area to individual households.
Marketing
So that you are the first to hear about our exciting new offers, activities and facilities, you can opt in to receive this information when you book your Largo Leisure Break. You have the option to opt in to our marketing communications.
If you have given us your consent to receive marketing communications by email, are customers of ours or you have previously asked us for information about our breaks or experiences, we may also send you this information by email. However, in every marketing email message we send you, we will give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our mailings altogether as well as updating your information.
We use your personal information to tailor the marketing communications we send to you. For example, we track your booking history with us in terms of the accommodation you choose and the activities you and the members of your party do in order to build a picture of the things you like and dislike.  This enables us to provide you with a more personalised service, and give you information about offers and activities, which are more likely to be of interest to you.  We do not provide your personal information to external organisations (i.e. outside of Largo Leisure Holidays) for their own marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
If at any time you do not want your information used for direct marketing purposes or if you decide that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, please either follow the unsubscribe link in one of our marketing email messages or contact us by emailing marketing@lochtay-vacations.co.uk. Please note that if you have a forthcoming booking we will send you service related emails, even if you have unsubscribed from marketing communications, as this is important information you will require for your forthcoming break.

Our group. Your personal information may be shared with other companies within the Largo Leisure group of companies based in the UK because we operate centralised systems. We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business.

We always keep control of your data and our suppliers must act in accordance with our instructions.
Our partners. We will only ever share your personal information with our carefully selected partners and in a manner that does not identify you as an individual or which allows our research partner to identify you as an individual.  We do this with social media partners, such as Facebook and Twitter to participate in their Custom Audience and/or Lookalike Audience programs so that you can receive targeted ads from us when you use the social media site, and so that other users of the site who share similar interests to you can also receive targeted ads from us.
