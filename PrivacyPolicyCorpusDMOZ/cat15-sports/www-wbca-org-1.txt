Privacy Policy
You are hereHome
The Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) recognizes the importance of protecting our users' privacy. To that end we have created the privacy statement and spam policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.
Information on how site content can and cannot be used is also listed below. What Information is Collected
WBCA and its web hosting company, acting as WBCA's agent, collect and store technical information about your visit to our website. We use this information for statistical purposes to make our site more accessible to visitors and the information we collect is not provided to any other third party. Specifically, we may record:
The name of the domain from which you access the Internet.
The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, if any.
The type of web browsing software and operating system you are using to view our site.
The date and time you access our site.
The pages you visit on our site.
The amount of time spent on the site.
Some parts of the WBCA website may use a cookie, which is a file placed on your computer hard drive, that allows the WBCA web server to log the pages you use in the WBCA site and to determine if you have visited the site before. The WBCA server uses this information to provide certain features during your visit to the website. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested and decide whether or not to accept it. By rejecting a cookie, some of the features available on the site may not function properly. We do not use cookies to collect personal information (email address, etc.)
Throughout the website there may be forms to request information, products and services. These forms typically ask for contact information (such as your phone, address or email address), financial information (such as your credit card numbers), and demographic information (for example, company product categories, areas of interest, location, etc.) Contact information from these forms is used to send the products, promotional materials or membership information that you request. How Information Collected is Used
Demographic and profile data collected on our site may be added to a database maintained by WBCA.Links to Other Sites
The website contains links to other websites. WBCA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. Inclusion of links to an outside website, whether in an advertisement or content area of WBCA's website, is not an endorsement of the website or a guarantee that the information it contains is accurate. Comment Areas
This site makes comment areas available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal or business information. Security
This site uses physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect information collected online including firewalls to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The use of these security measures is not a guarantee that information supplied over the Internet will not be intercepted. Choice/Opt-Out or Corrections/Updates
Users of our website have the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners. If you no longer wish to receive any future communications or need to change or modify information previously provided, please follow the instructions below:
WBCA members: Please log in to the website and click the update profile form. Choose my communication preferences or contact the WBCA Membership Department at membership@wbca.org or 770-279-8027.
Non-members: Contact the WBCA Membership Department at membership@wbca.org or 770-279-8027. You may also click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email.
**Note: Membership dues communications are a requirement of membership and, therefore, no opt-out option exists.**
E-communications
The WBCA send frequent e-newsletters and e-notices of its upcoming meetings, webinars or other benefit programs. Because computer security is very strict — especially on school and university servers — communications are often sorted as junk. To make sure these emails land in your inbox, we recommend that you add membership@wbca.org to your contacts list or ask your IT office to whitelist the wbca.org domain.
Convention
Exhibitors, partnering organizations or sponsors may be provided with mailing addresses of conference registrants before and after WBCA Convention.
Many exhibitors collect business cards or collect attendee information at their booths during the convention. If you supply this information to an exhibitor at a booth, the WBCA views this as voluntarily providing information to the vendor. This is how many vendors build their marketing lists. If you receive materials following the WBCA Convention via email or receive a phone call, please be assured this information did NOT come from the WBCA, but possibly did come from the information you provided to an exhibitor during the convention.Mailings
The WBCA may allow certain sponsors, partners or vendors to do a limited number of mailings to our members to inform you of their products and services. Member Directory
Among the most valuable benefits of WBCA membership is the ability to connect with a colleague in our sport. For that reason the WBCA maintains profile information and has a searchable, online directory of members. This tool is accessible to current WBCA members only. Members and/or vendors are prohibited from harvesting contact information from the WBCA Member Directory.Change in Terms of Privacy
WBCA reserves the right to alter its privacy policies. Any changes to the policy will be posted on this page.
This site is controlled and operated by WBCA from its offices within the United States. WBCA makes no representations that materials, information, or content available on or through this site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where such materials, information, or content are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this site from other locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.Site Content
You may access, download and print materials on this website for your personal and non-commercial use. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, software, products or services obtained from this website without first obtaining written consent from WBCA. Furthermore, you may not use the materials found on this website on any other websites or in a networked environment without first obtaining written consent from WBCA.
All materials on this site (as well as the organization and layout of the site) are owned and copyrighted by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. © Copyright Women's Basketball Coaches Association 2010. All rights reserved. No reproduction, distribution, or transmission of the copyrighted materials at this site is permitted without the written permission of the WBCA. Spam Policy
All email and electronic communications with members should adhere to the following principles:
You should have a prior relationship with the person receiving your email. (Someone giving you their business card is acceptable in this regard-it implies permission to get in contact. Similarly if someone has sent you an email.)
A valid "from" and "reply to" address must be included with each message.
If you have a subscription list, you should send a confirmation email that the person wishes to be on the list.
There should always be a quick way to unsubscribe from any mail list.
Any request to cease mailing from an individual or organization should be quickly honored.
A complaint involving a breach of this policy may be considered a violation of the WBCA Code of Ethics, and therefore referred to the WBCA Ethics Committee for their consideration. Should they find a breach occurred, remedies may be required. Sanctions may also be imposed such as suspending or terminating the coach's membership, convention credential, ability to exhibit or advertise with the WBCA.
International members may be asked periodically to confirm their opt in status.
