11 INTERVALS
11.1 An interval
11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals.
- Intervals between innings.
- Time-Outs
- Any other agreed interval.
11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause24.2.6.
11.2 Duration of interval
11.2.1 There shall be a 20 minute interval between innings, taken from the call of Time before the interval until the call of Play on resumption after the interval.11.3 Allowance for interval between innings
Law 11.3 shall not apply.
11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals
11.4.1 If the innings of the team batting first is completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval shall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence correspondingly earlier.In circumstances where the side bowling first has not completed the allotted number of overs by the scheduled or re-scheduled cessation time for the first innings, the umpires shall reduce the length of the interval by the amount of time that the first innings over-ran. The minimum time for the interval in an uninterrupted match will be 15 minutes.
11.4.2 However, following a lengthy delay or interruption prior to the completion of the innings of the team batting first, the IPL Match Referee may, at his discretion, reduce the interval between innings from 20 minutes to not less than 10 minutes. 11.4.3 Such discretion should only be exercised after determining the adjusted overs per side based on a 20 minute interval. If having exercised this discretion, the rescheduled finishing time for the match is earlier than the latest possible finishing time, then these minutes should be deducted from the length of any interruption during the second innings before determining the overs remaining. 11.5 Intervals for drinks
11.5.1 No drinks intervals shall be permitted.
11.5.2 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, provided that no playing time is wasted. No other drinks shall be taken onto the field without the permission of the umpires. Any player taking drinks onto the field shall be dressed in proper cricket attire (subject to the wearing of bibs – refer to the note in clause 24.1.4).11.6 Time-Outs
11.6.1 There will be two time-outs of 2 minutes 30 seconds in duration in each innings. The time-outs are to allow the teams to re-group tactically. Umpires and players must start to move back into their positions after 2 minutes in order to resume play when the countdown clock reaches zero seconds.11.6.2 Drinks may be brought out on to the field during the time-out. No practice is allowed.
11.6.3 Subject to clauses 11.6.4 and 11.6.8 below, the above-mentioned time-outs will occur in each innings of matches which are not Interrupted (such that the scheduled number of overs in respect of such innings remains 20) at the following times: (a) at the end of either the 6th,7th, 8th or 9th over at the election of the fielding team and (b) at the end of either the 13th, 14th 15th or 16th over at the election of the batting team. 11.6.4 If there is a stoppage in play (whether for a wicket or injury or any other reason) during an over once a time-out has been requested pursuant to clause 11.6.5 below or the 9th or 16th over if the relevant time-out has not yet been taken, then the umpires shall, if they believe that it will speed up the game, not wait for the end of the over and may immediately call the time-out.11.6.5 Each time-out should be called by only either (a) the captain of either team or (b) the batsmen at the wicket (as appropriate in accordance with clause 11.6.3 (a) and (b) respectively) notifying one of the two on field umpires or the fourth umpire, in each case before the bowler starts his run up to deliver the final ball. Any notification once the bowler has started his run up or if he has no run up, his bowling action will not be valid and the captain will be asked if he wants the time out to take place after the end of the following over. If either the fielding captain or the batsmen respectively does not make an election, the umpires will call the time-out at the end of the 9th and 16th over respectively. For the sake of clarity, no other team representative is permitted to advise or request a time-out other than the captains of either team or batsmen at the wicket.11.6.6 The umpires will clearly signal the time-out by tapping a raised wrist (left or right).
11.6.7 In any match which is interrupted (such that the scheduled number of overs in respect thereof is less than 20) then the time-outs will occur as follows:
Scheduled Number of Overs
Earliest Fielder Time out
(End of over)
Latest Fielder Time out
(End of over)
Earliest Batsmen Time out
(End of over)

For delayed or interrupted matches where an innings is scheduled to be less than 20 overs, the maximum time of 90 minutes shall be reduced by 4 minutes 15 seconds for every over by which the innings is reduced.12.7.2 The actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of each innings by the umpires.12.7.3 In calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances shall be given as follows:12.7.3.1 The time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on the field of play;12.7.3.2 The time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious injury;12.7.3.3 The time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews;12.7.3.4 The time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and12.7.3.5 The time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side.12.7.4 In the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause12.7.3.4above (time wasting by batting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting team in the determination of its over rate.The fourth umpire should ensure that the batting captain (if not at the wicket) and the team manager are both aware of any warnings. 12.7.5 In addition to the allowances as provided for above,12.7.5.1 in the case of an innings that has been reduced due to any delay or interruption in play, an additional allowance of 1 minute for every full 3 overs by which the innings is reduced will be granted.12.7.5.2 an additional allowance of 1 minute will be given for each of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th wickets taken during an innings, except if there is a stoppage in play pursuant to 11.6.412.7.6 If a batting team is bowled outwithin the time determined for that innings pursuant to these playing conditions (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above), the fielding side shall be deemed to have complied with the required minimum over rate.
