WADA issues revised 2021 International Standard for the Protection of Privacy and Personal Information
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is pleased to publish the revised 2021 International Standard for the Protection of Privacy and Personal Information (ISPPPI), which was approved by WADA’s Executive Committee (ExCo) during its 14-15 September 2020 meeting and enters into force on 1 January 2021.
Similar to the 2021 World Anti-Doping Code and other International Standards that enter into force at the same time, the ISPPPI was subject of a three-phase consultation process that resulted in all being approved by the Agency’s Foundation Board and ExCo, respectively, during WADA’s World Conference on Doping in Sport held in November 2019. Then, on 2 June 2020, WADA launched and communicated a limited supplementary consultation phase for the ISPPPI alone that ended on 2 July.
The revised 2021 ISPPPI contains updates to Articles 4.1, 4.5, 5.3, 11.5 and Annex A. The updates integrate feedback from the 18 comments received during the supplementary consultation phase from six stakeholders, as well as observations from the European Data Protection Board provided to WADA by the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 1 November 2019.
A full summary of these changes can be found on WADA’s website.
WADA thanks all contributors for their valuable feedback.
