Certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device;
Your Internet service provider; and
Depending on your permissions, content you have stored on your device (e.g. contacts stored on your phone).
Location information. This information may include specific location information drawn from your device's GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals, including information about nearby WiFi networks, location beacons, and cell towers. We receive this information when you use location-enabled services that we offer, and also when you use certain location-based informational, marketing, or public service applications that we or other parties offer.
Information from third-party sources. We may receive additional information about you from the NHL and our business partners, as well as receive information about you that is publicly or commercially available, and we may combine that with the information we have collected or received about you in other ways. Also, we receive information about you when you choose to connect with social networking services while using our Services.
How We Use the Information We Collect or Receive. We use the information we collect and receive for the following purposes:
To provide our Services. We use the information we collect or receive to provide you with the Services you use or request. For example, we use this information to:
Create accounts;
Process transactions;
Provide technical support and respond to user inquiries;
Send you electronic and other marketing communications that may be tailored to your preferences and interests;
Administer your participation in our contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions;
Notify you about updates to our Services or send other communications that are relevant to your use of our Services; and
Enhance our ability to detect and prevent fraud and potentially illegal activities in connection with our Services and otherwise enforce our Terms of Service.
To improve our operation and Services. We also use the information we collect or receive to provide content you may find relevant and interesting and to maintain and upgrade our operations and our Services. For example, we may use this information to:
Solicit input and feedback about our Services;
Identify and address technical issues on our Services; and
Customize your experiences based on location information or your online activities, including the content you view, the products you bid on or purchase, other Services of ours you use, and other information we collect or receive.
To provide effective advertising and marketing. We also use the information we collect and receive to provide ads for our Services and certain third-party services and to send you promotional communications. For example, we may use this information:
To show you ads (on and off our Services, including on third-party social media services) based on location information or your online activities, including the content you view, the products you bid on or purchase, the other Services of ours that you use, and other information we collect or receive.
To send you electronic and other marketing messages about the Carolina Hurricanes or other third-party business partners that may be tailored to your preferences and interests.
We also may use the information we collect and receive for other purposes that may be described to you at the point of collection or for which you provide your consent.
How We Share the Information We Collect or Receive. We may share information that we collect or receive with third parties when we have your consent or as described below. We may share information with the following types of third parties:
Our affiliates. We may share information with the NHL and current and future "affiliates", a term that includes our parent and subsidiary companies, joint venture partners, or other companies we control, are controlled by, or with which we are under common control.
Our service providers. We may provide information about you to service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (for example, hosting our Services, storing our data, fulfilling orders, providing products and services, managing databases, performing analyses, administering our contests and sweepstakes, collecting location data, providing location-based services, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, or sending communications for us). These companies are contractually limited in the ways in which they may use this information.
Operational partners. We partner with third parties to operate certain of our Services. From time to time, in accordance with applicable laws, we may provide information about you to these operational partners to use for their own purposes. For example, we partner with MLB Advanced Media, L.P. ("MLBAM") to operate certain Services, and we therefore may share information about you with MLBAM, its successors and permitted assigns, and their affiliates in connection with the operation of our Services and where it is otherwise permitted by applicable law. While these operational partners may use information about you to operate the Services, you should presume that these operational partners may use your information for their own purposes in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
Business partners. With your consent, we may share information about you with other select business partners that are not service providers, such as our sponsors, other retailers, and broadcast partners, so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. These other business partners are expected to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.
Other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect us or our Services. We or our service providers may disclose your information -- including the contents of your communications -- to other parties when required or permitted by applicable law, such as when we have a good faith belief that:
Doing so is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person or persons; or
Doing so is necessary to protect our rights or property or to enforce our Terms of Service.
Other parties in connection with certain business transactions. In the event that the ownership of the Carolina Hurricanes (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another entity. If such a transaction occurs, we will notify you in an update to this Privacy Policy or through another appropriate means.
Interactive features. We may share information with third parties when you post information to a public user profile or a public area of our Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool. If you post information to these interactive features, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.
We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated information.
Third Parties That Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality On Our Services. Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include, for example:
Content providers, which may operate contests, sweepstakes, or public forums on our Services;
Retail and other companies (such as those that operate Auction Services and those that operate other Services), which may process transactions, provide customer service, and perform other related functions;
Advertising providers, which help us and our advertisers provide ads (on our Services or elsewhere online) that are tailored to users' interests and understand users' response to those ads;
Audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services; and
Social networking services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+), which enable you to log in to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.
Mobile location analytics providers, which use location-specific data to facilitate the transmission of informational, marketing, and public service communications to you.
These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services, including, for example, to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off our websites. Social networking services may be able to collect information about you, even if you do not click on or interact with their content on our Services or have an account with the social networking service. Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising from participating companies, please visit the websites of the Network Advertising Intiative, Digital Advertising Alliance, and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada. The third party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your friends and other contacts on those social networking services. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, but the main purpose for our use is to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services. For example, we might show you content that is popular among your friends or connections on a social networking service or provide you with a snapshot of the responses of your friends and other connections to that content. You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
"Do Not Track" Signals. Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites and online services should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.
Your Choices. You have a number of choices about how we handle information we collect or receive about you.

You may opt out of receiving future promotional email communications from us by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of promotional email communications and updating your preferences or by sending an email to webmaster@carolinahurricanes.com.

Location Information. If you use location-enabled services or applications covered by this privacy policy, you may be provided with an opportunity to opt out of having your location information collected and/or used for certain purposes.

You also may able to limit the collection of your location information through the settings on your device.
Security. We have adopted physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to help protect against theft, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information we collect and receive. However, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information, or any other disclosures out of our control. Your online access to some of your information may be protected with a password that you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls, or email messages).
Children's Privacy. Our Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
Third Party Links. Our Services may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. Also, links to our Services may be featured on third party services on which we advertise. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent.

The linked services should have separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such services, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the entities that operate such linked services may collect, use, disclose, secure, or otherwise treat your information.
