If you provide personal information when you use any of these features, that personal information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by a third party.  We may use third parties to provide products, services and information to you.  These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.
In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information you give us online with other information from the Company's sources, transactions and communications.
