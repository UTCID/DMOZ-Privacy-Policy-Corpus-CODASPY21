Welcome to the Davis Mansion Dining Room!
Morven Park's Davis Mansion is filled with spectacular furnishings, but many visitors love admiring our spotless silver collection, all original to the Davis and Inman families. Here's an up close look at a few of our favorites!
Here's a special look at two very unique pieces in the Dining room-- a Japanese screen and an Italian china cabinet.
In this video we invite you into the Dining Room of the Davis Mansion where the table is set for a big breakfast. Porridge or oatmeal with fruit on top would have been a treat!
