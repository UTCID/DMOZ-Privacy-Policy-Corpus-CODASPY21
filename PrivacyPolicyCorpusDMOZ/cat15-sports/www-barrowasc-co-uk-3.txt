Swimmer Squad movement.
Prior to any squad movement the lead coach must forward the club secretary a full list of swimmers who have been proposed to produce a movement letter to inform parents of the date of trial etc.
On receipt of a request to produce squad movement letters to the club secretary, the club secretary will liaise with the treasurer to check for outstanding fees.
If the swimmer has outstanding squad fees and if the treasurer has already notified the parent of an outstanding balance, the secretary is to deny the squad movement.
The treasurer or secretary must not reveal the outstanding amount to coaching staff but may inform the committee of the request.
