At the time when Housekeeping services are provided, the housekeepers will not service the room/suite if the dog is left unattended.5. When the dog is out of the room/suite and on property, the dog is required to be on a leash and under the control of the handler.6. In the event the dog damages, soils/stains fabric or carpet beyond normal cleaning, additional charges will be assessed.7. Dog Relief Areas may be provided for the guest convenience.
If not, guests are expected to take their dogs outside of the property’s public areas for any relief. Dogs will not be permitted in any guest public areas for relief.8. The handler is required to pick up and properly dispose of any dog deposits in the dog relief area.9. It is the guest’s responsibility to confirm with the Front Desk as to the locations outside of the guest’s room/suite where the dog is permitted. A dog is not allowed in public areas, including but not limited to: restaurants, spa/salon, pool areas, showrooms, convention spaces, casino, and/or common retail spaces.10.

For the safety of all guests, these breeds are not allowed on property.
Dog breeds may include, but are not limited to: Great Dane, Sharpei, Pit Bull, Rottweiler, German Shepherd, Husky, Alaskan Malamute, Doberman Pinscher, Chow Chow and Presa Canario (other dog breeds at discretion of Management). Any dog, regardless of breed, that shows aggression will be asked to be removed from the property.11. A dog will not be permitted to disturb other guests. Aggressive behavior, even for breeds not listed in Section 10, will not be permitted to stay on property. Excessive barking will result in the owner of the pet needing to find proper accommodations for their dog, not on Westgate premises.12. Any restrictions set forth herein including limitations on size, breed or amount of dogs an individual can have or a location where a dog can be present with its owner or handler referenced herein only apply to pets and not service animals.Service Animals1. Dogs and certain miniature horses (height 24-34 inches, weight between 70 & 100 pounds) are eligible to be recognized as service animals under Titles II and III of the ADA.2. A service animal is a dog or a miniature horse that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are visually impaired, alerting people who have hearing loss or are considered deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting or protecting a person having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties.
Service animals are working animals, not pets.
The work or task a service animal has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Animals whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support may not qualify as service animals under the ADA.3. Generally, Title II and Title III entities must permit service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas where members of the public are normally allowed to go. For example, in the hotel it would be inappropriate to exclude a service animal from common areas such as dining rooms.
However, it may be appropriate to exclude a service animal from kitchen areas where the animal’s presence may compromise a sanitary environment for food preparation.4. Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.5. When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Team members may ask two questions: (a) is the dog/miniature horse a service animal required because of a disability? and (b) what work or task has the dog/miniature horse been trained to perform?6. A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove the service animal from property unless: (a) the service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, (b) when it is determined that the animal’s behavior poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, or (c) the service animal is not housebroken.7. The mandatory cleaning fee is waived for service animals. Damage caused by a person with a disability or their service animal will be charged according to the hotel’s standard procedures.8. Team Members are not required to provide care or food for a service animal.Weapons Policy: Resort premises are private property.
