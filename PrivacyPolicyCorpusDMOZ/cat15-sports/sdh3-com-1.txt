Privacy Policy
Privacy Notice: When you interact with the run start calendar, we gather and record certain information about you,
such as your IP address, your internet service provider, and your sexual orientation. Normally we are too busy drinking beer
to even look at this stuff, but if you f*ck with the run start calendar, we will be able to figure out who you are.
A lot of people (OK, hashers, not people) rely on this information. Please don't ruin their day.
