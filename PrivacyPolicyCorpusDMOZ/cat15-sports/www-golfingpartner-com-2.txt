Iron Out Your Faults
Some of my happy clients
Ian inspired me to play golf when I was 12 years old
and he is still inspiring me now 12 years later and I'm now a 1 handicap golfer.
Thanks Ian
- Jonny Golding, Amateur Golfer
Been working with Ian ever since I started playing 5 years ago. Together weve got my handicap down from 36 - 5.
I look forward to working with him for the rest of my golfing journey and definitely recommend to golfers of all abilities.
Thanks for everything so far coach.
- George Halfpenny, Amateur Golfer
I first went to Ian on a recommendation and from the beginning I found him to be articulate and very understanding. He gradually sorted out my swing and I suppose my golfing brain.
Every so often I go and seek advice and that proverbial arm around my shoulder, and within a few shots I am back thinking I can play golf.
I would thoroughly recommend Ian, and suggest you try his new golfing website.
- Steve Garfield, Amateur Golfer
Ian is the reason I won the Club Championship and got down to Scratch. I spent too many years researching and applying Youtube videos which gave no success and made my game stagnate consequently golf become far less enjoyable.
His unique teaching style cleared my mind on the course helping me play the game properly and with freedom. Ian removes the shackles from your game whereas sadly many pros make them tighter. Highly recommended for all golfers and of all abilities. Thanks Ian.
- Tom Sherwin, Amateur Golfer
Ians approach is to work on the golf swing from the ground up by applying fundamental positions to create a foundation to swing from.
I was a mid 20s handicapper who might have the odd fluky round but struggled for consistency most of the time. Through following Ians coaching philosophy I've now reduced my handicap to 18 and have a good understanding of my golf swing but more importantly what a good golf swing feels like.
I would recommend Ian to anybody, hes a top coach!
- Martin Cobb, Amateur Golfer
Ian has been coaching our twelve year old son for 18 months. Ians methods and principles are simple and easy to understand and practice with very little technical instruction.
Our son has responded to this approach in a hugely positive way and enjoys his sessions with Ian immensely. This has led to a massive improvement in his golf which last season produced a handicap reduction of almost ten shots to 23 and the competition success that goes with it.
- Mark & Leona Harris, Amateur Golfer
Ian has been working with Frazer for the last 3 years since Frazer was 10 years old. Frazer has improved his swing , course management, balance and alignment and golfing brain , with advice and introducing routines and drills that when practiced regularly and properly the results speak for themselves, Frazers recent achievements :
Under 14s & Under 16s Leicestershire champion
2018 Midlands Golf Union Champion of Champions winner
2018 Under 14s County captain
Handicap reduced from 22 to 5
Representing U14, U16 & U81s at County level
England Boys U16's Regional Training Squad
Ians approach is to work on golf basics in an easy and straightforward way. Ian has a natural ability and passion for golf coaching which offers support and guidance to help deliver goals and self-belief which is inspiring.
Andy & Nora Jones
- Frazer Jones, Amateur Golfer
Ian, thank you for all your help so far. My golf has vastly improved. The last two round being 71(+1) and 67(-3) today, the putting lesson has made the real difference!
Again thank you and see you soon. Tom
- Tom Flavell, Amateur Golfer
I have known Ian for a number of years now, not only is he a great friend but he is a brilliant instructor and aspires to help you to achieve the best you can possibly be. I love his outlook on golf and how he looks at the technicalities as opposed to digital animated graphics when teaching.
He was extremely patient and understanding with me especially as I am on the Autism spectrum so sometimes misinterpret information.
I have no hesitation in recommending Ian and his services a well deserved 5 star rating!
- Dan Foster, Amateur Golfer
Ian is an end-to-end golf coach. He will teach you all aspects of the game, building consistency and confidence that will positively influence every shot you make!
Waste your time and money on twenty minute short term swing fixes down the local range if you wish. But if you're serious on improving your golf and playing your best possible game, spend some time with Ian.
- Mark Goodge, Amateur Golfer
I've been working with Ian for over 3yrs now and I'd recommend him to all without question!
His explanation is always simple and easily understood that he backs up with some fantastic swing drills designed to create feel in the swing to match up with his explanation. He's also given me some awesome skills testing and fun packed practice games that have helped me to love me practice again resulting in me reducing my h'cap from 23 to 8 so far.
Thanks Ian, you are a credit to your coaching profession :)
- Mitchell Garner, Amateur Golfer
Wow awesome Ian
Just to let you know I took one of your online lessons last week and with the practice drills you've provided I've already seen a big improvement in my ball striking. Thank you Ian I'll definitely be back for more !!
- Benji Rogers, Amateur Golfer
