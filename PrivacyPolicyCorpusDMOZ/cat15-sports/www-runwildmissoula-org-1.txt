Run Wild Missoula respects the privacy of all users who visit this site. No effort is made to identify individuals without their prior knowledge and approval. The following policies are in effect for all of the web pages owned and operated by us:
PERSONAL INFORMATION: On some of our input forms we ask users to provide their name, e-mail address, and/or other information for the intended purpose of the form. Whenever the identity of a visitor is requested, we clearly indicate the purpose of the request and the information is only used for the stated purpose of the form. Your personal information, including your e-mail address, will never be sold to a third party.
MAILING LISTS: If you voluntarily sign up for any of our mailing lists your email address or street address will only be used for this purpose and will never be given or sold to any third parties. This site maintains a strict "no-spam" policy and only sends email to those who have specifically asked us to do so. You may easily be removed from our list at any time by using our contact form.
LOG FILES: When a visitor views any of our pages, like all web servers, our system logs the visitor's IP address. We collect the IP address in order to compile information on what pages visitors successfully access, and what pages they may have experienced any technical difficulties with.

MEMBER RECORDS: Member records are never sold to third parties and are only viewed by Run Wild Missoula staff when necessary.
SECURE TRANSACTIONS: This site uses a secure SSL server so information submitted by you in secure mode is encrypted for your privacy. This means no other party can view personal information while in transit over the Internet. Credit card transactions are completely safe using this technology.

TESTIMONIALS
"[The Missoula Marathon] gets better every year and I get to watch the progress. There is a certain amount of ownership, pride and boasting privilege one has when their community hosts a really exciting event. Missoula is my home by choice and events like this reinforce my decision."- Cynthia Wood, 48
