We are strongly committed to your right to privacy and to
providing a safe, enjoyable and productive user experience on-line.
Our Privacy Policy has been drawn up with those aims in mind. We
reserve the right to modify or amend this Policy at any time and will
display the effective date at the end of this statement. By submitting
your personal information to us you agree to our use of such
information as set out below.
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data

Personally Identifiable Information
Collection and storage
We only collect personally identifiable information, such
as name, address and golfing profile that you specifically and
voluntarily provide to us as a visitor to our website, for example, to
register for certain areas of the website, to seek further information
from our sales team, to make a booking for a golf break, to enter a
competition, to register for events, or to subscribe to our email
newsletter.
Personally identifiable information submitted by you will
be collected, stored on our customer information database. All
information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any
payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or
where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain
parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password
confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

We will use your personally identifiable information to
service your request (and any similar future requests). See the Data
Protection section (clause 17) of our Booking Conditions for details
of how we use your personally identifiable information in order to
process your booking. We endeavour to keep an accurate record of the
information collected. We will retain it as long as necessary to
service your current request and any similar future requests (such as
repeat bookings), or until you request that we delete the information.
Where you have consented to do so, we may also use your
personally identifiable information to keep you informed about our
services by means of our e-mail newsletter or other electronic

included in a booking for a golf break, you must ensure that you have
the authority of those third parties to provide their information to
us for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, and by submitting
such information on their behalf you confirm that you have their
consent.
