Revellers at the University of Manchester were caught on Snapchat defying the Government's 'Rule of Six' and dancing outside halls of residence at the illegal party, reports the MEN. The clips, which were taken at 1am on Friday morning, show a huge gathering outside Owens Park halls in Fallowfield, south Manchester. It came just hours before 1,700 students were placed into lockdown at the nearby Manchester Metropolitan University. The students were told to self-isolate for 14 days 'with immediate effect' after a surge in Covid cases. Another clip shows a sea of people dancing to music which appears to be coming from a sound system that had been set up.
Both videos were geotagged to the Owens Park campus off Wilmslow Road. A spokesperson from the University of Manchester said the university 'strongly condemns' the behaviour of the students. They said details of the offending students are being recorded. A number of those captured in the footage will now go through a disciplinary process, they added. More security officers have now been deployed at the Fallowfield campus.

In a full, the statement from the university spokesperson said: “We are aware of this party and our security services worked with Greater Manchester Police to shut it down. "This behaviour is totally unacceptable and the University strongly condemns it. "We have been clear and consistent with our messaging around student conduct and behaviour in halls and we will be working hard to identify those involved. “Our students must respect social distancing rules and all other restrictions to keep themselves and others safe.
"If students do not comply, they will face disciplinary action from the University, which could lead to fines or expulsion, and we will not hesitate to involve the police if necessary. "Some students have already been issued with fixed penalty notices by the police. “Additional security officers have been deployed in Fallowfield and further reminders sent. "Details of offending students are being recorded and a number of these will now go through our disciplinary process.”somersetliveFollow @somersetliveMore Ontendendo
