Terms and Conditions for Samoset Resort Reservations
A credit card is required to book hotel reservations and will be charged for the first night's room and tax up to seven days prior to your arrival. If you wish to cancel, please do so seven days prior to arrival to avoid cancellation penalties. Should you cancel reservations within seven days of arrival date, one night’s room and tax will be charged to your credit card. In the event you do not arrive on the confirmed arrival date, your reservation will be canceled and one night’s room and tax will be charged to your credit card.
At check-in, the front desk will verify your check-out date. Rates quoted are based on check-in date and length of stay. Should you choose to depart early, price is subject to change. We reserve the right to cancel or modify reservations where it appears that a customer has engaged in fraudulent or inappropriate activity or under other circumstances where it appears that the reservations contain or resulted from a mistake or error.
