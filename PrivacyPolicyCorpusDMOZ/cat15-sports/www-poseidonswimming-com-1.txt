Poseidon Swim School Lesson Policies
Policies related to SWIMMER AND PARENT CONDUCT
Parents must determine a child's readiness for swim lessons. Poseidon accepts children aged three and up who are potty trained (no swim diapers allowed).
Proper swim attire is required during swim lessons. Girls must wear a one-piece bathing suit. Long hair must be secured in a ponytail or swim cap. Goggles are permitted from Level 2 and up (no goggles in preschool or Level 1). Goggles must not cover the swimmer's nose.
Persons participating in the Program, and up to 2 guests per participant, may enter the Indoor Pool facility during the Use Period.  AFC staff may allow additional guests in their discretion. Guests may observe Program activities but may not otherwise use the Indoor Pool or other WSRC facilities.
All rules and policies of the AFC will be followed by all persons who are at or using the Indoor Pool as part of the Program.
Parents must remain on the bleachers beside the pool during lessons.
If a swimmer needs assistance using the bathroom during class, you may assist your child and then return them to class.
School-aged children are not permitted in the locker room or bathroom of the opposite gender. Please bring your child ready to swim; changing clothing on deck is not allowed.
Non-member students are not allowed to enter the pool before class or stay in the pool after dismissed.
Parents are responsible for notifying Poseidon of any relevant medical circumstances, behavior issues, or water experiences before the first class begins.
A parent or guardian must remain at the Poseidon facility during the duration of the swim lesson.
Photos may be taken during lessons for marketing and promotional uses. You must notify us in writing if you do not want your child's photo used.
Poseidon has the right to terminate the participation of a student in the Poseidon Swim School, for any reason, at any time.
Policies related to CLASS REGISTRATION AND PAYMENT
Class selection and registration is done online or through the Poseidon Swim School office, either in person or by calling 804-739-3454, ext 7000.
You must pay in full to reserve a spot in a lessons class. Space is reserved for your child ONLY when payment is received. We accept checks (payable to Poseidon Swimming) or credit cards and bank drafts only; we do not accept cash.
You may enroll in as many sessions as are offered each season. In the case that a different level is recommended by the instructor than what was registered for, we will move the swimmer to the appropriate level.
Students do not necessarily move up a level after each session. The instructor will determine your swimmer's readiness to move to the next level. Progress reports will be given on the last day of class. It is customary for many students to remain in one level for multiple sessions; our staff believes each child progresses at his or her own pace and it is neither appropriate nor beneficial to place a child in a level above their capability.
Policies related to CANCELLATIONS, REFUNDS, CREDITS AND MAKE UP CLASSES
No refunds or credits will be given if you cancel within 5 days of the class start date. No refunds or credits are offered after a session begins, as instructors are hired based on registration.
Refunds, credits, or make up classes are not offered for conflicts with other activities or vacations. Credits will be issued ONLY for extended illness (3 or more consecutive lessons missed) with a doctor's note.
Weather related cancellations are based on Woodlake Aquatic and Fitness Center’s inclement weather policy, which is 30 minutes out of the water in the event of thunder. Lessons may be stopped, but then continued when the conditions permit. Weather-related cancellations will be posted on the Poseidon website.
If a class is cancelled due to low participation (less than 3 swimmers), and a substitute replacement is not found, you will be offered a refund or credit.
Credits are valid for one year and may be applied to future lessons sessions.
