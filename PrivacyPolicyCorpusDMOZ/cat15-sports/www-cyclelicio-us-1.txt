Cyclelicious and your privacy
Tracking
I don't directly track your presence on this website. Your IP
address is logged and I look at the server logs on occasion,
but this is in an aggregate fashion for the purpose of determining
why people come to Cyclelicio.us. What I'm most interested in specifically
are two things: The websites that link to Cyclelicious and send traffic
here, and what keywords people use to find Cyclelicious via search engines
such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN.
Links and comments
If you leave a link in a comment, I'll
probably follow the link, even if the link is a Blogger.com profile. I'm
assuming you want me to find you if you make your contact information
easily findable.
Cookies
I don't directly set cookies from Cyclelicio.us, but I do run a number
of scripts from providers such as Google, Haloscan, and Blogger. All
of these set web browser cookies. Google in particular quietly collects a
tremendous amount of data on your browsing habits, and Cyclelicious
participates in that data collection. If that bugs you, please
drop me a line to let me
know how you feel about this and I'll consider removing Google's
service.
