FANY Privacy Policy:
The Great Big FANY Ride, LLC does not sell our list of riders, nor do we share it, give it away, or trade it with any business or anybody.  Period.  End of story.  Nobody on this
earth needs to know what size T-shirt you ordered.   Sometimes we're asked to post on our website a list of registered riders,  but we feel that's a violation of riders privacy;
the kind of thing that could play havoc with a witness protection program or whatever you told your boss you were doing during FANY week.  So we just don't do it.
At the very bottom of this page, there's a link to the Privacy Policy of our hosting company.
