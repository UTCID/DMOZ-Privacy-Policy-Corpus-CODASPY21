Morsy joined Middlesbrough earlier this summer, signing a three-year contract on Teesside. And speaking about the midfielder, assistant manager Kevin Blackwell has revealed that during their scouting of the Egyptian international, they sought the advice of Reid, who managed Sunderland to two consecutive seventh-placed Premier League finishes in 2000 and 2001. Blackwell knows Reid well, having served as his assistant manager at Leeds United previously, while Reid knew Morsy well having worked on Paul Cook's Wigan backroom team from 2018. "I’m excited for Sam because everyone we spoke to has rated him highly. Personally I spoke to Peter Reid who had him at Wigan and he really couldn’t have been more complimentary of him. “I take that a lot from Reidy because he was a dogmatic midfield player in the mould of Sam Morsy.” The 29-year-old awaits his first league start for Boro. He came off the bench for a two-minute cameo against Bournemouth at the weekend to help see the game out. That followed a good 70-minute run out in the cup game against Barnsley. And Blackwell revealed they're just helping to ease the midfielder in at the club before throwing him into the team.

Asked if he believed he could play in the same midfield as defence-minded Jonny Howson, Blackwell said: "I do think they can play together those two. "I think the energy from both of them will be a real base to work from. “We’re looking forward to seeing Sam, that’s why he got 70 minutes the other night and he just needs some more training."TeessideGazetteFollow @GazetteBoroMore OnMiddlesbrough FCSunderland AFCWigan Athletic FCMiddlesbrough FC Transfer News
