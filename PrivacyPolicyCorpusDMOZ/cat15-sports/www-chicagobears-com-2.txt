Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
(b) These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The parties agree that any claim or dispute one party has against the other party arising under or relating to these Terms (including claims in contract, tort, strict liability, statutory liability, or other claims) that is not resolved under Section 14 of these Terms must be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction, federal or state, located in Cook or Lake County Illinois, and no other court. Each party agrees to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and to accept service of process from them.
(c) It is the Company's goal that the Services meet your expectations. However, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, the Company is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with the Company, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give the Company an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute using the following email address:
Fan.Services-CHI@Bears.nfl.net or mailing address:
1920 Football Dr.
Lake Forest, IL 60047.
With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), you and the Company agree to negotiate in good faith to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution. If you and the Company do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.
ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR THE NFL WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
All disputes arising under this Agreement that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that the Company may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Illinois necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive the right to bring any claim in any forum unless you provide the Company with written notice of the events or facts giving rise to the claim within one (1) year of their occurrence.
16. Severability; Interpretation
If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions shall not be affected. All interpretations of these Terms will be at the Company's sole discretion and the Company's decisions will be final. When used in these Terms, the word "including" shall be deemed followed by the words "without limitation."
17. Entire Terms
These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and other policies incorporated herein, constitute the entire and only agreement between the Company and each user of the Services with respect to the subject matter of these Terms and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.
18. Miscellaneous
The failure of the Company and its Affiliated Parties to insist upon strict adherence to any section of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that section and shall not be considered a waiver or limit the Company's right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that section of any other section in these Terms.
