THE CLUB WILL RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO MODIFY THESE CONDITIONS BY POSTING A REVISED VERSION ON THIS WEBSITE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD (AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY) THESE CONDITIONS NOW AND EVERY TIME YOU USE THE SERVICES. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SERVICES YOU ACCEPT ANY REVISED VERSION.
1. Orders
In completing the subscription application in full on the website, you are entering into a legally binding contract with Dundee United FC to purchase the Services described. The contract is conditional on payment being authorised by your card issuer and is at all times subject to these Conditions.
2. Price and Payment
Our prices only cover access to the Services. Telephone line and other communications or access costs may be charged to you separately by your ISP or relevant service provider. Except in the case of manifest error, the prices payable for the Services that you order are as set out on this website at the time at which your order is placed and or subsequently renewed. Payment must be made in £ sterling and may be made by Mastercard, Visa, Switch, Solo Visa Delta cards. You confirm that the credit/debit card which is being used is yours. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card Issuer. Dundee United FC reserves the right to refuse credit/debit card payments at its reasonable discretion. PayPal will process your payment on a secure site.
In exceptional circumstances where payment under the above cannot be made, it may be possible to pay by cheque or postal order but only in respect of annual subscriptions.
3. Duration and Termination
a) Your right to terminate.
Subscriptions are payable monthly or annually, under the payment authority advised to Paypal and will be automatically renewed unless you cancel prior to the end of the period in accordance with the cancellation conditions below. Once the contract is entered into and access to the site has been granted, cancellations can only be accepted under the following terms and refunds cannot be made unless in exceptional circumstances.
Cancellation must be made no less than 10 working days prior to the end of the month or year (depending on whether you are paying monthly or annually respectively) for which you have paid. If you cancel prior to this 10 working day period access to the Services will be terminated at the end of the relevant period. If you cancel during this working day period you will be charged for the following month, year or relevant period and access to the Services will terminate on expiry of that following month. If you cancel your Subscription after your renewal date you will be charged for the following month, year or relevant period and access to the Services will terminate on expiry of that following month, year or relevant period. Please note that the onus is upon you to cancel your payment authority with PayPal using the secure information provided by them to you at the time of join up.
b) Our right to terminate
The Club may terminate this agreement with immediate effect and by written notice at any time if you commit a material breach of this agreement (and any breach of clause 2 or 7 will be considered to be a material breach) or if you do not fulfill any of the technical requirements set out in your application.
In addition, the Club may terminate this agreement on one calendar month's notice given in writing to you in accordance with clause 5. If the Club terminates the agreement other than as a result of your breach or technical non-compliance, you will receive a refund of the amount you pre-paid for the Services less an amount proportionate to the number of days for which you have had access to the Services.
4. Cancellation
Except under clause 3, you will not be able to cancel your Subscription Contract once your subscription application has been submitted and access to the Subscription Site has been granted.
5. The Services and Service Availability
The 'Services' shall be the provision to you of access to all features of the website, including match highlights, video and audio features, archive footage and materials and forums. However, the Club reserves the right to amend the nature and extent of the Services available at any time. You will need to load your PC with Windows Media Player software (which you will need to obtain) and you will be permitted to access the Services only from this PC.
You are responsible for ensuring that you have and maintain all the hardware and software necessary to access, receive and view the Services.
In the event that the Club reasonably determines that you do not meet these requirements, it reserves the right to refuse the provision of Services to you. In such a case you will be entitled to a refund of any sums paid as provided for in clause 3b ("Our right to terminate").
The Club will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Services are made available to you at all times. However, this Website is provided on an ''as is" basis. In particular, the image and sound quality of the Services may vary, whether due to congestion on the internet or telephone lines or otherwise. The Website may not be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free.
From time to time we will need to close the Website to carry out upgrades or maintenance. We will try to keep this to a minimum. Subject to the constraints described above, the Club will carry out the Services with reasonable care and skill. Apart from this we make no representation or warranty (and exclude all warranties and conditions otherwise implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law).This does not affect any other statutory rights you may have as a consumer.
