Privacy Policy
Moonee Valley Racing Club Privacy Policy
The protection of personal information is important to Moonee Valley Racing Club Inc. (MVRC). MVRC is committed to respecting the right to privacy and the protection of personal information.
This document sets out how MVRC may collect, hold and use personal information. By providing your personal information to MVRC, you consent to its use, storage and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
What personal and sensitive information does MVRC collect?
Personal Information
Personal information is information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) from which it is possible to determine someone's identity.
The information collected by MVRC about a particular person will vary depending on the circumstances of collection. It may include, but is not limited to, a person's contact details (name, email and/or postal address, phone number, next of kin), date of birth, gender, occupation, credit card details, driver's licence number, passport number, insurance details, communication history with MVRC, attendance history at Moonee Valley Racecourse or MVRC gaming venues, details about a computer device used to acccess MVRC websites or Wi-Fi services (such as IP address, geolocation, domain name and browser type), information downloaded from a MVRC website and details of the goods and/or services purchased from MVRC.
Sensitive Information
Sensitive information is a type of personal information that also includes information or an opinion about someone's:
racial or ethnic origin;
political opinions;
membership of a political association, professional or trade association or trade union;
religious beliefs or affiliations or philosophical beliefs;
sexual preferences or practices;
criminal record; or
health, genetic information or disability.
Although unlikely, MVRC may also collect sensitive information such as a person's medical history, nationality, their ethnic background or disabilities if it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.
MVRC is required by law to obtain consent when collecting sensitive information. MVRC will assume consent to the collection of all sensitive information that is provided to it for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless told otherwise.

(a)	become a member of MVRC or a business of MVRC, including but not limited to the Junction Club, Leighoak Club and Moonee Valley Legends (MVRC Business);

Providing information
Depending on the circumstances, some types of information will be required and others might be optional. If you do not provide some or all of the information requested, this may affect MVRC's ability to communicate with you or provide the requested products or services.
By not providing requested information, you may jeopardise your ability to participate in programs or competitions or apply for employment or volunteer positions with MVRC or a MVRC Business or Affiliate. If it is impracticable for MVRC to deal with you as a result of you not providing the requested information or consent, MVRC may refuse to do so.
Collection from third parties
MVRC or a MVRC Business or Affiliate may collect personal information regarding a child from the parent or other responsible person associated with that child.
In many circumstances, MVRC collects information from MVRC Businesses or Affiliates or other third parties. Examples of such third parties could include, without limitation, Racing Australia, Racing Victoria, the Australian Jockeys Association, Australian Bookmakers Association, Office of the Racing Integrity Commissioner, sponsors, event organisers, contractors, employment agencies, first aid providers, emergency services, Victoria Police, or government and law enforcement bodies.
Information storage and protection
MVRC stores information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form.
Much of the information we collect from and about our members and customers is added to MVRC's customer relationship management database. When your information is entered into MVRC's database, the information may be combined or linked with other information held about you.
Security of personal information is important to MVRC. MVRC has taken steps to protect the information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the security measures MVRC uses include strict confidentiality requirements of our employees, volunteers, MVRC Businesses and Affiliates and service providers, network security audits, security measures for system access and security measures for our website.
We seek to protect your personal information from any unauthorised loss, disclosure or access. However, if a serious data breach occurs, we must notify you as required under the Privacy Act regarding the circumstances of the breach, and must also advise the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
How does MVRC use and disclose personal and sensitive information?
