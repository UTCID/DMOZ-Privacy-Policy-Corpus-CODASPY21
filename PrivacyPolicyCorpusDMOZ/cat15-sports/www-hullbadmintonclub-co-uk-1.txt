6. How and why do we use your personal data?
We need to use your personal data if you are one of our members / visitors/volunteers, in order to fulfil our obligations to you and provide you with our services and/or products.
We want to give you the best possible customer experience. One way to achieve that is to get the richest picture we can of who you are by combining the data we have about you into one single view.
We then use this to present news, benefits, offers, products and services that are most likely to interest you. The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our members/visitors/volunteers and providing the highest levels of service.
Of course, if you wish to change how we use your data, you will find details in the ‘What are my rights?’ section below.
Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide some services you’ve asked for.
For example, if you have asked us to let you know when YONEX All England Championships tickets go on sale, we cannot do that if you have withdrawn your general consent to hear from us. Or we are unable to advise you when a new benefit to the membership programme is launched.
7. Combining your data for personalised direct communication
We want to communicate offers, benefits, services and promotions that are most relevant to your interests at particular times. To help us form a better, overall understanding of you as a member/visitor/volunteer, we combine your personal data gathered across the various websites and databases that we operate.
For this purpose we also combine the data that we collect directly from you with data that we obtain from other sources and hold a single view of your badminton interests.

9. How long will we keep your personal data?
Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we will only keep it for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.
