We want to keep this, this town alive.When the shuttle program shut down, there were thousands of people that were laid off.The community got desolate.Sunrise was one of the few businesses to remain a constant.And through thick and thin, it's been a place where the community come together.We have a lot of homeless people.So, we feel like that's a big part of a way that we can give back to our community.Every week they participate in a ministry that feeds over a hundred individuals.We are ever so grateful that the homeless can actually come in and get homemade breads and homemade soups.You've got these business owners who do these really incredible things because they can.And it's the right thing to do.[Applause]Oh, my gosh.Why are all our people here?I walked out the door and my mind was blown.Listen, everybody around supporting us was a really great thing to see.That's not all.We're going to be covering the cost of twenty-five hundred meals for needy here in Titusville.We're so grateful to give twenty-five hundred meals.I feel like that's something that we could have never done by ourselves.So to be a part of this, our business being able to give back to our community like that is something that we can't even describe.

Community means family.I think that's what it's turned into.I'm going to cry.I don't know why.Alright, your turn to talk.Hey everybody.Sam from Bonn Place Brewing Company here, and this is my wife.I'm Gina.Bethlehem is one of the greatest steel towns in America.When manufacturing had a downturn Bethlehem had to reinvent itself.When I first met Sam and Gina, they had this dream that they wanted to accomplish.When we first signed our lease on this building, people were questioning it, like "you sure you want to open a brewery on the south side of Bethlehem in the current climate?"We were certain that it was ready for what we wanted to do.We needed a bit of help to get this place opened...and everybody needs help.When anybody ever comes to us and says, "We need help. What can we do? We don't know how to get through this red tape."We say, "This is what we did. This might help you."We even went to City Hall for someone once.This is the community we can change.What we can change is right here and right now.Sam and Gina are very passionate about working with women entrepreneurs.It's hard to start a business.One thing Sam and Gina have been able to achieve is share the lessons they've learned with other business owners and convince them, "hey, it actually is possible."We want to see businesses succeed with the opportunities that we've had.So what better way than to mentor them.We're all in this together, and it's the bigger picture.Bonn Place is a catalyst for the regrowth of this community.They're also now helping other young entrepreneurs get started.Sam and Gina sat down with us and gave us tips and tricks of what to do to get started.We had this idea.And they believe in us.How much they're committed to the growth of Bethlehem as a whole.That's the real story.
[Applause]
They are the last two people who would want this bestowed upon them, but they are the most deserving.So we all want to gather here today and say thank you, because we value everything that you put into Bethlehem.There's a little bit more.So, the contribution we made to a female entrepreneurship program, in your name.We're absolutely thrilled.Next year, with this gift, we're going to be able to serve even more women entrepreneurs.The integrity of this community is real strong.This is just the beginning.

I've seen Rachid be an inspiration.His generosity is known throughout the community.This is a tough city.It's hard, and living in this city gets harder every day.Sometimes it's difficult for some family to have food to put on the table.I was raised... to give.My father teached me that.And I decide that one day I would open my own place.And take care of my community.Rachid, he's really all about: "It starts with us.It starts with neighborhood businesses. We can make the change in the community."Every Thanksgiving, at no cost to them, Rachid opens up his doors to the community so they could come in and have a Thanksgiving dinner.As well as every night, he donates the food to the churches in the area.We're not blind to their good work.Folks are being inspired and encouraged by it.He needed to know we see what you're doing, and we appreciate everything, and it is making a difference.The trucks' people I love... the customers, everyone was waiting for me to say thank you.So, as a thank you to Rachid, his famous Thanksgiving event that he has every year, we're going to make Thanksgiving happen in July.I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you've done and you're humble about it.And that's why we wanted to take this time.To show you that, you know, we do appreciate everything that you've done.TD bank would also like to do Thanksgiving in July.Thank you.Thanksgiving in July, in Harlem...it meant a lot to me.To wake up one day,and open the door,and feed most of the people.That's something very amazing that happened to me today.
