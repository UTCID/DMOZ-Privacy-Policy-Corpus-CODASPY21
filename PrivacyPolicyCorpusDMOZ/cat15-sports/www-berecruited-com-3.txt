Third-Party Functionality
Some of the functionality of the Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with BeRecruited.
These entities may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, Web beacons, and similar technologies.
BeRecruited is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.
Top
Protection of Information
We use reasonable physical and technical measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.
Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask that you not share your password with anyone.
Top
Children’s Information
The Services are neither intended for nor directed at children younger than 13 years of age.
We do not knowingly collect or store personal information about children under the age of 13.
Top
Non-U.S. Users
The Services are intended for a U.S. audience.
If you access the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be processed and transferred to the United States and be subject to U.S. law.
The privacy and data protection laws in the United States may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence.
By using our website, participating in any of the Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States and in accordance with U.S. law.
Top
Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information
We wish to maintain accurate personal information.
If you have submitted personal information through the Services and set-up an account, then you can (i) access and update your personal information by logging into your online account and making the appropriate changes or (ii) delete your account by emailing us at privacy@berecruited.com.
Please note that if you delete your account, we may continue to retain your information on our servers for archival purposes.
If you have forgotten your login credentials, you can retrieve those via our automated password retrieval system.
Top
Targeted Advertising
In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests.
These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant.
Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
and
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action.
Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies.
Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads.
In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement.
Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
BeRecruited — as well as certain third parties that provide content and other functionality on the Services—may use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services and the Internet.
This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.
Cookies.
Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers.
For example, cookies can be used to store your sign-in credentials so that you do not have to enter them each time you return to a website.
Cookies also may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website.
You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
BeRecruited and the third parties that provide content or functionality on the Services may use cookies to:
Collect information about your browsing activities in order to provide you with more relevant content and ads off the Services; and
Relate the information automatically collected when you use the Services to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources.
Other local storage.
We, along with third-party partners, may use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
These objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies, however.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
Web beacons.
We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.
We and our partners use Web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

You may request such removal by emailing us at privacy@berecruited.com.
Please note that your request does not ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of the material.
Top
Do Not Track Signal
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
We do not currently take action in response to those signals.
If an industry standard on responding to such signals is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to those signals.
Top
Links to Other Websites
Our Services may contain links or references to third-party owned and/or operated websites that we believe might be of interest to users, including websites of our partners, sponsors, advertisers, and affiliates.
We do not control the content of these third-party websites.
These third-party websites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information.
Once you have clicked on a link to a third-party website and leave our Services, you must read the privacy policy of the third-party website to see how your personal information will be handled.
Top
Changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the scope of the Services or for other reasons.
Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted here each time you use the Services.
If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will email you at the email address you have provided or will place a notice on our Services.
By continuing to use the Services after we make changes, you indicate your consent to those changes.
