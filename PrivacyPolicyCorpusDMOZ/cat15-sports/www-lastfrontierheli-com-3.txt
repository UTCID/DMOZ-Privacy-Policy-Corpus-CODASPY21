Weather Report Reviewed / Updated: September 16, 20202021 Updated Booking Policy Our team has put their heads together and run multiple operating scenarios for the leadup to next winter. In order to make planning easier for you [and more challenging for us!] we have decided to relax our 2021 booking policy as follows:Seat Holds Based on availability, seats can be held without a deposit until a predetermined date.Deposit Payments Depending on when your trip was booked, the following deposit conditions apply:Between 2-APR and 31-OCT-2020: Fully refundable until 31-OCT-2020. No questions asked. After 31-OCT-2020: Non-refundable.Balance Payments Balance payments are due 60 days before your trip start date [2021 season only].Should you have to cancel your 2021 heliski trip to comply with COVID related border, travel or quarantine restrictions* after your balance payment has been made, you have the following two options:Move your entire payment to the 2022 season and maintain 2020 pricing for your new booking. Move your deposit to the 2022 [or 2023] season and receive a refund of your balance payment. Your 2022 [or 2023] balance is then due 90 days prior to your new trip start date and subject to our annual price increases.The same options apply if Last Frontier has to cancel the 2021 season to comply with COVID related border, travel or operational restrictions (for example but not limited to: physical distancing, quarantine advisory).Private Tours A deposit of 20% of the tour price is required at the time of booking and a total of 50% of the tour price is due 120 days prior to the trip. The full balance is due 60 days before the trip start date. These payment conditions apply to the 2021 season only and are subject to the above COVID cancellation policies.
