How Refunds Are Calculated
The amount of your refund depends on several factors:
Items that meet our returns guidelines will receive a full refund less the shipping costs.
If you used a gift certificate to pay for all or part of an item you want to return, that part of your refund will be credited to your account for use on a future purchase.
If you return an order that was placed using a promotional certificate or discount, you will not be refunded for the amount of the promotional offer, as these discounts were deducted from the original purchase amount. If approved for return, orders are subject to a 15% restocking fee if not within our guidelines (past 30 days, not in manufacturer packing, etc).
Production companies for Dance, TV, etc: Returns are not allowed if the products have been used for production or a photo shoot. If approved as unused there will be a 25% restocking fee for these.
