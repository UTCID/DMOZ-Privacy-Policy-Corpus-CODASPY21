4. Our goods
4.1          The images of the goods on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer's display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the goods. The colour of your goods may vary slightly from those images.
4.2          The packaging of your goods may vary from that shown on images on our site.
4.3          We reserve the right to amend the specification of the goods if required by any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement.

To prevent these errors from happening, please review your order carefully before submitting.

6. Item Specific Guidance
6.1          When trying on goods, you must abide by the following guidance. In the event that you ignore the guidance and damage to the goods results, we will consider you in breach of your statutory duty to take reasonable care of the goods and may take steps to recover our losses from you.
6.2          Please take particular care with items which are easily damaged. If you need further guidance on the best way to try any item without damaging it, please contact us. When trying on goods it should be reasonably apparent before fully trying on the goods whether they are likely to fit or not and you should not stretch goods or force zips or fastenings as this may damage the goods.
6.3          Wellington Boots:
When trying on boots they should only be worn indoors.
6.4          Riding Hats:
We reserve the right to refuse the refund of a riding hat if the helmet shows signs of wear and tear or is badly packaged. To ensure that we accept the riding hat, handle it carefully, and package the helmet for return as well as we packaged it for delivery.
6.5          Garments:
When trying on garments of clothing for size and fit this should only be carried out indoors and reasonable care should be taken to avoid damage to the garments. Please avoid forcing items.
6.6          Zips and Buttons:
When fastening zips or buttons on any of the goods supplied please do not force these.
7. Returns and Exchanges
Cancellation Rights & Returns - UK and EU
7.1          If you live in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA), you have a legal right to cancel your order after you have received and inspected the goods. Please note than in the case of clothes and accessories, "inspect" means examine, and does not permit you to use the items. Please see our item specific guidance above.
7.2          Please note that you are under a legal duty to take care of the product, and this includes all packaging and labelling. Care must be taken to ensure that the goods remain in the best possible condition.
7.3          Should you decide to return any item(s) you must do so within 30 business days of receipt of the goods.
Returns - Rest of World (Inc. USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)
7.4          The cancellation rights set out above do not apply to customers living outside of the United Kingdom or EEA.
7.5          For non-EEA customers, we hope you will be fully satisfied with our products. If for any reason you are not satisfied because they are mis-described or faulty, we will be happy to accept a return from you in accordance with the following policy.
7.6          You must contact us as soon as possible to explain your concerns and your wish to return the goods by email to contact@harryhall.com. If we reasonably agree with your concerns, we will confirm by email that you may return an item in its original condition and packaging, which must be sent to us within 7 days of us sending to you that written confirmation. On receipt of the returned item and verification that your concerns are genuine, we will issue an internet credit note or item exchange subject to our discretion. Unless we specifically agree otherwise by email, we will not grant refunds on items received more than 14 days after we email you to confirm your return.
7.7          We do not refund shipping charges.
8. Returns Do's and Don'ts - All Countries
8.1          We recommend that you obtain proof of postage and proof of delivery, as we cannot be held responsible for it being lost or damaged before it arrives to us.
8.2          If at all possible, please include with the goods a copy of your invoice and return note, or a written note of your name, address, e-mail address, order number, and reason for return. This enables us to identify the transaction and speeds up the process, and prevents fraudulent returns.
8.3          Please note that when posting return goods from outside the UK, you are responsible for paying any customs levies or duties on those goods payable either on exit from your country or on entry to the UK. If the goods which you have sent back to us are kept in customs because you have not paid those levies or duties, we will not have received them. Because it is your responsibility to pay all customs duties, legally you will not have returned the goods to us / kept them in your care, and so will not be entitled to any refund / exchange.
8.4          Where you and we agree that an exchange of goods is appropriate, we reserve the right to charge you our costs for posting the exchange goods to you and you should include the appropriate postage amount for the outgoing postage of an exchanged item, or provide written authority for us to take the money from your account. Similarly, where the goods are returned to us as undelivered by your postal service, and we agree to re-send them to you, you will have to pay the additional postage costs.
8.5          Where goods are returned in a damaged, worn or dirty condition, which indicates that they have been worn or used after you have had a reasonable chance to inspect them on receipt, we will consider you to be in breach of your legal duty to take reasonable care of the goods and reserve the right to recover appropriate sums from you.
8.6          Where you return items to us which are not the goods which we dispatched to you (which we can easily check), you will not have returned the goods, and accordingly will be deemed to have accepted the original goods which we sent you. We will notify the police where there is any attempt at fraud or dishonesty (for example where lower value items are returned), and will actively pursue all such cases through the courts. We will also actively fight any fraudulent claim-backs made through your credit card company.
8.7          If you have any problems with your goods or wish to discuss any issues with us, please contact contact@harryhall.com.
8.8          We reserve the right to amend this returns policy without notice under advice from our lawyers or Government appointed agencies.
9. Delivery, transfer of risk and title
9.1          In order to protect against fraud we reserve the right to insist that we ship items to the billing address of the credit or debit card holder. We do check the address you give on your order before shipment. In the event that we have agreed a delivery address with you which is not the billing address, for example at your place of work, or at a friend's or neighbours' address, delivery to you will be deemed to have taken place on a signature being received at that address. Similarly if, at your request, you have given us specific delivery instructions which our courier follows, such as hiding an item in a specific place whilst you are out, it is your responsibility to make sure that you are happy with the security of any address, location or person to which you have asked us to deliver.
9.2          We will contact you with an estimated delivery date, which we will aim to send to you on the same day as the Dispatch Confirmation. Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control. See clause 14 (Events outside our control) for our responsibilities when this happens.
9.3          Delivery is complete once the goods have been unloaded at the address for delivery set out in your order or collected by you or a carrier organised by you to collect them from us and the goods will be at your risk from that time.
9.4          You own the goods once we have received payment in full, including all applicable delivery charges.
9.5          If we fail to deliver the goods, our liability is limited to the cost of obtaining replacement goods of a similar description and quality in the cheapest market available, less the price of the goods. However, we will not be liable to the extent that any failure to deliver was caused by an Event Outside Our Control, or because you failed to provide adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of goods.
9.6          If you fail to take delivery within 10 days after the day on which we notified you that the goods were ready for delivery, we may resell part of, or all the goods and after deducting any reasonable storage and selling costs, account to you for any excess over the price of the goods or charge you for any shortfall below the price of the goods.
10. International delivery
10.1        We deliver to the countries listed on www.harryhall.com/delivery-and-returns (International Delivery Destinations). However, there are restrictions on some goods for certain International Delivery Destinations, so please review the information on that page carefully before ordering goods. We will contact you if we believe there is an issue with the International Delivery Destination you have selected.
10.2        If you order goods from our site for delivery to one of the International Delivery Destinations, your order may be subject to import duties and taxes which are applied when the delivery reaches that destination. Please note that we have no control over these charges and we cannot predict their amount.
10.3        You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.
10.4        You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the goods are destined. We will not be liable or responsible if you break any such law.
11. Price of goods and delivery charges
11.1        The prices of the goods will be as quoted on our site at the time you submit your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of goods are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. However, please see clause 11.5 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of goods you ordered.
11.2        Prices for our goods may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already placed.
11.3        The price of goods includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the goods in full before the change in VAT takes effect.
11.4        The price of the goods does not include delivery charges. Our delivery charges are as advised to you during the check-out process, before you confirm your order. To check relevant delivery charges, please refer to our Delivery Charges page www.harryhall.com/delivery-and-returns
11.5        We sell a large number of goods through our site. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the goods on our site may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the goods you have ordered we will contact you to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the goods at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. If we mistakenly accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may cancel supply of the goods and refund you any sums you have paid.
12. How to pay
12.1        You can pay for goods using a debit card or credit card as accepted by Braintree.
12.2        Payment for the goods and all applicable delivery charges is in advance. We will not charge your debit card or credit card until we dispatch your goods.
13. Manufacturer's guarantee
Some of the goods we sell to you come with a manufacturer's guarantee. For details of the applicable terms and conditions, please refer to the manufacturer's guarantee provided with the goods.
14. Events outside our control
14.1        We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under the Contract that is caused by any act or event beyond our reasonable control (Event Outside Our Control).
14.2        If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations under the Contract:
(a)        we will contact you as soon as reasonably possible to notify you; and
(b)        our obligations under the Contract will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control. Where the Event Outside Our Control affects our delivery of goods to you, we will arrange a new delivery date with you after the Event Outside Our Control is over.
14.3        You may cancel the Contract affected by an Event Outside Our Control which has continued for more than 30 days. To cancel please contact us. If you opt to cancel, you will have to return (at our cost) any relevant goods you have already received and we will refund the price you have paid, including any delivery charges.
15. General
15.1        Assignment and transfer.
(a)        We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under the Contract to another entity.
(b)        You may only assign or transfer your rights or your obligations under the Contract to another person if we agree in writing.
15.2        Variation. Any variation of the Contract only has effect if it is in writing and signed by you and us (or our respective authorised representatives).
15.3        Waiver. If we do not insist that you perform any of your obligations under the Contract, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you or that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive any rights, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any right related to any later default by you.
15.4        Severance. Each paragraph of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them is unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
15.5        Third party rights. The Contract is between you and us. No other person has any rights to enforce any of its terms.
15.6        Governing law and jurisdiction. This Contract is governed by English law and each party irrevocably agrees to submit all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

FAQs
I am a One Club Gold member do I pay delivery on my personalised items?
Yes, due to the process of personalisation, all orders are subject to a £4.95 delivery charge.
If I spend over £50 do I have to pay for delivery?
Yes, all orders for personalisation are subject to a £4.95 delivery charge.
How can I see a preview of my personalised items?
You will see a swatch example of your personalisation on the fabric via the product page. Unfortunately, we are unable to show you a preview of your full garment with personalisation on. Please refer to the product images to get an idea of what your personalised item will look like.
How long will it take to personalise my products?
It will take 10 days for your product to be personalised and delivered. Please note, if you have ordered other items at the same time these will be shipped separately from personalised products.
How much does personalisation cost?
This depends which areas you wish to personalise. Within each product the cost of personalisation is shown, for clothing you can choose to have the chest or back embroidered, and for horse products you can choose to embroider the left side, right side or both – the choice is yours!
How many characters can I add as personalisation?
This depends entirely on the product you want to personalise. On each product page the maximum number of characters is indicated and as you start typing this will countdown. Once you have reached the maximum number you will not be able to type anymore. If you have a longer name which exceeds the character limit we would recommend splitting it over more than one line.
What happens after my order is placed?
We’ll cleverly whizz your personalisation order to our embroiderers who are based near to us in Yorkshire and they’ll ensure your order is completed and shipped to reach you within 7 -10 days of your order being placed. You can sit back, relax and wait for your personalised goods to arrive.
Can I track my personalised order?
It will take around 10 days working days for your product to be personalised and delivered if you haven’t received your item within this time frame please contact us.
Please note, if you have ordered other items at the same time these will be shipped separately from personalised products.
Can I buy normal products at the same time as my personalisation products?
Yes absolutely! You can buy fly spray for your horse at the same time as personalising a yard blouson, please note they will arrive separately and at different times, we hope this is OK and just give our customer services team a call if you want to know anything else – 01274 711 011.
I want to order in bulk for my riding team, is this possible?
Of course, please contact our friendly team on 01274 711 011.
Can I return a personalised item?
As the item has been made especially for you unfortunately returns are not available on your personalised item. We’re pretty sure you’ll be chuffed with your item but if it happens to be faulty or you’re not happy drop us a line and we’ll help you out 01274 711 011.
