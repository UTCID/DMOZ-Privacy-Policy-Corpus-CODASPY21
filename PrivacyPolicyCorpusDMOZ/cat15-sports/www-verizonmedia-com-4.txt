Yahoo Sports: Paid Fantasy Terms of Service
IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS SET FORTH IN SECTION 14.2 OF THE VERIZON MEDIA TERMS OF SERVICE.
ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
This Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy Terms of Service (“Paid Fantasy TOS”) sets forth terms and conditions, in addition to the Verizon Media Terms of Service (“TOS”), that govern your access to and use of the Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy services (“Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy” or the “Services”) and your participation in the contests offered therein (each, a “Contest”). Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy services currently include Yahoo Sports Daily Fantasy, Yahoo Fantasy Best Ball, Yahoo Fantasy Pro Leagues, Yahoo Fantasy Cash Leagues, and Yahoo Fantasy Matchup Challenges. This Paid Fantasy TOS incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of the Yahoo Sports Rewards Points program at https://verizonmedia.com/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/terms/sports/rewardspoints/index.html.
This Paid Fantasy TOS and the TOS, together with any additional terms, addendums, or documents that may be referenced herein and therein (collectively, “Agreement”), form the entire agreement between you and Yahoo Fantasy Sports LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “Yahoo”) in connection with the Services. Your use, or continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the Agreement. Do not use the Services if you do not wish to be bound by the Agreement. Yahoo may update and change this Agreement at any time without notice to you; your access to and/or use of the Services after any such change means you accept such change. At any time you can review the most current version of the Paid Fantasy TOS at  https://verizonmedia.com/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/terms/product-atos/paidfantasy/index.html (and any successor pages) and the most current version of the TOS at https://verizonmedia.com/us/en/verizonmedia/terms/otos/index.html (and any successor pages).
Capitalized terms not defined in this Paid Fantasy TOS have the meanings ascribed to them in the TOS. Certain defined terms in this Paid Fantasy TOS are included in the definitions of capitalized terms in the TOS. In particular, Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy is a “ Service”; accordingly, all references in the TOS to Service incorporate by reference Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Paid Fantasy TOS and the TOS, the terms of the Paid Fantasy TOS shall control. The imposition of additional enumerated restrictions or liabilities on your actions or omissions, by one document over the other, shall not be considered in and of itself a conflict.
ELIGIBILITY
The Contests are void where prohibited. To be eligible to enter any paid Contest, you must meet all of the following conditions:
You are at least 18 years of age (19 if located in AL or NE, or 21 if located in MA);
You are physically located in the following regions at the time of contest entry: the District of Columbia, the fifty United States (except for Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana,  Montana, Nevada, and Washington) or Canada, except Quebec (collectively, the “Eligibility Area”); Note: The Eligibility Area for Matchup Challenges also excludes Arkansas, Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee.
You are physically located in the Eligibility Area at the time of your entry into a Contest; and
You are not listed on any US Government prohibited or watch list.
You may also be required to sign and return an Affidavit of Eligibility as proof of your eligibility to participate in the Contests. You will be required to provide this information within ten (10) days after Yahoo first attempts to contact you. If you fail to comply with this deadline, Yahoo may disqualify you from further participation, and withhold or revoke any prizes at its sole discretion. If Yahoo chooses to disqualify you on this basis, it will refund the Contest entry fee for the Contest from which you were disqualified.
Employees and agents of Yahoo, its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotional agencies, any other prize sponsor and any entity involved in the development, production, implementation, administration or fulfillment of the Contests (all the foregoing, together with Yahoo, collectively referred to as “Contest Entities”), and the immediate family members and persons living in the same household as any of the above may not participate in any publicly available paid Contests or free Contests with cash or cash equivalent prizes except for purposes of testing the user experience on a limited basis. Participation in free Contests with no prizes and private paid Contests is permitted.
Athletes, coaches, and other team management, team support personnel, and team owners are not eligible for any Yahoo Contests in the sport or sports in which their team competes. Team owners, referees, league employees, sports commissioners, sports agents and other individuals who, through an ownership interest or game-related employment, can influence gameplay in the real world game are also ineligible.
HOW TO REGISTER
A valid Yahoo ID is required to participate in Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy. If you do not have a Yahoo ID, you will be prompted to sign up for one before being permitted to enter or participate in a Contest offered on the Service. Please ensure that your contact information is accurate, up-to-date, and complete. This information is mandatory if you wish to be eligible to win and collect prizes. A user who has not provided valid registration information will automatically be deemed ineligible and will not be considered for a prize. A valid PayPal account or credit card (Yahoo Fantasy Pro Leagues and Yahoo Fantasy Cash Leagues only)  is also required to add funds to your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account and to receive and collect a prize. A valid PayPal account or credit card may only be associated with a single Yahoo ID. Deposit limits will be clearly marked on your account settings page. You may request an increase in your deposit limit, and may lower your deposit limit at any time. For more information please refer to our Responsible Gaming Policy.
Please note that Contests may only be played under the Yahoo ID with which they were created or entered, and may not be transferred to another Yahoo ID or played by another person. Also, you may not share an account with another person or allow another user to play under your Yahoo ID. Likewise, you may not enter a Contest on behalf of someone without a Yahoo ID, or that is ineligible to participate in the Contest. As a rule, each Contest entrant ("Entrant") is allowed to play under one Yahoo ID. It is at Yahoo's sole discretion and judgment to determine whether multiple Yahoo IDs belong to the same Entrant. If you are found to be participating in the Contests using more than one Yahoo ID, such penalties may include, but are not limited to, disqualification from current and future Contests and forfeiture of Contest entry fee(s) or potential winnings.
GAME RULES
How To Play:
Daily Fantasy
In addition to these rules, additional rules, instructions and guidelines regarding game play and scoring (which are fully incorporated into this Paid Fantasy TOS by reference) are listed in the Official Rules section below under “Official Daily Fantasy Rules”. In the event of a conflict between the Official Daily Fantasy Rules and the Paid Fantasy TOS, the Paid Fantasy TOS will control. For multi-round Contests, additional rules and details may apply and will be posted with such multi-round Contest.
Best Ball
In addition to these rules, additional rules, instructions and guidelines regarding game play and scoring (which are fully incorporated into this Paid Fantasy TOS by reference) are located at the Official Rules section below under “Official Best Ball Rules”. In the event of a conflict between the Official Best Ball Rules and the Paid Fantasy TOS, the Paid Fantasy TOS will control.
In order to be prize-eligible in Best Ball Contests, you must either edit your pre-draft rankings or manually make at least one pick during the draft. If you do not edit your pre-draft rankings or make at least one manual pick, you will not be eligible to win any prizes. Auto-draft is not allowed as an option during Best Ball drafts. If you disconnect from the draft we will make picks on your behalf, but you will not be prize eligible unless you make at least one pick (or have edited your pre-draft rankings). In addition, if your optimal lineup consists of players from less than three teams, you will not be eligible to win prizes.
Pro Leagues
In addition to these rules, additional rules, instructions and guidelines regarding game play and scoring (which are fully incorporated into this Paid Fantasy TOS by reference) are listed under the Official Rules section below under “Official Pro League Rules”. In the event of a conflict between the Official Pro League Rules and the Paid Fantasy TOS, the Paid Fantasy TOS will control.
In order to be prize-eligible in Pro League contests, you must make at least one draft pick, and either one adjustment to your starting lineup or one roster move during the season. In the event that a potential prize winner is deemed ineligible for any reason, the prize will be awarded to the next eligible participant in the League's final standings. Should such a substitution be necessary, the prize positions will be shifted proportionally. For example, if a potential second place prize winner is deemed ineligible, the third place finisher, if eligible, will be awarded the second place prize, the fourth place finisher, if eligible, will be awarded the third place prize, and so on. No winner will receive double prizes as the result of a higher-ranked participant being deemed ineligible.
Collusion in Pro Leagues is expressly prohibited. You may not collude with other managers to attempt to join the same league, or collude in any way throughout the season to stack or in any way provide an unfair advantage to one team or another.
Cash Leagues
Cash Leagues Contests are private, custom leagues and the commissioner, in conjunction with Yahoo, may configure League Settings accordingly. Yahoo will administer the collection of entry fees and awarding of cash prizes but will not transmit funds on behalf of commissioners or Entrants.
Commissioner permissions and tools are restricted in Cash League Contests. Some commissioner tools are completely unavailable.  Some become unavailable when the Commissioner has formally locked teams into the League or when teams can enter the draft (whichever comes first).  Other  commissioner tools are always available. See our help article for a complete list of Commissioners Tools and when they lock in Cash League Contests.
Commissioners may convert existing private leagues created to Cash Leagues so long as the league has not yet drafted. After a league has drafted, it may not convert to a Cash League unless the commissioner resets the draft and schedules a new draft for the league.
Cash Leagues allows for different league sizes, from as few as 4 teams to as many as 20. In order for a Contest to run, the League must have the number teams listed in the League Settings. A Contest will not run unless all slots have been filled and paid. If your League does not fill up before its scheduled draft time, the draft will not take place. If the draft does not take place for this reason, the commissioner may reschedule the draft, cancel the Contest or delete the League (which automatically cancels the Contest). If a League is filled at the scheduled draft time but not all teams have paid the entry fee, the draft will proceed. However, all teams must pay by the deadline set by the commissioner or the Contest will be canceled.
If a Contest is cancelled, and all managers will be issued a refund to the payment method used for the Contest. The League in which the Contest was cancelled may still draft but the Contest associated with the League will be void.
In the event that a potential prize winner is deemed ineligible for any reason, the prize will be awarded to the next eligible participant in the League's final standings. Should such a substitution be necessary, the prize positions will be shifted proportionally. For example, if a potential second place prize winner is deemed ineligible, the third place finisher, if eligible, will be awarded the second place prize, the fourth place finisher, if eligible, will be awarded the third place prize, and so on. No winner will receive double prizes as the result of a higher-ranked participant being deemed ineligible.
In order to be prize-eligible in Cash League contests, you must make at least one draft pick, and either one adjustment to your starting lineup or one roster move during the season.
Matchup Challenges
In addition to these rules, additional rules, instructions and guidelines regarding game play and scoring (which are fully incorporated into this Paid Fantasy TOS by reference) are located at the Official Rules section below under “Official Matchup Challenges Rules”. In the event of a conflict between the Official Matchup Challenges Rules and the Paid Fantasy TOS, the Paid Fantasy TOS will control.
In order to participate in Matchup Challenges, you must make at least one manual draft pick during the draft. If you do not make at least one manual draft pick, you will not be eligible to participate in Matchup Challenges.  In addition, if your lineup consists of players from less than three teams, your entry will be canceled.
Contest of Skill:
All Contests offered on Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy are contests of skill. Contest winners are determined using the criteria set forth in the posted rules for each Contest, and through the relative knowledge and skill of entrants to score the highest amount of Contest points from the accumulated statistical results of the performance of individual athletes in multiple real-world sporting events. All prizes offered are established and made known to entrants in advance of a Contest and the value of prizes is not determined by the number of entrants or the amount of any fees paid by those entrants. No Contests offered on Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy are based on the score, point spread, or any performance(s) of any single real-world team or any combination of such teams, or solely on any single performance of an individual athlete in any single real-world sporting or other event.
Contest Entry:
Contests on Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy will display an entry fee listed in US dollars. Once you select the Contest you wish to enter, your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account balance will be debited for the respective entry fee amount. Additional funds may be added to your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account at any time if you do not have enough funds to enter a Contest.
Certain Contests, such as Daily Fantasy Contests, may offer an entry reservation feature. These Contests will permit you to pay your entry fee to reserve a space in the Contest without completing your lineup. Once you reserve your entry in any Contest with this feature, your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account balance will be debited for the respective entry fee amount. If you do not return to your entry and submit a lineup before lineups lock, you will be awarded zero points in the Contest and your entry fee will not be refunded.
Contest Term:
The term and length of each individual Contest will depend on the professional sport related to that Contest, generally commencing and ending either on a single day, over the course of a week, or over the course of an entire season. The length of each individual Contest will be explicitly stated on its respective Contest page.
Prizes:
All prizes offered are established and made known to Contest entrants in advance of each Contest and are listed on each respective Contest page. Shortly following the conclusion of each Contest, Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy will display the list of potential Contest winners (subject to verification). These Contest results will not be changed due to any subsequent official adjustments of statistics by Yahoo’s data providers unless otherwise determined by Yahoo at its sole discretion. In the event of a tie in Yahoo Daily Fantasy or Yahoo Fantasy Best Ball, Yahoo will combine the winning prizes and evenly distribute the prizes to the tied entrants. For example, if three participants tie for 1st place, with 1st place winning $100, 2nd place winning $50, and 3rd place winning $30, each of the tied entrants will receive $60. Winners will have their prizes credited to their Yahoo Fantasy Sports account. For Pro Leagues and Cash Leagues, in the event of a tie in the Standings of two or more teams at the conclusion of the Fantasy Regular Season, or a matchup tie between two teams during the Fantasy Playoffs, the tie will be broken using the tiebreak formulas described in the Regular Season Tiebreak Rules and Playoff Tiebreak Rules articles, respectively.
All potential winners are subject to verification by Yahoo, and must meet all eligibility requirements before a prize will be awarded.
Prizes may not be transferred or assigned except by Yahoo. Only listed prizes will be awarded and no substitutions, equivalents or redemptions will be made. Expenses not specifically stated in this Paid Fantasy TOS, together with the reporting and payment of all applicable taxes, fees, and/or surcharges, if any, arising out of, or resulting from, acceptance or use of a prize, are the sole responsibility of the winner of that prize. A potential winner may be required to provide additional documentation (such as social security number) in order to comply with tax and other legal reporting requirements. Each winner may receive an IRS Form 1099 for the value of the prize awarded. As required by law in certain jurisdictions, Yahoo may withhold verified prize winnings from entrants with delinquent child support obligations. Contest Entities expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for injury or loss to any person or property relating to the delivery and/or subsequent use of the prizes awarded. Contest Entities make no representations or warranties concerning the appearance, safety, or performance of any prize awarded. Any unclaimed prizes will not be awarded. Restrictions, conditions, and limitations apply. Contest Entities will not replace any lost or stolen prize items.
Accessing Funds:
Cash deposits for entry fees and cash prize winnings are held by Yahoo in one or more separate, segregated accounts (each, a "Segregated Account"). The funds held in the Segregated Account(s) do not belong to Yahoo or the Contest Entities and it is our intention and practice to take all reasonable actions to make sure that such funds are not available to creditors of Yahoo other than to players whose funds are held in the Segregated Account. Yahoo and the Contest Entities do not and will not commingle the funds in the Segregated Account with any other funds belonging to Yahoo or the Contest Entities. Yahoo and the Contest Entities do not and will not use the funds in the Segregated Account for its operating expenses or any other purpose. If you believe that funds in your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account have been misallocated, compromised or otherwise mishandled, you may contact us online using the "Contact us" link in the footers of Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy websites, the “Help” section of the Yahoo Fantasy app or the  Contact Us links below.
Entrants may access cash prize winnings and any cash deposits for entry fees (excluding bonuses and promotions) from their Yahoo Fantasy Sports account once funds have settled. Requests for access to funds will be honored by the later of five business days of the request or ten business days of the submission of any tax reporting documentation required by applicable law, unless Yahoo believes in good faith that the Entrant engaged in fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would cause Yahoo to be in violation of applicable law. Available funds will be credited directly into the Entrant's PayPal account, or such other means as Yahoo determines in its sole discretion. Please review the PayPal User Agreement for more information.
Bonuses and promotions may be offered by Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy from time-to-time. Any cash bonuses and promotions an entrant receives may not be available to access from your Yahoo Fantasy Sports account unless certain conditions are met as stated by the terms for each applicable bonus, or promotion. These terms may include, but are not limited to, using the bonus to enter into at least one Contest with an entry fee greater than zero dollars. Any attempted abuse of bonuses is prohibited, and may result in the loss of bonuses, and the suspension of all playing privileges on Yahoo Sports Paid Fantasy.
Cancellation Policy:
If any Contest is not capable of running as planned, for any reason including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes beyond the control of Contest Entities which corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of any Contest, Yahoo reserves the right at its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend a Contest without any further obligation.
In the event Yahoo is prevented from continuing with a Contest or the integrity and/or feasibility of a Contest is severely undermined by any event beyond the control of Yahoo, including but not limited to fire, flood, epidemic, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, war (declared or undeclared), terrorist threat or activity, or any federal, state or local government law, order, or regulation, order of any court or jurisdiction, infection by computer virus, unauthorized intervention, technical failures or other cause not reasonably within the control of Yahoo (each a “Force Majeure” event or occurrence), Yahoo reserves the right at its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend a Contest without any further obligation.
