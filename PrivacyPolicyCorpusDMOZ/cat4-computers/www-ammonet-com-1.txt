Privacy PolicyAcceptable Use Policy ammonet Privacy PolicyDisclaimerammonet InfoTech does not release the names, e-mail addresses nor postal addresses of its customers to anyone except in cases of fraud and other illegal activities related to web sites hosted on our servers. In the event of fraud, we pro-actively and vigorously collaborate with the law enforcement authorities.
On rare occasions only, ammonet sends e-mail to all of its customers collectively regarding technical and other relevant matters. Unfortunately, there is a widespread deception in use by senders of SPAM in which a false return address is used, apparently that of your hosting provider. Any e-mail with an apparent ammonet return address which contains material irrelevant to ammonet's business or which is inconsistent with ammonet's conservative business practices should be treated with suspicion and disregarded. For further information on unsolicited e-mail (SPAM), please click here.
