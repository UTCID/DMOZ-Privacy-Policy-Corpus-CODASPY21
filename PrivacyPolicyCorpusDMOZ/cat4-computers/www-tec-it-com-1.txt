Cookies
TEC-IT Websites are using cookies. A cookie is a small file, which is stored by the web-server on your computer/hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to execute programs or to spread viruses. Cookies are assigned to a specific user of a TEC-IT Website. One of the major reasons for using cookies is to improve the usability of Websites and to save time. The user of TEC-IT web pages has the option to accept or reject cookies. Most web browsers accept cookies automatically. However, browsers can be set by the user to only allow cookies from certain web pages. If the user decides to reject cookies from TEC-IT web pages, it may happen that the use of TEC-IT web pages is not or only partially possible. Certain cookies are used to identify a browser session (session cookies) and are deleted from your hard disk after the browser has been closed.
Log files
Every time you access our website, usage data is transmitted by the browser and stored in so-called server log files. The data sets that are stored contain the following data: date and time of retrieval, name of page accessed, IP address, referrer URL (origin URL from which you were redirected to our website), the amount of data transferred, product and version information of the used browser.
Subject to any legal retention requirements, users' IP addresses will be deleted after the end of use, at the latest after 30 days.
We occasionally evaluate these log file records anonymously in order to improve our web presence or to find and correct errors. In addition, we can also detect and fix any errors in our web services faster by analyzing the log files.
Google Analytics
Web Analytics Service
This website uses the "Google Analytics" service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) to analyze users' website usage. The relationship with the web analytics service provider is based on the European Commissions Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of online advertising and measurement personal data out of the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland.
IP Anonymization
This site uses IP anonymization. Your IP address will therefore be shortened by Google before further use within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and thus used only anonymously. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.
On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services related to website activity and internet usage.
The (shortened) IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data provided by Google.
Cookies
Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files stored on your computer that allow us to analyze the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually sent to a server from Google in the US and stored there.

Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive any information that personally identifies Internet users. Internet users who do not want to participate in tracking can deactivate the Google Conversion Tracking cookie through the settings of the Internet browser used. These internet users will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
Google reCAPTCHA
To prevent spam and abuse, we use the service "Google reCAPTCHA" (Version 3) of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google") on our websites. This function is primarily used to distinguish whether an entry (e.g. in a contact form) is made by a natural person or is abused by automated processing. For this reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor on the basis of different characteristics (duration of stay, mouse movements...). The service includes the transmission of the IP address and possibly further data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google.
The reCAPTCHA analyses start with entering the website and run completely in the background, website visitors are not informed separately. Data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting his web offers from abusive automated spying and from SPAM.
Additional information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.com/recaptcha and https://policies.google.com/privacy.
Microsoft Advertising
This website uses the Conversion-Tracking Technology Microsoft Advertising of Microsoft Corporation. For this purpose, a cookie is placed on your computer if you visited our website via Bing or Yahoo. By means of this small text file, information about the use of our website (i.e. the pages you visit) is stored by Microsoft Advertising for 180 days and then deleted. This information includes, but is not limited to, the URL of the page visited, the URL of the referrer page, and your IP address. However, we do not obtain any information by which users can be identified personally.
If you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you may object to this usage by easily deactivating the Microsoft Advertising conversion tracking cookie via your internet browser and your user settings.

You can access Microsoft's privacy policy for the data collected by following this link: https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement/.
Use of Social Media Plugins

By clicking on Accept in the cookie banner of our websites (or in the video), you consent to the processing of data by the social network operator (YouTube). Only after consenting a connection is established from your browser to YouTube and data transferred to the operator of the social network. The consent remains stored in your browser via cookies.
The social network receives information about your visit to our websites via the plugin. If you are logged in to YouTube, your visit can be assigned to your social network account. Any interactions with the plugin can be saved by the network operator.

Unless you have a prior written agreement with TEC-IT that your information should be treated as confidential you agree to the following:
All information posted on or transmitted to TEC-IT Websites including, data, material, code snippets, samples, requests, comments and suggestions can be used by TEC-IT for any purpose. By sending TEC-IT any information or material, you grant TEC-IT an unrestricted, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, transmit and distribute those materials and information. You also agree that TEC-IT is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques that you send to TEC-IT for any purpose without any obligation to you.
Android/iOSPrivacy Policy for Mobile Apps
TEC-IT's apps are designed to record data only to the minimum required extent and to protect the user's privacy. Our apps do not use in-app advertising
and process data exclusively to fulfill the apps intended purpose. With the exception of anonymized crash statistics TEC-IT does not access, store or otherwise process the data which is available to an app. Data processed by an app will not be disclosed or shared with other users or third parties.
Points of Special Interest:
Key Logging
Some of our Android apps (especially Barcode/NFC Scanner Keyboard, GetBlue and BluePiano) are intended (or can be configured to operate) as an alternative input method. On Android, an alternative input method replaces the standard soft-keyboard with another one and thus has the theoretical possibility to log all keystrokes. This is the reason why the Android system displays a warning when such an alternative input method is enabled by the user. This warning does not automatically imply that the app in question will log the keystrokes or exposes you to any risks and vulnerabilities.
In short: TEC-IT apps do not log, store or disclose user input.
Credentials
Some TEC-IT apps can be configured to access online services (like Google Docs or Google Sheets) to store or retrieve information. In order to access such online services the user needs to enter his credentials. The credentials are stored on the device and are used by the app exclusively for the purpose of accessing the specified online service.
In short: TEC-IT apps use credentials only for the intended purpose.
If your device gets lost or stolen you should be aware that this exposes you to risks and vulnerabilities. In such a case, we recommend you to change your credentials for the involved online services as soon as possible.
Device Information
For volume or bulk-licensing purposes, special versions of our apps (available for download exclusively on tec-it.com) can be licensed via TEC-IT's activation server. For each single activation, this activation server records date/time, masked IP address and a hashed device ID (one of device serial number, Android ID (Android), Identifier for Vendor (iOS), IMEI). This information is treated confidential and kept private by TEC-IT.
In short: For bulk licensing purposes, TEC-IT records masked and/or hashed device information.
Geolocations
When you enable location services in our mobile apps (e.g. Scan-IT to Office), the app uses GPS or another similar technology to determine your current location. The app uses this information only for the intended purpose, the data is not used for any other purpose or shared with anyone else.
In short: TEC-IT apps use geolocation data only for the intended purpose.
Sensor Data
Some of our apps provide data collection features using sensors (e.g. NFC or devices connected via Bluetooth). The app uses this information exclusively to fulfill its intended purpose, the data is not used for any other purpose or shared with anyone else.
In short: TEC-IT apps use sensor data only for the intended purpose.
Crash Statistics
To improve and monitor performance and stability, some of our apps use Google Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) for collecting crash statistics. This information is anonymized and does not contain personal or user information.
In short: TEC-IT does not collect app data beyond crash and performance statistics.
