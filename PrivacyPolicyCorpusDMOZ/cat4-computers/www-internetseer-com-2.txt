GENERAL
By checking the "I agree to the Terms and Conditions" box in the activation page and / or by using the InternetSeer Web Site (the "Site") and or Web site monitoring services or other services provided by InternetSeer (the "Service" or "Services"), you agree to be bound by the InternetSeer Services Agreement Terms and Conditions (the "Agreement" or "Terms and Conditions") and the InternetSeer Privacy Policy, referred to collectively as the "Rules". Please read the Rules before activating an account with InternetSeer or using the InternetSeer Web site.
If you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions and to be bound by the Rules you should discontinue your use of the InternetSeer services. Your InternetSeer account will not be activated or your Service will be terminated, as applicable. If at any time you do not agree to be bound by these Rules and the scope of the InternetSeer services you should immediately end your use of InternetSeer services.
InternetSeer may change the Rules and the scope of the InternetSeer services in whole or in part, at any time without notice. Such changes will be posted on the InternetSeer site and such posting will constitute notice to you. Links to the Rules can be found on the InternetSeer home page, located at http://www.InternetSeer.com. Each time before using the InternetSeer services, you agree to review changes to the Rules and, if any change is not acceptable to you, you agree to terminate use of InternetSeer services. Your continued use of InternetSeer services after the posting of any such change constitutes your acceptance of all the changes.
This Agreement is hereby entered into between InternetSeer and the party executing this Agreement ("Subscriber") on the following terms and conditions. Whereas InternetSeer provides Web site monitoring Services and the subscriber wishes to use InternetSeer's Service, the parties agree as follows:
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
All Subscribers are required to abide by the Rules. By activating an account, you become a Subscriber. You then agree to indemnify and hold harmless InternetSeer for any loss, liability, and damage arising from or in connection with the contents or service of any InternetSeer Service.
InternetSeer is not responsible, directly, indirectly or consequentially, for the content or the suitability of the information contained in the email alerts and reports generated by InternetSeer or in the My InternetSeer information and reports included on the InternetSeer Web site. InternetSeer has exercised reasonable care to ensure that the information in the email alerts and reports generated by InternetSeer is correct and accurate based on the input collected.
InternetSeer does not accept liability for any damage direct, indirect or consequential for the use of the services or information associated with the Web sites monitored by InternetSeer nor does InternetSeer accept any responsibility and / or liability, directly, indirectly, or consequentially, for failures or omissions with regard to the alert notifications email reports.
The Subscriber agrees that Internetseer is not liable for any monetary amount with regard to the Standard (free) services. The subscriber agrees that Internetseer is not liable for any monetary amount in excess of the fees paid to InternetSeer by Subscriber during the preceding twelve months with regard to the Fee-based (paid) services. In no event shall Internetseer be liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages (including lost savings or profit, lost data or business interruption even if Internetseer is notified in advance of such possibility). This includes damages incurred by the subscriber, the subscriber's own customers or any third party.
Internetseer disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose in connection with this.
InternetSeer currently offers a Standard Service at no cost
to Subscribers as well as fee-based Services. Although Internetseer presently has no plans to discontinue the Standard Service or the fee-based Services or to change the price of the fee-based Services, InternetSeer does not guarantee that it will continue to offer the Standard Service at no cost or the fee-based Services at the current price to Subscribers in the future. InternetSeer reserves the right to discontinue or modify the Standard Service and to change the
price of the fee-based Services without notice to the Subscriber other than by disclosure on the InternetSeer Web site.
REFUNDS, CREDITS AND CANCELLATIONS
The
Standard
Service is provided at no cost to the Subscriber. The fee-based Services are based on a monthly or yearly fee paid via the Subscriber's credit card. InternetSeer does not issue credits or refunds in the event of a change in services requested or cancellations. The cost to track and issue credits or refunds would be relatively high and the benefit would be relatively low considering the nominal monthly fees.
FORCE MAJEURE
Except for Subscriber's payment obligations, neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performing any obligation under this agreement that is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as natural catastrophes, government acts or omissions, laws or regulations, labor strikes, communications systems breakdowns, hardware or software failures, transportation stoppages or slowdowns, or the inability to procure supplies or materials.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATIONS
The terms of this agreement constitute the entire agreement between InternetSeer and the Subscriber regarding its subject matter and its terms supercede any prior or simultaneous agreement or terms, whether oral or written. Except as provided herein, any waiver, modification, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the parties herein.
NO ASSIGNMENT
Subscriber may not assign, resell, or license this agreement or the Services provided hereunder, without the prior written consent of InternetSeer.
Services Agreement Terms and Conditions in Legal Terms
1.0 - General
InternetSeer.com Corp. ("InternetSeer") reserves the right to prohibit any conduct or to remove any materials or content in violation of the Rules or which InternetSeer believes in its sole discretion to be illegal or potentially harmful to others or may expose InternetSeer to harm or liability. InternetSeer may suspend or terminate your use of InternetSeer Services if it determines that you have failed to comply with any of the Rules. InternetSeer reserves the right to take or terminate the use of any user name or email address at any time.

2.0 - InternetSeer Obligations
InternetSeer Services. Subject to the Rules, and such other regulations that InternetSeer may adopt from time to time, InternetSeer will provide Subscriber with Standard or Fee-based remote Web site monitoring services.

The free services are supported by our advertisers and sponsors.

InternetSeer provides information on the InternetSeer Site regarding parental control software available through various third party vendors, but you should know that such software is not completely effective in preventing minors' access to material that is unsuitable for children. InternetSeer does not endorse any of these third parties and makes no representation as to them or their software.
Activation Information. You must register for InternetSeer Services using your own name. During activation, you will be asked to provide the name or number you wish to use as your login identification. If the login identification you request is not available you will be asked to supply another login identification. InternetSeer reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information you submit in connection with your activation for InternetSeer Services (including, without limitation, performing cross tabulations with external databases) and you hereby consent to InternetSeer's verification of such information.
Other Charges. You are responsible for any and all charges related to your use of InternetSeer services, including, but not limited to, all calls you make to InternetSeer's Customer Service lines.
Use of your InternetSeer Account. You are responsible for all use of your InternetSeer Services and for the security of your login identification, your password and any security lock code that you use to protect access to your data, InternetSeer personal profile, your file name(s) and files, network and user access, and any information you disseminate through use of InternetSeer Services or through other Internet services.
No Resale of InternetSeer Services and InternetSeer Site. The InternetSeer Services are for use of registered Subscribers only and may not be copied, resold, leased, transferred, exchanged or bartered. You must not use this service in any way that causes an unreasonable load on the system or deviates from its intended use. You must not set up any automated programs to interact or act upon our systems without prior written consent from InternetSeer. You must not cause an unreasonable or unwanted load on any third party systems. Upon acceptance of these terms, you have a nonexclusive license to use the Service. You agree not to modify, change, disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer any software or service provided by InternetSeer.
You must not cause or allow robots or other automated processes to act upon or interact with InternetSeer's Web site or systems or user interfaces without prior written consent from InternetSeer.
Use of Data.
Subscribers and all visitors agree that all data generated by the services are for Subscriber's internal use and reference only.
If Subscribers use the InternetSeer services to monitor Web sites or devices, which Subscriber does not directly own, Subscriber agrees not to publish or otherwise disclose data acquired about such Web site or device.
Duplicate Accounts.
Subscribers may not create or activate duplicate accounts without prior written consent.
Links to Third Party Sites. The InternetSeer Site contains links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. In some instances these sites are co-branded and the third parties are entitled to use InternetSeer's name and logo on these sites. InternetSeer does not always control the information, products, or services on these third party sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by InternetSeer of the site or any association with their operators. Because InternetSeer has no control over such sites and resources, you agree that InternetSeer is not responsible or liable for the availability or the operation of such external sites, for any material located on or available from any such sites, or for the protection of your privacy data by third parties. Any dealings with or participation in promotions of advertisers on our Service, including the payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and the advertiser or other third party. You further agree that InternetSeer shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage caused by the use of or reliance on any such material available on or through any such site or any such dealings or promotions.
4.0 - Your payment obligations
You understand and agree that fees for services will be billed to the credit card you provide on the Site on a monthly or yearly basis as disclosed on the checkout page of the Site. If your credit card is not valid or if payment is not made for any reason the subscriber will be considered in default under the Agreement. If any payment due to the Company under this Agreement is not paid when due, Subscriber agrees to pay interest on the past due amount on a daily basis from the due date until the date paid at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law.
Refunds, Credits and Cancellations. The Standard Service is at no cost to the Subscriber. The Fee-based Service is based on a monthly or yearly fee paid via the Subscriber's credit card. InternetSeer does not issue credits or refunds in the event of a change in services requested or cancellations. The cost to track and issue credits or refunds would be relatively high and the benefit would be relatively low considering the comparatively low monthly fees.
Automatic renewal. This Agreement will automatically renew at the monthly or yearly service price unless Subscriber cancels the account on the Site or sends written notice that he or she does not want it to renew at least fifteen (15) days before the end of the services term. The Company may cancel the automatic renewal term by sending Subscriber written notice that the Company does not want the Agreement to renew, at least fifteen (15) days before the end of the month.
