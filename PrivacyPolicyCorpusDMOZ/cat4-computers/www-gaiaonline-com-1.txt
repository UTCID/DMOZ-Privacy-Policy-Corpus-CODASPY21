Gaia may remove any Member Submission or terminate any Member account and/or ban any Member at any time for any action in violation of these Terms including, for conduct detrimental to other Members or Gaia, or for any other reason that in Gaia’s sole discretion warrants such termination.
Eligibility; Account Information. Gaia Online is not available to persons under the age of 13.
You agree that the date of birth and all other information you provide to Gaia during Member registration and, at all other times, will be true, accurate, current and complete. You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. Gaia may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer Gaia Online to any person or entity. Gaia may change its eligibility criteria at any time. Any Members previously suspended or removed from Gaia Online by Gaia may not be permitted to re-join.
Gold/Platinum, Virtual Currency. Throughout your Gaia Online experience, you may accumulate "Gold/Platinum", which constitutes a limited license right to use a feature of Gaia Online when, as, and if allowed by Gaia. Gold/Platinum is the fictional currency used in the world of Gaia Online and it may only be used to purchase virtual goods or virtual services which are stored in the Member's inventory and can be used to enhance the look of the Member's on-line persona or player, also known as an "Avatar", or other on-site features. Gaia may charge fees for the right to use Gold/Platinum, or may distribute Gold/Platinum without charge, in its sole discretion. Regardless of terminology used, Gold/Platinum represents a limited license right governed solely under these Terms, has no real value, and is not transferable or redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Gaia at any time. As a condition of using Gaia Online and accumulating Gold/Platinum, you agree that Gaia has the absolute right to reduce, manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Gold/Platinum, including the Gold/Platinum in your inventory, as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and that Gaia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such rights. Upon your closing of your account or the termination of your account by Gaia as provided in these terms, you understand that your limited license to use Gold/Platinum will be terminated and that no sum shall be due and owing to you for the Gold/Platinum accumulated in your inventory or account.
Notwithstanding any other language to the contrary, as used in these Terms and throughout Gaia Online in the context of Gold/Platinum transfers: (a) the term "sell" means "to transfer for consideration to another Member or Gaia the licensed right to use Gold/Platinum in accordance with these Terms" and (b) the term "buy" means "to receive for consideration from another Member or Gaia the licensed right to use Gold/Platinum in accordance with these Terms". Gaia may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Gold/Platinum transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of these Terms or other laws or regulations, to conform with revisions to these Terms, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with Gaia Online, such as creating multiple secondary accounts strictly to accumulate Gold/Platinum by using site features and then funneling it to a singular account.
Fees and Payment Terms; Subscriptions.
Gaia may charge fees for certain features. Should you elect to use such features, you shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Website. Gaia reserves the right to change its fees at any time, and will provide notice upon the site. Use of Gaia Online by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges. If you buy "Gaia Cash" to purchase virtual merchandise or services, or otherwise buy products or services from Gaia Online, then you agree to pay for any such purchases of Gaia Cash, products and services and we may charge your selected payment method to collect any such payments. You are required to keep your billing information current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or expiration date) and notify Gaia if your selected payment method is cancelled or compromised (e.g., for loss or theft).
You may elect to automatically replenish the Gaia Cash in your account on a monthly basis through our Angel Subscription service. Currently, we offer replenishments in the amount of $5.00/per month, $20.00/per month, $100.00/per month and $300.00/per month. If you enroll in Angel Subscription, then the replenishment amount you choose will be automatically billed to your credit card, debit card or PayPal account on a recurring monthly basis. As a subscription Member you are entitled to receive all subscription membership benefits listed at https://www.gaiaonline.com/payments/braintree/, which are subject to change by Gaia Online from time to time. If you want to cancel your subscription membership, you must go to https://www.gaiaonline.com/payments/braintree/ and click "cancel". Please allow forty-eight (48) hours for your subscription cancellation to go into effect. Accordingly, you may be billed for one additional month's subscription fee after you go online to cancel your subscription. Gaia reserves the right to modify or cancel its subscription membership program at any time. In the event of an increase in the cost of the monthly subscription, Gaia will endeavor to give an opportunity to cancel your subscription before increasing its monthly subscription fees. If you run into any issues, then please file a Billing Inquiry Ticket at our Help Center located at: https://www.gaiaonline.com/help
You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account made by you or anyone who uses your account (including your children, family, or friends). If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. Your account may be deactivated without notice to you if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount. You are also responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your purchase from or use of Gaia Online, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. To the extent Gaia is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.
ALL SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR ITEMS, IF ANY, ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GAIA IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY BACK OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR YOUR INVENTORY OF VIRTUAL GOLD/PLATINUM, CASH OR ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY OR IN THE EVENT THAT GAIA DISCONTINUES THE SITE.
Termination. You agree that Gaia, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may have with Gaia or your use of Gaia Online and remove and discard all or any part of your account including its inventory of any virtual items, Gaia Gold/Platinum, Gaia Cash Member profile, or any Member Submission, at any time. All items, Gaia Gold/Platinum, Gaia Cash, and other aspects of your account are considered to be a limited license to you for your use while your account is in open.
Due to the limited nature of the license, the inventory in your account, your Member Submissions and any other virtual items (including Gaia Gold/Platinum and Gaia Cash), creations or submissions are considered to be forfeit when you close your account, when the account is banned for violation of the Terms or otherwise terminated as provided herein or in the event that Gaia discontinues the Site. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. Gaia may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing access to Gaia Online, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to Gaia Online or any account you may have or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice, and you agree that Gaia shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination. As discussed herein, Gaia does not permit copyright infringing activities on Gaia Online, and reserves the right to terminate access to Gaia Online, and remove all content submitted, by any Members who are found to be infringers. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity or any of the other prohibited conduct as set forth herein shall be grounds for immediate termination of your use of Gaia Online and, in certain circumstances, referral to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Gaia may have under these Terms, at law or in equity.
Password. When you register as a Member you will be asked to provide a password. You will be responsible for all activities that occur within your account; you should keep your password confidential. You are solely responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your password, or any credit, debit or charge card number), immediately notify Gaia. You may be liable for the losses incurred by Gaia or others due to any unauthorized use of your account.
