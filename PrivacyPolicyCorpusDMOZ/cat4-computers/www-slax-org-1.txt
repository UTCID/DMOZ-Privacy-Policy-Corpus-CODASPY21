Privacy Policy you agree to this
Your privacy is important to us. So we've developed a
Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and
store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself
with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.
This website strives to offer its users the
many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information
(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to
the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent
your email address to any unauthorized third party.
How we gather information from users
We never collect your personal information while using
Slax (the software application). However, we may
collect your personal information while visiting our website
(slax.org). How we collect and store information depends on the page
you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and
the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide
information when you register for access to certain portions of our site
or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
purchase. Like most Web sites, slax.org also collects information
automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
hold information from your visit. As we adopt additional technology, we
may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you
can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting
your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be
unable to access certain portions of the site, and we may not be able to
customize the site's features according to your preferences.
What we do with the information we collect
Aggregated Information (information that does not
personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may
combine information about your usage patterns with similar information
obtained from other users to help enhance our site, software and
services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared
with our business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information
collected on slax.org to communicate with you about your registration
and customization preferences; services and products offered by us and
other topics we think you might find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by the
website may also be used for other purposes, including
but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of
ecommerce transactions, and other communications with you. We will use
your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to
time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or
partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose
your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with
the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we
may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Changes to this Policy
We reserve the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
our site or software following the posting of changes to these terms
will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the
time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws
that applied at the time the information was collected.
