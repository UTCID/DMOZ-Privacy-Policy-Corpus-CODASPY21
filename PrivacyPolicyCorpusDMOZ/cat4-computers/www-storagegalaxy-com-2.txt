without prior notice.  If an item's correct price is greater than our listed price, we may, at our own
discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
Although Technology Galaxy does its best to stay
current, product pictures may not be representative of actual item being sold.
Products are based on the manufacturer part number they represent.
Pictures may sometimes show an item in a different color or quantity than the
part number actually represents.  Product pictures are meant to give the
customer an "idea" of the product and are not to be used solely to identify or
be an actual representation of the product.
15. Return Policy. Technology Galaxy follows a general
15-day return policy for returnable items.  It is the customers
responsibility to obtain an email from Technology Galaxy, stating the return
policy of an item, prior to purchase.  Technology Galaxy does NOT and CANNOT
accept RA# requests beyond 15-days from shipment date.  Technology
Galaxy bases its return policy on that of the manufacturer or Distributor of the
item.  Because of this, our return policies are subject to change at any time
and without prior notice, in order to stay consistent with the manufacturer or
Distributor.  In order to return an item, customers must obtain an RA# (Return
Authorization Number) as well as the proper "Ship To" address.  Returns
information may be obtained by sending an e-mail to
support@tekgalaxy.com.  A return request must be approved by Technology
Galaxy and the item shipped to the address specified in the Return
Authorization.  Approved returns are classified as defective or non-defective
and abide by the following terms:
Defective items:  Depending on the nature and extent of the
problem, all defective items will either be replaced by Technology Galaxy
directly, or the customer will be referred to the original manufacturer. Should
Technology Galaxy accept the defective return, a replacement item will be
shipped to the customer after the defective item is received, inspected and
approved by Technology Galaxy.  If the customer requests an immediate shipment
on the replacement item, Technology Galaxy will charge them the full amount,
including shipping.  The customer will then be refunded the cost of the
defective item minus original shipping charges, after the defective item is
received, inspected and approved by Technology Galaxy.  If a refund is requested
on a defective item, the customer will be refunded the original cost of the
defective item, minus shipping and a 15% restocking fee.  It is the customer's
responsibility to return the item to the address specified by Technology Galaxy in the
Return Authorization, at the customer's expense.  Technology Galaxy is not
responsible for any charges incurred by the customer in returning an item.
Non-Defective items:  Upon Technology Galaxy approval,
non-defective items may be returned for an exchange, store credit, or refund.
All approved, non-defective returns will be charged a 15% restocking fee.  The
customer will be refunded the original cost of the item, minus shipping and a
15% restocking fee.  It is the customer's responsibility to return the item to
the address specified by Technology Galaxy in the Return Authorization, at the
customer's expense.  Technology Galaxy is not responsible for any charges
incurred by the customer in returning an item.
In order to expedite the returns process, please be sure to
include the following items in your email:
Invoice #Company Name (if applicable)
Contact person
Please provide the Part Number as well as the quantity of all items
returned.
Reason(s) for return or exchange.
If the item is defective, please provide a detailed explanation of the
problem.
Indicate whether or not the package has been opened.
If the package has been opened, indicate if you have the original
manufacturer's box that the item(s) were shipped in?
If returning a defective item, indicate whether you would like a
replacement or refund.
The response time for RA# requests typically takes 24-48 hours.  Technology
Galaxy will not accept any return item(s) not in their original
manufacturer's box.  Should the customer not have the original box and
packaging materials, it is their responsibility to obtain such items from
the manufacturer at their own expense.   After obtaining the RA# and
shipping address, please take the following steps:
Package the ordered item(s) securely in their original box, along with all
packaging
materials.
DO NOT write on the box itself.  Shipping labels MUST be used.
Write the proper shipping address on the self-provided labels.  Remember, returns
without an RA# will NOT be accepted.
Please include your full name, address, and RA# on the return label.
The RA# must be written on the shipping label above the returns warehouse
address.
Ship return item(s) via UPS, FedEx, or other third-party carrier that
utilizes a
tracking system and offers insurance on shipped items.  Obtaining insurance from the carrier for the value of the item(s) in the
package is recommended.  Technology Galaxy is not responsible for any lost return
items/packages or any other damage that results from shipment to our
returns warehouse.  The customer must obtain and keep their tracking#
in a safe place until the return item(s) is/are received by our returns
warehouse.
After the RA# is issued, the item(s) must be returned within 15 days from
the date of issuance.  Returns will NOT be accepted after the 15 day
window from
the date the RA# was issued.
16. Refusal of Package. An order cancellation may not take place on an item that
has
already shipped. If a customer places an order and then refuses the package,
a 15% restocking fee will apply. The customer will then be re-credited for the return item(s)
less a 15% restocking fee and any shipping fees associated with the return(s).
17. Discontinued and phased-out items. Returns on discontinued or phased-out items will NOT be
accepted.  Return requests may only be submitted for active items.
18. Purchase of non-returnable items. Technology Galaxy does not accept any returns on (including but not limited to) non-defective, non-factory sealed memory modules, Laptops, Desktops, CPU's, other types of processors, laptop carrying cases/portfolio cases, laptop accessories, certain model scanners (such as Canon, Kodak and Panasonic), scanner accessories, certain model projectors, UPS accessories, cables, camera accessories, print supplies, printer accessories, processors, motherboards, keyboards, mice, modems, media, adapters, software, monitor accessories, storage accessories, hard drives, video cards and discontinued items. Certain items may only be exchanged or returned via the manufacturer, defective or non-defective:
This includes but is not limited to Panasonic and Canon Scanners, HP Printers, certain model laptops such as Lenovo, as well as discontinued products.
Contact Technology Galaxy to verify the return policy of an item, prior to purchasing.
It is the responsibility of the customer to obtain an email from Technology Galaxy, stating the return policy of any item they wish to order, prior to placing the order.
To submit a return request for the above-mentioned items, the item(s) MUST be unopened and factory sealed.
19. RA#'s issued for defective items or factory-sealed items.
If Technology Galaxy
finds a defective return to be non-defective, the item will be shipped back to the customer at
their expense. The same rule applies to RA#'s issued for factory-sealed
items. RA# will only be issued for items that are unopened and still in their
original packaging and seal.  If Technology Galaxy receives such an item
and finds that it was previously opened,
the item will be returned to the customer at their expense. Item(s) will not be returned to the customer
if the customer refuses to provide payment for the shipping fees to have the item(s) shipped back to their address.
If the customer
refuses to provide payment for shipping fees to have the item(s) shipped back to their address,then the customer agrees to surrender all right and title
to and give up all claims against Technology Galaxy for credit related to the unauthorized return item(s).
20. Customer Shipping Account Numbers.
Technology may use customer/end-user shipper account numbers at the request of the customer.
Such shipper account
usage will be at the sole discretion of Technology Galaxy.
Technology Galaxy cannot be held liable for any shipping costs associated with shipments shipped via a
customer's shipper account number.
Type of packaging and amounts of goods packaged in a box are at the sole discretion of our third party distributors and
thus, Technology Galaxy cannot be held liable for such shipping costs incurred as a result of our third party distributor's packing methods.
All shipping fees that are unbillable to the account provided by the
Customer, will be billed to the Customer separately, by Technology Galaxy.
Any unpaid shipping balance is due immediately upon receipt of invoice from
Technology Galaxy.
21. Carrier Non-Shipment/Return, Lost or Damaged Items. Orders returned or unshippable by the carrier shall be rerouted
(to address provided by customer) or returned to Technology Galaxy.
All shipping charges incurred for reroute or returned packages
shall be charged to the customer.
Losses or damages resultant from third party carriers will be replaced or refunded pending a claim
settlement by Technology Galaxy with the third party carrier, for the lost or damaged item(s). Should the claim be rejected by the third
party carrier, no replacement or refund would be issued by Technology Galaxy.
22. Prior Authorization. Technology Galaxy will not accept any return items without prior authorization.
YOU MUST FIRST OBTAIN AN RA# TO
RETURN AN ITEM.
If Technology Galaxy receives an unauthorized return, the item will be returned to
the customer at the customer's expense and the customer will be charged a $55 processing fee per shipment returned.
If the customer refuses the package with the unauthorized return items or if the customer returns the item(s)
to Technology Galaxy the second time without prior authorization, then the customer agrees to surrender all right and title
to and give up all claims against Technology Galaxy for credit related to the unauthorized return item(s).

Shipping to the Milky Way Planets
As long as that planet has life as we know it, we will find a way to get it there. It obviously won't qualify for free shipping as jet fuel is pretty expensive. Also, we cannot gaurantee 3-day delivery as we are still working on breaking light speed here at TechnologyGalaxy.com
