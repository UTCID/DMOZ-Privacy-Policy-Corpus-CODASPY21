However, every time our website is accessed, we automatically store access data (server log files), such as the name of your internet service provider, the operating system used, the website you visited us from, the date and duration of your visit and the name of the file accessed, as well the IP address of the computer used (for security reasons, such as to recognise attacks on our website) for a duration of 7 days. This data is solely evaluated for the purpose of improving our offering and does not enable conclusions to be drawn about you as a person. This data is not merged with other data sources. The legal basis for the processing of data is article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. We process and use the data for the following purposes: 1. to provide the website, 2. to improve our websites and 3. to prevent and identify errors/malfunctions and the abuse of the website. The processing enables us to pursue legitimate interests in ensuring the functionality of the website and its error-free, secure operation, as well as in adapting this website to suit users’ needs.Use of cookies (general, functionality, opt-out links etc.)We use ‘cookies’ on our website to make visiting our website more attractive and to enable certain functions to be used. The use of cookies serves our legitimate interest in making your visit to our website as pleasant as possible and is based on article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Cookies are standard internet technology used to store and retrieve login details and other usage information for all the users of a website. Cookies are small text files that are deposited on your end device. They enable us to store user settings, inter alia, to ensure that our website can be shown in a format tailored to your device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of a browser session, i.e. when you close your browser (known as ‘session cookies’). Other cookies remain on your end device and enable us or our partner companies to recognise your browser on your next visit (known as ‘persistent cookies’).You can set your browser so you are informed when cookies are to be stored and decide whether to accept them in each individual situation, to accept them under certain circumstances, or to exclude them in general. In addition, cookies can be retrospectively deleted to remove data that the website stored on your computer. Deactivating cookies (known as ‘opting out’) can limit our website’s functionality in some respects.Categories of data subjects: Website visitors, users of online servicesOpt-out:Internet Explorer: https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/17442Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/wie-verhindere-ich-dass-websites-mich-verfolgenGoogle Chrome: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=deSafari: https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201265  Legal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), legitimate interest (article 6 (1) (f) GDPR) 	The pertinent legal basis is specifically stated for each tool in question.Legitimate interests: Storing of opt-in preferences, presentation of the website, assurance of the website's functionality, provision of user status across the entire website, recognition for the next website visitors, user-friendly online offering, assurance of the chat functionWeb analysis and optimisationWe use tools for web analysis and reach measurement so that we can evaluate user flows to our online offering. To do so, we collect information about the behaviour, interests or demographics of our users, such as their age, gender, and so on. This helps us to recognise the times at which our online offering, its functions, and content are frequented the most or accessed more than once. In addition, we can use the information that has been collected to determine whether our online offering requires optimisation or adjustment.The information collected for this purpose is stored in cookies or deployed in similar procedures used for reach measurements and optimisation. The data stored in the cookies could include the content viewed, webpages visited, settings, and the functions and systems used. However, plain data from users is not normally processed for the above purposes. In this case, the data is changed so that the actual identity of the user is not known to us, nor the provider of the tool used. The changed data is often stored in user profiles.Categories of data subjects: Website visitors, users of online servicesData categories: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), contact data (e.g. email address, telephone number), content data (e.g. text inputs, photographs, videos)Purposes of processing: Website analyses, reach measurement, utilisation and assessment of website interaction, lead evaluationLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), legitimate interest (article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)Legitimate interests: Optimisation and further development of the website, increase in profits, customer loyalty and acquisitionGoogle OptimizeTool: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, IrelandPrivacy: https://policies.google.com/privacyOpt-out-link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de or https://myaccount.google.com/Legal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Online marketingWe process personal data within the framework of online marketing, particularly regarding potential interests and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing measures, with the aim of continually boosting our reach and the prominence of our online offering.We store the relevant information in cookies or use similar procedures for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of our marketing measures and identifying potential interests.

However, plain data from users is not normally processed for the above purposes. If so, the data is changed so that the actual identity of the user is not known to us, nor the provider of the tool used. The changed data is often stored in user profiles.In the event that user profiles are stored, the data can be used, read, supplemented, and expanded on the server of the online marketing procedure when other online offerings are visited that use the same online marketing procedure.We can calculate the success of our adverts using summarised data that is made available to us by the provider of the online marketing procedure (known as ‘conversion measurement’). As part of these conversion measurements, we can trace whether a marketing measure caused a visitor to our online offering to decide to make a purchase. This evaluation serves to analyse the success of our online marketing.Categories of data subjects: Website visitors, users of online services, prospective customers, communication partners, business partners and contractual partnersData categories: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), location data, contact data (e.g. email address, telephone number), content data (e.g. text inputs, photographs, videos)Purposes of processing: Marketing (sometimes interest-based and behavioural, as well), conversion measurement, target group formation, click tracking, development of marketing strategies and increase in the efficiency of campaignsLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), legitimate interest (article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)Legitimate interests: Optimisation and further development of the website, increase in profits, customer loyalty and acquisition,Google Tag ManagerTool: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, IrelandPrivacy: https://policies.google.com/privacyOpt-out-link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de  or https://myaccount.google.com/Legal base: Legitimate interest (article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)Legitimate interests: Coordination of different tools, management, easy handling and representationGoogle AnalyticsTool: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, IrelandPrivacy: https://policies.google.com/privacyOpt-out-link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de or https://myaccount.google.com/Legal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)econda AnalyticsTool: econda GmbH, Zimmerstr. 6, 76137 Karlsruhe, GermanyPrivacy: https://www.econda.de/datenschutzhinweise/Opt-out-link: https://www.econda.de/widerruf-zur-datenspeicherung/Legal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Google AdWords and conversion measurementTool: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, IrelandPrivacy: https://policies.google.com/privacyOpt-out-link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de or https://myaccount.google.com/Legal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Facebook-PixelTool: Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, IrelandPrivacy: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanationOpt-out-link: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=adsLegal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)LinkedInTool: LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USAPrivacy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=homepage-basic_footer-privacy-policyOpt-out-link: https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-outLegal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Microsoft AdvertisingTool: Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USAPrivacy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatementOpt-out-link: https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout?ru=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprivacy%2Fad-settingsLegal base: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Presence on social mediaWe maintain online presences on social networks and career platforms so we can exchange information with users registered there and easily contact them.Sometimes, data belonging to social network users is used for market research and, by extension, for advertising purposes. Users’ usage behaviour, such as their stated interests, can lead to user profiles being created and used in order to adapt adverts to suit the interests of the target group. To this end, cookies are normally stored on users’ end devices, which sometimes occurs regardless of whether you are a registered user of the social network.In conjunction with the use of social media, we also make use of the associated messenger services to communicate easily with users. We would like to point out that the security of some services can depend on the user's account settings. Even in cases of end-to-end encryption, the service provider can draw conclusions about the fact that the user is communicating with us, when they do so, and, on occasion, capture location data.Depending on where the social network is operated, the user data can be processed outside the European Union or outside the European Economic Area. This can lead to risks for users because it is more difficult for them to assert their rights, for example.Categories of data subjects: Registered users and non-registered users of the social networkData categories: Master data (e.g. name, address), contact data (e.g. email address, telephone number), content data (e.g. text inputs, photographs, videos), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses)Purposes of processing: Increase in the reach, networking of usersLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR), legitimate interest (article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)Legitimate interests: Interaction and communication on social media pages, increase in profits, findings regarding target groupsInstagramTool: Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, IrelandPrivacy: https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875 and https://www.facebook.com/about/privacyOpt-out-link: https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/accounts/privacy_and_security/FacebookTool: Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, IrelandPrivacy: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation und https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendumOpt-out-link:https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=adsLinkedInTool: LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USAPrivacy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policyOpt-out-link: https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-outKununuTool: New Work SE, Dammtorstr. 30, 20354 Hamburg, GermanyPrivacy: https://privacy.xing.com/de/datenschutzerklaerungSlideShareTool: LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USAPrivacy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policyOpt-out-link: https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-outTwitterTool: Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02 AX07 IrelandPrivacy: https://twitter.com/de/privacyOpt-out-link: https://help.twitter.com/de/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies#privacy-optionsYouTubeTool: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, IrelandPrivacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de&gl=deOpt-out-link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de oder https://myaccount.google.com/XingTool: New Work SE, Dammtorstraße 30, 20354 Hamburg, GermanyPrivacy: https://privacy.xing.com/de/datenschutzerklaerungPlug-ins and integrated third-party contentWe have integrated functions and content obtained from third-party providers into our online offering. For example, videos, depictions, buttons or contributions (hereinafter termed ‘content’) can be integrated.To enable visitors to our online offering to be shown content, the third-party provider in question processes the user’s IP address, inter alia, to transmit the content to the browser and display it. It is not possible to integrate third-party content without this processing taking place.Sometimes, additional information is collected via ‘pixel tags’ or web beacons through which the third-party provider receives information about the use of the content or visitor traffic to our online offering, technical information about the user's browser or operating system, the visit time or referring websites. The data collected in this manner is stored in cookies on the user’s end device.

We only send newsletters to recipients who have agreed to receive the newsletter, and within the framework of statutory provisions.An email address must be provided to subscribe to our newsletter. If applicable, we collect extra data, such as to include a personal greeting in our newsletter.Our newsletter is only sent after the ‘double opt-in procedure’ has been fully completed. If visitors to our online offering decide to receive our newsletter, they will receive a confirmation email that serves to prevent the fraudulent input of wrong email addresses and preclude a single, possibly accidental, click from causing the newsletter to be sent. The subscription to our newsletter can be ended at any time with future effect. An unsubscription (opt-out) link is given at the end of every newsletter.In addition, we are obliged to provide proof that our subscribers actually want to receive the newsletter. To this end, we collect and store their IP address, along with the time of subscription and unsubscription.Our newsletters are designed so that we can obtain findings about improvements, target groups or the reading behaviour of our subscribers. We are able to do this thanks to a 'web beacon’ or tracking pixel that reacts to interactions with the newsletter, such as looking at whether links are clicked on, whether the newsletter is opened at all, or at what time the newsletter is read. If we have been given a separate consent for tracking in our newsletter (so-called tracking permission), we can draw conclusions about the usage behaviour of our newsletter subscribers. The tracking permission can be withdrawn separately, i.e. without withdrawing the consent for the subscription of the newsletter itself. Without a tracking permission we cannot draw any conclusions about the usage behaviour of individual subscribers.Categories of data subjects: Newsletter subscribersData categories: Master data (e.g. name, address), contact data (e.g. email address, telephone number), metadata and communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times)Purposes of processing: Marketing, increase in customer loyalty and new customer acquisition, analysis and evaluation of the campaigns’ successLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Advertising communicationsWe also use data provided to us for advertising purposes, particularly to provide information on various channels about new products from us or in our portfolio of offerings.

This also includes the data that we need to tell the winners the outcome and distribute the prize.Depending on the type of competition, contributions by or about the participants may be published, such as reports on the competition in question or if a vote on a contribution submitted by the participant forms part of the competition. The participant’s name will also be published as part of this. The data processed in each individual case depends on the competition actually run and the data we receive from the participant.If competition in question is run on our page on a social network, this is also subject to the usage conditions and data protection provisions of the network in question.Categories of data subjects: ParticipantsData categories: Master data (e.g. name, address), contact data (e.g. email address, telephone number), content data (e.g. text inputs, photographs, videos)Purposes of processing: Implementation of competitions, incl. disbursement of prizes and announcement of the winners in various mediaLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Contacting usOn our online offering, we offer the option of contacting us directly or requesting information via various contact options.

In this case, consent is obtained via a double-opt-in procedure both for the processing of user data for the download and separately for the subscription to download-related mailings, which are each freely withdrawable separately.The download then takes place via a download link, which we provide to our users by e-mail.Categories of data subjects: Interested persons who specifically download our information materialData categories: IP address, form-data (form of address, name, email address, telephone number)Purposes of processing: Marketing, acquisition of new customers, sales increaseLegal bases: Consent (article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)Data transferWe transfer the personal data of visitors to our online offering for internal purposes (e.g. for internal administration or to the HR department so we can meet statutory or contractual obligations). Internal data transfer or the disclosure of data only occurs to the extent necessary, under the pertinent data protection provisions.We transfer data to countries outside the EEA (known as ‘third countries’). This occurs due to the above-mentioned purposes (transfer within the group and/or to other recipients). Transfer is only effected to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations, or on the basis of the consent that the data subject granted prior to this. In addition, this transfer takes place in compliance with the applicable data protection laws, and particularly in accordance with article 44 ff. GDPR, especially on the basis of adequacy decisions made by the European Commission or certain guarantees (e.g. standard protection clauses etc.).Storage periodIn principle, we store the data of visitors to our online offering for as long as needed to render our service or to the extent that the European body issuing directives and regulations or another legislator stipulates in laws and regulations to which we are subject. In all other cases, we delete personal data once the purpose has been fulfilled, with the exception of data that we need to continue to store to comply with legal obligations (e.g. if retention periods under tax law and trade law require us to keep documents such as contracts and invoices for a certain period of time).Automated decision-makingWe do not use automated decision-making or profiling.Legal basesThe decisive legal bases primarily arise from the GDPR. They are supplemented by national laws from member states and can, if applicable, be applied alongside or in addition to the GDPR.Consent: Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing procedures regarding which we have sought consent for a particular purpose of processing.Performance of a contract: Article 6 (1) (b) serves as the legal basis for processing required to perform a contract to which the data subject is a contractual party or for taking steps prior to entering into a contract, at the request of the data subject.Legal obligation: Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR is the legal basis for processing that is required to comply with a legal obligation.Vital interests: Article 6 (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.Public interest: Article 6 (1) (e) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing that is necessary to perform a task in the public interest or to exercise public force that is transferred to the controller.Legitimate interest: Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing that is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided this is not outweighed by the interests or fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject that require personal data to be protected, particularly if the data subject is a child.Rights of the data subjectRight of access: Pursuant to article 15 GDPR, data subjects have the right to request confirmation as to whether we process data relating to them. They can request access to their data, along with the additional information listed in article 15 (1) GDPR and a copy of their data.Right to rectification: Pursuant to article 16 GDPR, data subjects have the right to request that data relating to them, and that we process, be rectified or completed.Right to erasure: Pursuant to article 17 GDPR, data subjects have the right to request that data relating to them be erased without delay. Alternatively, they can request that we restrict the processing of their data, pursuant to article 18 GDPR.Right to data portability: Pursuant to article 20 GDPR, data subjects have the right to request that data made available to us by them be provided and transferred to another controller.Right to lodge a complaint: In addition, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority responsible for them, under article 77 GDPR.Right to object: If personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to article 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR, under article 21 GDPR data subjects have the right to object to the processing of their personal data, provided there are reasons for this that arise from their particular situation or the objection relates to direct advertising. In the latter case, data subjects have a general right to object that is to be put into effect by us without a particular situation being stated.Withdrawal of consentSome data processing procedures can only be carried out with the express consent of the data subject. Once granted, you are able to withdraw consent at any time. To do so, sending an informal note or email to datenschutz@inxmail.de is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the point of withdrawal shall remain unaffected by the withdrawal.External linksOur website includes links to online offerings from other providers. We note that we have no influence over the content of the online offerings linked to and over whether their providers comply with data protection provisions.AmendmentsWe reserve the right to amend this information on data protection, in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions, if changes are made to our online offering so that it complies with the legal requirements.This Privacy Policy was drawn up by the Deutsche Datenschutzkanzlei – Tettnang office
