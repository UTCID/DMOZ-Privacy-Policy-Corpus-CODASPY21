that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by
that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall
continue in full force and effect. Any failure by Kaizen
Software Solutions to enforce or exercise any provision
of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute
a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles
used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and
carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
