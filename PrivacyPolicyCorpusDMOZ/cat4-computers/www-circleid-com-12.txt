Privacy Policy
CircleID believes in your right to privacy and is committed to the use of
fair information practices on the Internet. This CircleID Privacy Statement
applies to CircleID's website at www.CircleID.com (the "CircleID Site") and the
services offered via the CircleID Site (the "CircleID Services"). By using the
CircleID Site and/or the CircleID Services (collectively, "CircleID
Site/Services"), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement.
Types of Information Collected
Personal Information. When you register to become a member of
CircleID, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. Examples of
the personal information that we collect include your name, email address,
professional biography and occupation.
IP Addresses. An Internet protocol address ("IP address") is the
unique number that identifies the computer you are using to browse the Internet.
CircleID uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the CircleID Site, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Disclosure and Use of Information Collected
Information Provided During Registration. The information you provide us when
registering as a member of CircleID is publicly available on the CircleID Site
as part of your member profile.
This means that your member profile may be viewed by other members and
visitors of CircleID. You may choose to opt-out of this public disclosure of
your member profile by contacting us. You
may change or edit information about yourself in your member profile at any time
using your account settings.
Posted Information. The CircleID Site allows you to post information
in public forums. Any information you voluntarily disclose through this medium
is necessarily disclosed to the public.
Email and Promotional Materials. We send all new members a welcome
email to verify password and username. In addition CircleID publishes a weekly
email newsletter. This service is optional and may be
administrated from the member account settings.
Links
The CircleID Site may contain images of and links to third party websites
("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of CircleID and
CircleID is not responsible for the content of any Linked Site. Use of
information collected at Linked Sites is subject to any privacy policies at
those sites.
Data From Children
CircleID does not collect data from individuals that identify themselves as
children under the age of thirteen, and the CircleID Site/Services are not
intended for use by children under the age of thirteen. If CircleID becomes
aware that it has received information from a child under the age of thirteen,
we will delete all personally identifiable information concerning that child
from our records.
Security
CircleID wants your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably
possible. CircleID secures the personal information you provide on computer
servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access.
When highly confidential information, such as a credit card number, is
transmitted over the Internet, it is protected through the use of encryption,
such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Privacy Statement
The CircleID Privacy Statement is subject to change at any time. If any
material changes are made to this Privacy Statement, it will be posted here. By
using the site after any such announcement, you agree to the terms of the
amended Privacy Statement.
