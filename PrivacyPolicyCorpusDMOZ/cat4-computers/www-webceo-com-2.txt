5. Terms of Payment and Refunds
The Service is provided to registered users based on a selected subscription to a paid Service Plan. When users upgrade from a free Service Plan to any paid Service Plan, they agree to pay all applicable fees, including one-time or recurring fees incurred in connection with the projects of the Service account at the prices effective at the time a subscription is bought.
All subscriptions are billed in the Billing section of the Service Website where a registered user provides personal and credit card details. All transactions are processed via a Secured Socket Layer connection with 256 bit encryption, providing you with the highest level of security. WebCEO shall charge a user's credit card in accordance with the following rules:
The billing period shall be 1 month, 3 months or 12 months and shall be selected by the Service users upon changing their Service Plan.
When users upgrade from a free Service Plan to any paid Service Plan, an invoice shall be issued and their credit card shall be charged automatically upon upgrading and on the first day of every following 1-month, 3-month or 12-month billing period to renew their subscription to a current paid Service Plan for a subsequent billing period.
When users upgrade their current Service Plan to the Agency Unlimited Service Plan, an invoice shall be issued and their credit card shall be charged automatically upon upgrading and on the first day of every following 1-month, 3-month or 12-month billing period to renew their subscription to the Agency Unlimited Service Plan for a subsequent billing period.On the first day of every subsequent month, starting from the date of upgrading to the Agency Unlimited Service Plan, their credit card shall be also charged to pay the active project fees and scanning costs that were incurred during the previous month according to the cost specifications for the Agency Unlimited Service Plan given in the Billing section of the Service Website.
When users downgrade or upgrade their current paid Service Plan before the subscription to it expires, an unused portion of the subscription fee, if any, shall be credited to their Service account to be further paid for any Service fees and charges.
Any upgrade or downgrade of a Service Plan shall go into effect immediately.
If there are insufficient funds on the Service account and/or on a user's credit card to renew a subscription to the current Service Plan for another billing period and/or to pay the active project fees and scanning costs of the Agency Unlimited Service plan incurred during the preceding month, WebCEO shall establish a grace period of 14 (fourteen) days to give its users time to provide sufficient funds on their Service account or credit card.On every day of the 14-day grace period, WebCEO shall try to charge a user's credit card for a due amount completely or partially, unless a due invoice is fully paid. WebCEO shall continue attempting to renew a subscription to the current Service Plan until the end of the 14-day grace period. If during the 14-day grace period a due invoice was not paid, WebCEO shall suspend the user’s current paid Service Plan. All projects of such user shall become inactive with a Read Only access to tools and features. The suspended projects and reports shall not be deleted.
All charges to your credit card are reflected in the Service invoices that can be found in the Billing history of the Billing section of the Service Website.
Users of any paid Service Plan can get an unconditional refund of their Service Plan fee for the last 30 days of service. The Agency Unlimited active project fees and scanning costs are nonrefundable. All refund requests that go beyond the aforementioned conditions will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
6. Account Deletion
Your account and subscription of the Service remains in effect unless you cancel it or unless WebCEO terminates your account as provided by these Terms. You may cancel your account by contacting our customer support team at support@webceo.com.
