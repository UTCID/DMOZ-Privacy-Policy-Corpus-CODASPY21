WHOIS Privacy Protection
Your free shield against spam and identity theft.
The governing body for domain names, ICANN, requires all websites to provide valid contact information (WHOIS) for public availability.
This puts your personal information at risk because anyone, including spammers and telemarketers, can get your information with a simple WHOIS search for your domain.
WHOIS Privacy Protection allows you to use contact information provided by a third party instead. This satisfies ICANN requirements and keeps your real information hidden.
