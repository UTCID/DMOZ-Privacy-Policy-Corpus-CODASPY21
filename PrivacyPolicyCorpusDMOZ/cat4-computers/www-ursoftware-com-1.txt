of URSoft,Inc' privacy policy are as follows:
Information Collection
When you engage in activities on our Web site like ordering
or registering products, downloading trial versions of software
or software updates, requesting technical support, or signing
up for special offers or newsletters, URSoft may ask you to provide
us with information. Information we ask you to provide when purchasing
or ordering will only be the information necessary to process
your purchase or order. When fulfilling an order we will ask for
your name, email address, address (for shipping purposes), telephone
number and credit card number, type and expiration date. We will
use this information only for matters related to your order unless
you request otherwise. Your credit card information will be maintained
only for a period reasonably necessary to ensure payment has been
received.
Additional information we may ask you to provide when choosing
to engage in other activities on our website or within our products
may include name, mailing address, telephone number, facsimile
numbers, e-mail address, and other demographic information that
will enable us to better understand the requirements of our customers
and to continue to provide high quality products and service.
This information request will be optional and required only to
engage in certain activities.  By choosing to enter the requested
information when prompted, you may be eligible to receive demonstration
versions of new software, extended functionality, user tips and
product information, newsletters and special offers.
Any information you post to a chat room or public bulletin
is available to all users of that site.
How We Use Your Information
Any information collected will be used only by URSoft,Inc
to improve our products, services and website.  URSoft,Inc
uses information for internal purposes only and does not sell,
lease or rent information to third parties.
URSoft,Inc may use information it has collected to provide
you with notices which you indicate would be of use or interest
to you.  This may include notice of an ability to extend
a products trial period, newsletters, website update notices,
notification of the availability of new products, product updates
as well as information on promotions and special offers.
You will be entitled to elect not to receive any further notices.
If you enter into a trial period of URSoft software, we may
contact you via email to provide additional information on our
products and to survey you on your satisfaction with our software.
We may also contact you to provide advance notice of termination
of the trial period. Email is our preferred method of communication
and we value the privilege to use it.
URSoft,Inc may profile Web site activity and compile data in
aggregate form in order to better understand user activities and
the success of various ad campaigns.  This information is
important to us as it enables us to continue to provide products
specific to our customer's interests.   Site visitor
behavior information is compiled in aggregate and does not represent
individually identifiable information.
URSoft,Inc may hire certain outside contractors to perform
services on our behalf (such as packaging & shipping).
We will only provide those companies the personal information
they need to complete the desired service.  They are not
permitted to use customer information for any other purpose.

third parties who are select partners of URSoft,Inc.  URSoft,Inc
