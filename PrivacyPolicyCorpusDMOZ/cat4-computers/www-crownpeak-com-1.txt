Get the edge on your competition with the best customer experience tools for CCPA compliance
What the California Consumer Privacy Act means to your organization
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a new law designed to empower California residents with more transparency into and control over their personal data. The CCPA requires any organization doing digital business in California to disclose what personal information is being collected and which third-parties that data is being shared with. The CCPA also requires a way for consumers to access and opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
With a January 1, 2020 effective date and 12-month “look-back” period, businesses are now under pressure to incorporate the new requirements into their digital presence.
