The Aardvark Privacy Policy
To put it bluntly -- any information you submit through this site
is held in total confidence unless otherwise stated.
Aardvark has built a strong reputation for protecting the information submitted
and collected.
I have a total anti-spam, anti UCE policy -- never, never, never
will your email address be made available to any third party without your
expressed permission and never, never, never will I send you unsolicited
email.
That's it ... plain and simple -- Your secrets are safe with me!
What's more -- Aardvark doesn't routinely collect information from its
users.
Apart from the Google Ads, this site is a cookie-free zone --
I probably know nothing at all about you anyway!
Here's a whole bunch of stuff about Google's cookie and privacy policy that
You might find interesting and which I'm supposed to include in this
privacy statement as part of my position as an AdSense user
If you've got a problem or a query about this then
contact me,
you can even do it anonymously but in that case
don't expect a reply (how could I?).
