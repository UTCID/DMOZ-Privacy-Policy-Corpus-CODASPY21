Quickly and reliably link file transfers with a wide variety of related business processes
Years of adding one-off file transfer connections to meet a specific need often equals a complex environment that lacks the flexibility, reliability, security and traceability needed to support all your business scenarios and compliance requirements.
As a multi-protocol MFT gateway, SecureTransport provides the flexibility you need to support virtually any MFT use case. Perform high-volume automated file transfers between systems, sites, lines of business and external partners, and implement user-driven communications and mobile, folder- and portal-based file sharing.
