The contractual Agreements in force governing handling of client data are always adhered to and dictate that data is never shared with any third party without express written consent of the customer. Furthermore, InhabitIQ customer data is never shared outside of the brand providing service for any purpose other than improving internal business operations and cross-marketing our solutions to existing InhabitIQ customers.
