Miscellaneous
This Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. If any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior writings, negotiations or understandings with respect thereto. This Agreement will not be amended or supplemented by the preprinted terms or conditions on any purchase order, acknowledgment or other business form employed by either party. Except as set forth herein, no modification or addition to this Agreement will have any effect unless it is set forth in writing and signed by both parties. DomainsBot is not responsible for any offense you perceive in the meaning – in English or in different languages including slang versions of those languages – of the suggestions returned by our system. These suggestions are automatically generated based on linguistic patterns and, because language includes terms some people find offensive, suggestions may at time contain language considered offensive by some. The system uses an adult filter, which is turned on by default. This filter may not remove every word you consider offensive and may not exclude terms to your satisfaction in every case.
Registration of domain names
DomainsBot has partnerships with various registrars for the purpose of registering domain names. Your agreement with the registrar who registers your domain names will govern your rights and obligations when you register domain names.
Customer Postings
We reserve the right to edit or refuse to publish any and all postings our customers may attempt to make to parts of our site dedicated to featuring customer comments or reviews.
