(also referred to as SmartWebby). This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by us when you access our site and services (including through the websites of our partners), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy includes our Cookie Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. The use of information collected through our website shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service to customers.
The Information We Collect

from you:
1) specific information you voluntarily submit, and
2) general information our site gathers automatically.
Specific Information You
Submit
If you download or buy a SmartWebby.com product/service or email SmartWebby for any reason, the information
in your email will only be used by us to contact you directly.
Information Use: We will keep your information on file only for the purpose you signed up for or for
providing pre and post sales service. As an existing customer we might contact you with information about other products and services you might find interesting. You will be given the option to unsubscribe from these automated emails.
We use a third party credit card processor so we do not store sensitive
financial information. The credit card processor we use (PayPal) is secure and provides information to SmartWebby about whether the charge transaction was approved or not.
We will never willfully disclose any individually identifiable
information to any
third parties without a user's
specific permission to do so. We do not sell users' names
or email addresses to other companies. We will only provide
individually identifiable information to third parties
