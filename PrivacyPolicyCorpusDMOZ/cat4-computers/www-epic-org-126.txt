Before the Federal Trade Commission
Washington, DC 20580 In the Matter of Microsoft Consent Order
FTC File No. 0123240, M03
To: The Commission COMMENTS OF THE ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER (EPIC);
U.S. PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP; REMAR SUTTON, PRESIDENT, THE CONSUMER
TASK FORCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE ISSUES; JUNKBUSTERS CORP; COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS
FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY; PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL; CONSUMERS UNION; CENTER
FOR DIGITAL DEMOCRACY; AND THE MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT.
September 9, 2002
Pursuant to the notice [1]
published by the Federal Trade Commission
on August 8, 2002 regarding the Consent Order entered into by the Microsoft
Corporation and the Commission, EPIC; U.S. Public Interest Research Group
(U.S. PIRG); Remar Sutton, President, The Consumer Task Force For Automotive
Issues; Junkbusters Corp; Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility;
Privacy International; Consumers Union; Center for Digital Democracy; and
the Media Access Project submit the following comments. We commend the Commission for taking action in this case.  The Consent Order
negotiated by the Commission broadly requires that Microsoft, through any
authentication system offered in the future, build in protections for the
use of personal information, including e-mail addresses, persistent identifiers
in cookies, and identifiers that are embedded in hardware.  Microsoft must
fully disclose its information collection and use practices.  Microsoft must
develop a comprehensive security program that incorporates administrative,
technical, and physical safeguards.  Microsoft must obtain third-party review
of its security program.  Microsoft must maintain its public relations and
marketing materials of Passport for Commission review.  Microsoft and its
successors must comply with these requirements for twenty years.
We believe that the Consent Order will go far in improving security and privacy
practices associated with the Microsoft Passport Service.  However, privacy
hazards continue to remain in the Passport system. [2]   Since we filed our original complaint
in July 2001, there have been a series of security breaches at Microsoft,
some of which involved Passport services. [3]   Additionally, a recent Gartner
study found that consumers are resistant to authentication systems, and that
a majority of Passport users enrolled simply because Passport was necessary
for access to some other service. [4]   Despite these facts, Microsoft has attempted to
expand Passport into an authentication system for credit card purchases,
[5]
and government entities have considered using Passport as an
authentication agent for e-gov services. [6]
To ensure effective implementation of the Consent Order, we make four recommendations: First, we recommend that since the intent of the Commission is to protect
consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, the Commission should modify
the consent order so as to require more transparency from Microsoft.  Additional
transparency is needed to ensure that consumers have adequate information
about security and privacy risks in the Passport system.
Second, we recommend that the Commission examine authentication systems that
are deployed and under development. Third, we recommend that the Commission ensure that Microsoft is complying
with the EU-US Safe Harbor, and that specifically, access to the entire Passport
profile for correction and deletion is possible. Last, we call upon the Commission to strengthen the security program for
Microsoft by limiting the Passport system.  Without limitations on the functions
that Passport performs and the information that Passport collects, Passport
becomes an increasingly attractive and lucrative target for malicious crackers. I.            Effective Implementation Requires Greater Transparency. To ensure effective implementation, transparency is needed so that individuals
and public policy makers can evaluate Microsoft's commitment to privacy and
security.  The FTC Consent Order requires Microsoft to engage in biannual
assessments certifying the company's security program.  We recommend that
this report be made public for review.  Without a publicly available report,
individuals will not be able to evaluate Microsoft's representations regarding
privacy and security.  Specifically, the Commission should add language in
section III of the Consent Order to read: "The report required by this
paragraph should be available to the public by request, and online via prominent
links on the Microsoft Passport website." Further, we commend the FTC for requiring the report to be made by "a
qualified, objective, independent third-party professional."
[7]   It should be noted that during the investigation, Truste certified
Microsoft's privacy policies.
[8]   Microsoft is a corporate sponsor of Truste, and has membership
on the organization's board of directors.
[9]   Because of the relationship between Microsoft and Truste,
and because Truste certified a privacy policy that was found to have contained
material misrepresentations, we recommend that Microsoft be required to employ
a different company to conduct the assessment and report.  For purposes of
performing the assessment, we believe that Truste fails to meet the "objective"
and "independent" criteria set forth in the Consent Order. Also consistent with principles of transparency, Microsoft should make available
to Passport account holders their entire profile.  Access should include the
ability to view and correct information provided by the user, information
collected by the system (such as authentication logs), and information that
is acquired to enhance users' profiles.  Specifically, we recommend that the
Commission add a section to the Consent Order requiring that: "Microsoft
shall provide to users access to their full Passport profile for inspection,
correction, and deletion.  Accessible information should include user-submitted
information, access logs or other information automatically associated with
an individual's Passport, and information that Microsoft uses to enhance Passport
profiles." [10]
It is important that users of Microsoft XP or other Microsoft products be
notified that a Passport is not necessary to access the Internet.  Representations
programmed into the Windows XP registration process are likely to lead individuals
into believing that a Passport is necessary for accessing the Internet.  We
recommend in order to ensure effective compliance, and to maximize the value
of notice to individuals, that Microsoft state clearly that a Passport is
an optional service not necessary for Internet use.  Specifically, we recommend
that the Commission add a subsection to section I prohibiting Microsoft from
misrepresenting in any manner, expressly or by implication, "whether
enrollment in Passport is necessary to access the Internet or Internet-related
services." II.  The Commission Should Examine Other Online Authentication Systems.
While Microsoft Passport was the focus of this investigation, we recommend
that the Commission examine other authentication systems currently in development.
As noted above, Consumers have been resistant to online authentication systems.
However, companies with business models dependent on the exploitation of individuals'
personal data continue to develop the systems and urge users to enroll, despite
public resistance. [11]
America Online has launched the "Screen Name Service," which tracks
users using personally identifiable information.
[12]   Users of the newly released Netscape 7 browser are urged
to enroll in AOL's Screen Name Service, which employs prompts for personal
information that are similar to the tactics used in the Windows XP operating
system.  Upon installation of the new browser, Netscape users are urged to
create a screenname.  The registration dialog box does not indicate that creating
a screenname is optional.  The dialog box only gives two options: "next"
and "cancel."  Individuals may be misled by these options, believing
that selecting "cancel" will result in rending the browser inoperable.
Individuals who enroll in the Screen Name Service are required to share personal
information, including name, e-mail address, sex, date of birth, country,
and zip code.
"Project Liberty" is an online identification and authentication
system that is being developed by a consortium of companies.
[13]   It is similar to the Microsoft Passport system in that it
allows individuals to use a single signon in order to access many different
web pages. [14]
Authentication systems enable profiling, which results in more spam, direct
mail, and telemarketing for individuals. Project Liberty has a stated goal
of profiling individuals. The Liberty Alliance web page claims that the service
is designed to: "Enable commercial and noncommercial organizations to
realize new revenue and cost saving opportunities that economically leverage
their relationships with customers, business partners, and employees."
[15]
The phrase "leverage their relationships" is a euphemism
for secondary use of personal information for new forms of marketing and profiling. Both AOL's Screen Name Service and Project Liberty present the same privacy
hazards as Microsoft Passport.  Accordingly, we recommend that the Commission
examine these systems, and that the Consent Order set a minimum standard for
privacy protection for these deployed and developed authentication systems. III.       The EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement Requires Access to the Entire
Passport Profile. Microsoft self-certified its compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles
and intention to join the Safe Harbor on June 29, 2001.
[16]   The Safe Harbor Privacy Principles require that U.S. organizations
seeking the protection of the Safe Harbor agree to follow certain doctrines
of personal privacy protection in seven areas.  Access to the entire Passport
profile is required under the EU-US Safe Harbor Principles.  The principles
require a right of access for correction or deletion. [17]   Currently, individuals have access to self-reported
information in the Passport profile, but they do not have access to authentication
or other logs that build profiles on Passport users.  Accordingly, we recommend
that the FTC should require Microsoft to provide access to profiles under
the Safe Harbor to European Union citizens.
IV.            Effective Implementation of the Security Program Requires
Limitations on Passport. The security weaknesses of a single signon identification and authentication
protocol have been well documented. [18]   These weaknesses
have also been demonstrated in a series of security breaches that threatened
users' computers and their personal information.  We believe that these security
breaches will continue to occur, and accordingly, a security program for Passport
must minimize the damage to individuals that these breaches will cause. [19]   The harm from these security
breaches could be mitigated if Microsoft developed genuine Privacy Enhancing
Technologies (PETs)—tools that limit or stop the collection of personal information.
Since Microsoft has adopted a profiling business model that depends on the
collection of personal information instead, the Commission should require
the company to develop a security program that mitigates risks to Passport
users. In the area of authentication, less harm would result from security breaches
if Microsoft limited the functions that Passport serves.  Currently, Passport
is the functional equivalent of using a single key for one's house, car, and
safe deposit box.  As Passport serves more functions, it becomes a more attractive
and more lucrative target for malicious crackers.
Microsoft has relied on a business model that requires personal information
for unnecessary purposes, such as simply logging in on a website.  Since the
company requires individuals to reveal their personal information for access
to services, the Commission should limit the functions that Passport serves
and limit the amount of information the service collects in order to maximize
the effectiveness of the security program.  We recommend adding a section
to the Consent Order specifying that: "Microsoft shall minimize requirements
for authentication.  Where Microsoft requires authentication, the company
shall state the reasons for which authentication is necessary." Risk of privacy violations would also be mitigated if the Passport system
accepted pseudonymous or anonymous authentication.  A Passport that contains
less personal information carries with it a diminished risk to the individual.
Currently, a fully populated Passport facilitates the sharing of name, e-mail
address, date of birth, country, and zip code.  Sharing this personal information
puts the individual at greater risk for identity theft, as date of birth is
often used as an authenticator for credit purposes.  We recommend adding a
section to the Consent Order that requires Microsoft to: "Incorporate
techniques for anonymity and pseudoanonymity that would allow users of Passport
to authenticate without revealing their true identity." Individuals' privacy would be further protected if the security program required
regular data destruction, so that the Passport database does not contain a
comprehensive log of user authentications.  We recommend adding a section
to the Consent Order specifying that: "Individually-identifiable data
collected by the Passport system shall be purged regularly.  This shall include
user data stored on back-up systems." The security program would also be strengthened if the Commission closely
monitored and remedied Microsoft's future security breaches.
[20]   We recommend that the Commission require Microsoft to notify
the agency whenever a security breach results in an unauthorized transfer
of personal information.  Those affected by the security breach should also
be promptly notified.  Accordingly, we recommend adding a section to the Consent
Order specifying that: "Microsoft shall notify the Commission as soon
as practicably possible following a breach of security that results in user
data being compromised.  Microsoft shall also notify Passport holders affected
by the breach."
