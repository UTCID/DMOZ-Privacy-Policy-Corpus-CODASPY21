SPAM policy:
Mesh Factory does not send out unsolicited email of any kind. We respect
our website visitors' privacy and do not wish to clutter anyone's email
inbox with advertisements of any kind. We feel the only legitimate
reason for any company to send out mass email advertisements is when the
product that is being advertised is of such poor quality, that it
cannot be marketed any other way successfully. We feel that this
definitely does not describe Mesh Factory products.
