A Special Note For Parents concerning PrivacyElite Designs asks that children under 13 years of age not submit personal information through this site and encourages all children to consult with their parents before furnishing personal information on this site or any other site on the Internet. Technology is not currently available, however, that would enable Elite Designs to restrict children under 13 from submitting personal information without unduly limiting the ability of other visitors to interact with us. Consequently, we suggest that parents supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers (e.g. Net Nanny). Among other things, these tools can prevent children from disclosing personal information online without parental permission.Submissions & Third-Party Content DisclaimerYou agree that nothing submitted by you to the Site shall contain any content which: a) libels, defames, invades privacy, or is obscene, pornographic, abusive, or threatening; b) infringes any intellectual property or other right of any entity or person, including, but not limited to violating anyone's copyrights or trademarks; c) violates any law; d) advocates illegal activity; or, e) advertises or otherwise solicits funds or is a solicitation for goods or services (collectively, "Non-Approved Material").

Elite Designs does not provide, sell, license, or lease any of the Materials other than those specifically identified as being provided by Elite Designs.
