If a Checkster user (employer, hiring manager, recruiter, etc.), who is initiating surveys within the Platform, leaves the organization and would like to anonymize their data:
Their account can be locked by the account administrator – this will remove access to Checkster, while still keeping all surveys that the user has started. The account administrator may write-in “error”, “null”, “anonymous”, etc. as the user’s contact information so that the user cannot be identified.
Request from Candidate or Individual
If a candidate or an individual for whom a survey has been or is being conducted would like to anonymize their data, they may reach out to the organization who initiated the survey, or directly to Checkster:
The organization will contact Checkster to anonymize the individual’s data. Checkster will then remove access to the Checkster account, and remove all personal data (Name and Email Address) from the survey. The survey results will still be available to the organization, with “Anonymous” as the individual’s name.
Request from Rater
If an individual who has submitted feedback through Checkster (a rater) would like to remove their data, they may reach out to the organization who initiated the survey, or directly to Checkster. Any requests for rater data erasure coming via the candidate will be verified first with the rater.
The organization or rater will contact Checkster to anonymize this data, and the candidate’s name will be required. Checkster will anonymize the rater’s information so that “Anonymous” appears as the Name, Email Address, and Phone number for all surveys the rater has responded to. The rater’s feedback will still appear on the report, unless exclusion has been requested by the rater or the employer.
