Privacy Policy
Last updated: Wednesday, May 23, 2018
CodeProject is committed to protecting your privacy and to
developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience.
This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of
CodeProject and CodeProject's
website codeproject.com (the "Site")
(for purposes of this privacy policy, CodeProject and the
Site shall collectively, be referred to as "We" or
"CodeProject").
The "Site" refers to https://www.codeproject.com and all other Web
properties owned or operated by CodeProject now and in the
future (or anything that replaces, supplements, or supersedes the Web as the site of
CodeProject).
By providing personal information to CodeProject, you are
consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.
THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS AN AGREEMENT. BY PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE
SITE OR BY ACCESSING THE SITE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO
THE SITE.
PRIVACY PRINCIPLES
As part of our commitment to treat your personal information with respect, we operate in
accordance with the following ten principles (the "Principles"):
Principle 1 - Accountability
Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes
Principle 3 - Consent
Principle 4 - Limiting Collection
Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention
Principle 6 - Accuracy
Principle 7 - Safeguarding Customer Information
Principle 8 - Openness

Principle 1 - Accountability
We will maintain and protect the personal information under our control. We have designated
an individual who is accountable for compliance with the Principles. If you have questions about

information or to opt-out, please contact us by sending e-mail to
Webmaster@codeproject.com or contacting us at:
CodeProject

ph. +1 416-849-8900 x 100
Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes
The purposes for which personal information is collected by us will be identified to you
before or at the time the information is collected.
Principle 3 - Consent
Except where required or permitted by law your informed consent is required for our
collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.
Principle 4 - Limiting Collection
The personal information collected by us shall be limited to those details necessary for the
purposes identified to you. To that end, please note the following description of the type of
information collected and the reason we collect such information.
CodeProject does not require any financial or payment
information. Additionally CodeProject does not intentionally
collect information from any individual under the age of 13 years.
Additionally, none of the material or advertising on CodeProject
is intended to attract 	audiences under the age of 13, and as such
CodeProject does not intentionally collect information
from any individual under the age of 13 years
Personal Information
If you would like to create a new member account, we will collect your name and email
address. In addition, at your option, if you would like to increase your profile on the Site or
with CodeProject generally, or if you would like to be
considered by potential employers for employment (please see Principle 5 for a discussion on
this point), you may also provide whatever personal information you choose including, without
limitation, a brief personal description, lists of interests and experience, where you live, the
time zone in which you are in, your occupation, birthday, links to home pages, a picture of
yourself and a message board signature. In some limited instances, we may require your credit
card information to accommodate your requests to process transactions or access information on
any financial transactions carried out with the Site.
Of course, any time you choose to post an editorial, or other message on the Site, that
information is stored by CodeProject and is viewed, together
with the biographical information you have provided, by all users of the Site.
Please know that only your name and email is necessary to create a new member account,
the provision of all other information is optional depending on what you are looking to do on
the Site and with CodeProject.
Cookies
We use cookies, a piece of text stored on a user’s computer by their web browser,
to store your viewing preferences on the Site and, at your choosing,
to store your login information so that once you have logged in you do not need
to repeat the login process. We also use a session cookie, meaning it expires soon
after you leave the registration process and is not placed on your hard drive, to
store your session information during your visit to the Site. Read our
Cookie Policy for more information.
Anonymous Information
In addition to personal information, certain anonymous information about your visit
is automatically captured when you visit the Site. This information includes the
name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through
which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages
that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from
which you linked directly to our site. None of this information is personally identifiable.
This anonymous information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and
administer the Site.
Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention
We will only use or disclose your personal information in accordance with the purposes
for which it was originally collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when
it is required or permitted by law.
Use of your Personal Information
We use your personal information for the following purposes:
To register you for Site membership.
To customize your experience on the Site.
To send electronic e-mail newsletters, if requested by you.
To fill in certain information for you such as your name and signature when posting
to message boards.
To display your biography at the end of articles and tutorials submitted by you.
Safeguarding Personal Information
CodeProject strictly protects the security of your
personal information, including any financial information, and honors your choices for its
intended use. Data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. While no
security infrastructure is foolproof, we carefully protect your data from loss, misuse,
unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Potential Employment Opportunities
CodeProject is often approached by, or engages with, corporations,
business and other persons who are looking to employ persons with various technology skill
sets. In some instances, CodeProject may try to accommodate such
potential employers by incorporating a job site as part of the Site. In this instance, the
employers would post jobs available for persons with technology skills on the Site and
Site Users would contact the potential employers directly. In this instance,
CodeProject will not provide potential employers with any information
on the Site Users.
Alternatively, employers may choose to contact CodeProject directly and
request that CodeProject provide to them information on those
individuals who are interested in being considered for employment and who have given
their consent to CodeProject providing their information to potential
employers.
With that in mind, if you choose, you can have your information made available by
CodeProject to potential employers. For those persons who choose to make
their personal information available to potential employers, aside from providing
additional resume type information to CodeProject,
CodeProject will be storing the information (as CodeProject
does with all information provided to it) for such a use and, as well,
CodeProject will also sort such information in accordance with
characteristics the potential employers are looking for, and format such information
in a manner easily reviewable by potential employers.
While CodeProject tries to ensure the potential employers are
legitimate, if you choose to have your personal information available to potential
employers,	CodeProject accepts no liability as a result of any action
or inaction of the potential employer, whether such action is a result of the provision
of the personal information to the potential employer, the use such potential employer
makes of the personal information or otherwise.
When Information May be Disclosed to Outside Parties:
Except as specifically provided for in this privacy policy, we do not disclose any
personal information to third parties. CodeProject may disclose personal
information in the following instances:
To conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served to
CodeProject, or the Site;
protect and defend the rights or property of CodeProject and our
family of Web sites, including without limitation investigating potentially	fraudulent
or questionable activities regarding your account(s) or the use of the Site;
To act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of
CodeProject, our Web sites, or the public;
To offer you related products and services that might benefit you (see below);
As part of a single-sign on solution from providers such as GitHub and Google;
In anticipation of and in the course of an actual or potential sale, reorganization,
consolidation, merger or amalgamation of our business; and
Otherwise as permitted or required by law.
The type of information we are legally required to disclose may relate to criminal
investigations. In some instances such as a legal proceeding or court order, we
may also be required to disclose certain information to authorities. Only the information
specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions to satisfy ourselves
that the authorities that are making the request have legitimate grounds to do so.
In addition, CodeProject occasionally hires other companies to provide
limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering prizes,
answering customer questions about products and services, sending postal mail, and
sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will
only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service,
and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
You may be offered the option to provide your information to certain third parties as part
of an advertising promotion, special section, sponsored download, or other area on the
Site. You will be made aware of the use of your information before you provide it, and
the use thereof will be limited to the use to which you agreed.
Finally, for your convenience, we offer single sign-on solutions for account login. These
these third parties (including GitHub and Google, among others) may receive information
from these services when you elect to use them.
Email Addresses
Because email is the dominant form of communication between CodeProject
and you, we wanted to address certain aspects of handling email addresses separately.
Email addresses collected as part of the sign-up process are not made publicly available,
except in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. Most of the time, email
addresses are simply used to confirm your identity and to communicate with you via
email.
Occasionally, third parties want to send emails regarding offers to our members. Unless
you specifically authorize it WE DO NOT PROVIDE SUCH THIRD PARTIES WITH YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS.
These third parties	wishing to send offers to our members do so through us. They send us
the offer and we email it to you on their behalf.
In order to comply with anti-spam legislation such as CANSPAM (in the United States)
there may be cases where a third-party email data house is used to advise us as
to which addresses on our list have specifically opted out of emails from a given
advertiser. In order for this to occur we send our list to the data house, the advertiser
sends their list to the data house, and the data house then advises us of the results.
At no time do we see the third party company's list nor do they see our list.
The data house operates under strict privacy guidelines and obligations of confidentiality.
Principle 6 - Accuracy
We shall make every reasonable effort to ensure your personal information is maintained
in an accurate, complete and up-to-date form.
Principle 7 - Safeguarding Personal Information
CodeProject strictly protects the security of your personal information
and honors your choices	for its intended use. Data is stored in password-controlled servers
with limited access. While no security infrastructure is foolproof, we carefully protect
your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Electronic customer files are kept in a highly secured environment with restricted
access.
We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall infrastructure is
strictly adhered to. Our security practices are reviewed on a regular basis and
we routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the confidentiality and
privacy of your information is not compromised.
Our web site uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) and 256 bit encryption technologies
to enhance security when you visit the secured areas of these sites. TLS is the
industry standard tool for protecting and maintaining the security of message transmissions
over the Internet. When you access your accounts or send information from secured
sites, encryption will scramble your data into an unreadable format to inhibit unauthorized
access by others.
Our Employees and your Personal Information:
In the course of daily operations, access to personal information is restricted
to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing
it. For example, when you call us, our designated employees will access your information
to verify who you are and to assist you in fulfilling your requests.
As a condition of their employment, all employees of CodeProject
are required to abide by the privacy standards we have established. Employees are
informed about the importance of privacy and they understand that they are prohibited
from disclosing any customer information to unauthorized individuals or parties.
Principle 8 - Openness
If you would like a copy of our privacy policies we would be more than happy to
provide one to you and if you have any questions regarding same, we are more than
happy to discuss the merits with you.
Principle 9 - Accessing and Amending Your Information:
You have the right to access, verify and amend the information held in your personal
files. You can review and edit your member profile information at the
CodeProject site by logging on to CodeProject
site with your logon email and password, and then clicking on the 'My Settings'
link.
To help us keep your personal information up-to-date, we encourage you to amend
inaccuracies and make corrections as often as necessary. Despite our efforts, errors
sometimes do occur. Should you identify any incorrect or out-of-date information
in your file(s), we will make the proper changes.
Principle 10 - Handling Customer Complaints and Suggestions
If you have questions about our privacy statement or our use of your information,
or if you need help changing or removing your personal information, please contact us by sending
e-mail to
Webmaster@codeproject.com
