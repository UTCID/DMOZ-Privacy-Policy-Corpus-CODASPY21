Other information you provide in your cover letter and resume.
When you submit the above information on the Site in connection with employment inquiries, BBSI may use this information to consider your candidacy for employment and communicate with you regarding your inquiry. However, merely submitting an employment inquiry through the Site does not guarantee that BBSI will consider you for employment or review any of the information you submit. BBSI is not required to consider your employment inquiry.
3. Do we sell any of your personal information?
BBSI does NOT sell your personal information, including the data of any minors. We do not sell or otherwise trade or disclose for valuable monetary or non-monetary consideration the personal information that we collect from our Site visitors at any point or under any circumstance.
4. Use of cookies and other tracking technologies
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that a website server (such as BBSI’s or its chosen web hosting company server) may transfer to a user’s computer that reside there for either the duration of the browsing session (session cookies) or on a permanent (until deleted) basis (persistent cookies) that may be used to identify a user, a user’s machine, or a user’s behavior. We make use of cookies under the following circumstances and for the following reasons:
Compile data about site traffic to offer a better Site experience
Understand and save visitor preferences for future visits
When accessing a cookie, BBSI’s server reads a number associated with a browser, but is unable to determine any data about a user. With that number, our web server can tailor its content to the needs of the specific browser, and we can optimize the Site for your use.
Google Analytics Advertising FeaturesWe may have the following Google Analytics Advertising Features Implemented: Demographics and Interest reporting, Remarketing, GDN Impression Reporting and Double Click Campaign Manager. These features collect data using Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. BBSI and third-party vendors use these first-party cookies to access the success of online marketing campaigns, inform future campaigns and improve usability on the Site. To learn how to opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features we use, please see Google Analytics’ currently available op-outs for the web: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Facebook Pixel
We are able to identify which Facebook users are engaging with our content through the use of Facebook Pixel. With the data collected, we are able to optimize our Facebook and/or Instagram advertisements to the audience that has shown interest in our product(s) or service(s). Facebook reserves the right to share the information you provide. If you do not want Facebook to share your information, you should remove it from Facebook.
Do Not Track settings
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set if they do not want web services to collect information about their online activity. However, there is currently no universal standard for sending and receiving DNT signals. Due to this lack of universal standard, it would be impossible for us to promise that we comply with all known and unknown DNT standards.
Therefore, we do not respond to DNT signals or other mechanisms that provide a choice regarding the collection of personal information about activities over time and across different Web sites or online services. If a universal standard for DNT becomes available, we may revisit our DNT Policy.
5. Third parties providing services on our behalf
We use third parties to host the Site, design and operate the Site features, and perform administrative, analytics, payment processing, and communications services. Services these third parties provide include enabling BBSI to send you email newsletters and providing information to BBSI about the use of the Site and viewing of our content. We may disclose your Information to these companies so they can carry out these services for BBSI. These companies are bound by contractual obligations to keep the information confidential and to implement and maintain reasonable security measures to safeguard the information.
6. Business Transfers
In the event the Company sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of the Company are acquired, consumer information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.
7. Compliance with law/safety:
The Company may disclose specific personal information based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of our Website, the site itself, or the public.

Call our privacy toll-free line at (1) 888-914-9661 and use the PIN # 151 733.
10. How we will verify that it is really you submitting the above request
If you are a California resident, when you submit a Request to Know, Access or Delete through one of the methods provided above, we will ask you to provide some information in order to verify your identity and respond to your request. Specifically, we will need you to provide your name, email, phone number, IP address, and device ID.  [AND / OR] If your sole interaction with us was as a website visitor, then in order to verify your identify, we will need to ask you to provide your name, email, phone number, IP address, device ID, browser ID, and/or cookie ID.
11. Responding to Right to Know, Access, and Delete Requests
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days or 90 days total from the date we receive your request), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
12. Responding to your consumer request to opt-out of the sale of your personal information
We will act upon a verifiable consumer request to opt-out within fifteen (15) days of its receipt. We will notify all third parties to whom we have sold personal information within 90 days of our receipt of your request that you have exercised your right to opt-out and instruct them not to further sell the information. We will notify you when this has been completed by mail or electronically, at your option.
A request to opt-out need not be a verifiable consumer request. However, we may deny a request to opt-out if we have a good faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request to opt-out is fraudulent. If we deny your request to opt-out, we shall inform you of our decision not to comply and provide an explanation as to why we believe the request is fraudulent.
13. How to authorize an agent to act on your behalf
If you are a California resident, you can authorize someone else as an Authorized Agent who can submit a request on your behalf. To authorize an agent, you must either (a) execute a valid, verifiable, and notarized Power of Attorney or (b) provide other written authorization that we can then verify. When we receive a consumer request submitted on your behalf by an Authorized Agent, that person will be asked to provide written proof that they have your permission to act on your behalf, and we will also contact you and ask you for information to verify your own identity directly with us and not through your Authorized Agent.
14. Children under the age of 16
Our Site is not intended for children under 16 years of age and we do not knowingly collect information about children under age 16. No one under age 16 may provide any personal information on the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.

15. How we protect the information that we collect
