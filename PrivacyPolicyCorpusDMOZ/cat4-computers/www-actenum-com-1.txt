Our Terms of Use for this website
Introduction
These terms of use govern the use of the Actenum website (the “website”), accessible as actenum.com, or www.actenum.com. The website is owned and operated by Actenum Corporation (“Actenum”). The website may not be used or accessed other than in accordance with these terms of use, so you should read them carefully. If you do not agree with any of these terms of use, then you may not use the website. Your use of the website constitutes your acceptance of these terms of use in their entirety.
These terms of use may be modified by Actenum from time to time, in its sole discretion, by posting an updated version on the website.
Use of content
All materials displayed or otherwise accessible through the website, including, without limitation, text, photographs, images, illustrations, video clips, audio clips, trade-marks, trade names and logos, and the website itself as a compilation (collectively, the “Content”), is protected under Canadian and foreign copyright or other laws, and is owned by Actenum, its licensors, or others who may or may not be accredited as the provider of the Content. You are granted by Actenum a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and display the Content on your computer or other electronic access device for your own personal and non-commercial use only, provided that: (i) you do not modify the Content; (ii) you maintain all copyright and other proprietary notices; and (iii) you abide by all additional copyright notices, information and restrictions on or contained in any of the Content.
Any other use of the website or the Content is not permitted without Actenum’s prior written consent. You agree not to reproduce, make derivative works of, retransmit, distribute, sell, publish, communicate, broadcast, or otherwise make available, or authorize others to do so, the website or any of the Content, including without limitation, by caching, framing or similar means without Actenum’s prior written consent. Linking to the website is permitted, provided that: (i) you advise us in writing of any such link; and (ii) Actenum reserves the right to prohibit linking to or from any other website in Actenum’s sole discretion. Linking to the website which does not link to the functionality of the website in its entirety or which results in any form of framing or other use of the website or of any of the Content in association with any material not previously approved by Actenum is expressly prohibited.
Trade-marks
Actenum, the Actenum logo, designs, and catch phrases on the website are official marks or trade-marks of Actenum.

While certain trade-marks of third parties may be used by Actenum, the display of third-party trade-marks on the website should not be taken to imply any relationship or licence between Actenum and the owner of such trade-mark, or to imply that Actenum endorses the wares, services, or business of the owner of such trade-mark. Nothing contained on the website should be construed as granting you any licence or right to use any trade-mark, logo, design, or catch phrase of Actenum or any third party, without the written permission of Actenum or the respective owner of any third-party trade-mark.
