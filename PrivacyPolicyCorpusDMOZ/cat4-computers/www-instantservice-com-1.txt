Oracle Buys ATG
On November 2, 2010, Oracle announced that it has agreed to acquire Art Technology Group (ATG), a leading provider of eCommerce software and related on demand commerce optimization applications.
ATG's solutions enable enterprises to provide a cohesive online customer experience with sophisticated merchandising, marketing, content personalization, automated recommendations, and live-help services.

Driven by the convergence of online and traditional commerce and the need to increase revenue and improve customer loyalty—organizations across many industries are seeking a unified cross-channel commerce and customer relationship management platform to deliver a cohesive customer experience across all commerce channels.
Together Oracle and ATG expect to help businesses grow revenue, strengthen customer loyalty, improve brand value, achieve better operating results, and increase business agility across online and traditional commerce environments.
