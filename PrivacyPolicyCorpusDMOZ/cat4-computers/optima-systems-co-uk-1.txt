12. Cookies Policy - Information Optima Systems Ltd collects from you
Summary
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information. This information is used to track visitor use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.
For further information visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.
You can set your browser not to accept cookies and the above websites tell you how to remove cookies from your browser. However, in a few cases some of our website features may not function as a result.
In Detail
a. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by another website. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website to track online traffic flows.
During any visit to Optima Systems Ltd website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. This enables us to find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
b. How does Optima Systems Ltd website use cookies?
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. Optima Systems Ltd uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see section 6 above).
c. Third Party Cookies in embedded content on Optima Systems Ltd pages
Please note that during your visits to Optima Systems Ltd website you may notice some cookies that are not related to Optima Systems Ltd or Optima Systems Ltd.’s contractors. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube you may be presented with cookies from these websites. Optima Systems Ltd does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third-party website for more information about these.
Types of cookies
First party cookies
First party (or standard) cookies are set by the website, you are visiting, and they can only be read by that site.
Third party cookies
Third party cookies are set by a different organisation to the owner of the website you are visiting. For example, the website might use a third-party analytics company who will set their own cookie to perform this service. The website you are visiting may also contain content embedded from, for example YouTube and these sites may set their own cookies.
Session cookies
Session Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from the user’s device when the browser is closed.
Persistent cookies
This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to know who you are for more than one browsing session.
Flash cookies
Optima Systems Ltd does not use this type of cookie. However, many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to their users. Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings but are used by the Flash Player for similar purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking users.
Flash Cookies work in a different way to web browser cookies (the cookie types listed above are all set via your browser); rather than having individual cookies for particular jobs, a website is restricted to storing all data in one cookie. You can control how much data can be stored in that cookie, but you cannot choose what type of information can be stored.
13. Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to a website to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests.
14. Changes to Optima Systems Ltd's Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to Optima Systems Ltd. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the Optima Systems Ltd website to submit personal information to Optima Systems Ltd. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the website.
