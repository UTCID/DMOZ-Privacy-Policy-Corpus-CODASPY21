Whois Privacy
(WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in)
Zones Web Solution - Whois Privacy
(WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in)
Whois Privacy/ Whois Protection/ Domain Privacy/ Domain
Protection is very important to owners of domain names, they don't like
their home address to be shared just because they own a domain name. ICANN the
organization in charge of overseeing domain names has a rule that forces the
domain registrar to release this information to anyone that asks for it.
Certainly that is not a good rule; just because a person asks for your home
address doesn't mean your domain registrar should release it.
The main reason domain owners want to hide their contact information is because
their email address listed on the whois record can be used to spam. The only way
to prevent spam is to hide the email address on the whois record or to shield
the address with a spam-proof proxy email service.
You now have the ability to change that... with Zones Web Solutions - Whois
Privacy (WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in)
By selecting Whois Privacy your domain registration becomes a "private" unlisted
registration though Zones Web Solutions - WhoisPrivacy.zones.in.
Whois Privacy works by:
· Shielding your Private Information.
· Protects you from: Whois based SPAM, Identity Theft, Stalkers..
· Helps to Maintain your Privacy!
· WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in's Information is made public, not your..
· Offering you complete control of the domain name.
Whois Privacy does NOT work:
· With all TLD's offered. Please check for Availability with your domain.
· With Spammers, Criminals or questionable activity.
(WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in has a zero tolerance policy with regards to these type of
activates.)
You can Add Whois Privacy to your
Domain Registration for FREE *
Now you have a choice. By adding WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in's Whois Privacy to
your Domain, your private contact information is not exposed.
WhoisPrivacy.Zones.in's contact information is displayed to provide you with the
highest level of protection against spammers and identity theft.
See the difference!
NOTE: ICANN requires all domain holders to have valid Registrant
Information on File. ICANN mandates that invalid or inaccurate contact
information can be grounds for domain name cancellation. Whois Privacy does NOT
work with .US, .DE, .EU, .NAME, .TW and .SG domain Ext.
