Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
SAPIEN Technologies, Inc.
SAPIEN respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes exactly how SAPIEN uses
SAPIEN identifiable information regarding our customers (such as name, address, and
email addresses—hereafter referred to as "Customer Information"). Except as specifically described in this
Privacy Policy, SAPIEN does not sell, rent or share such Customer Information with third parties.
By registering on our site or using our services, you consent to the collection and
use of information in the manner described below. If we decide to change our privacy
practice, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what
information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
Changes to our policy will be prospective only. Please check this page from time to
time for changes to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.
In this Privacy Policy, you will find the answers to the following questions:
What personally identifiable information does SAPIEN collect?
How is the information used?
With whom does SAPIEN share the information?
Does SAPIEN use "IP Addresses" and cookies?
What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your
information from loss,misuse, or alteration?
How can you update or correct personally identifiable information?
What Customer Information does SAPIEN collect?
Customer Information is requested when you register with SAPIEN, when you use
certain SAPIEN products or services, when you visit SAPIEN pages, and when you
enter promotions or sweepstakes. SAPIEN may also collect similarly identifiable
information from our business partners. When you register with SAPIEN, we ask
for your name, e-mail address, zip code and other information. When you purchase
SAPIEN products, you may be required to give your credit card number and other
necessary billing information.
SAPIEN offers optional promotional opportunities for which you may decide to
submit Customer Information. For example, SAPIEN may occasionally run contests
or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for
contact information (like an email address) or demographic information (like
a zip code). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions
to send you promotional material about our company or our partners or sponsors -
with your permission. Your customer contact information collected from these
contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary and may be
shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior
permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in
the promotion. You are never required to take part in a contest or promotion --
you may always simply decline if you do not wish to provide requested information.
How is Customer Information used by SAPIEN?
We collect Customer Information for two general purposes: to fulfill your request
for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products.
We may also contact you to offer sweepstakes or other promotional opportunities.
Billing information is collected solely for the purpose of fulfilling your order request.
With whom does SAPIEN share Customer Information?
Currently, SAPIEN shares your Customer Information only with third party
intermediaries (for example, our credit card authorization company, technical
support providers, or shipping fulfillment services) who help us fulfill your
service requests. Your Customer Information is provided to these third parties
solely for the purpose of giving you the services you request at the time that
you request them. Third party intermediaries do not store, retain, access or
otherwise use your Customer Information other than as necessary to provide you
with the SAPIEN service. From time to time SAPIEN may utilize services of other
third party firms to perform activities that SAPIEN might otherwise perform itself.
For example, we might use a third-party firm to compare our customer data to
"don't call" lists to assure that we respect customer contact wishes. We might
use a similar firm to attempt to "clean" our customer data, in other words update
contact information, zipcodes, area codes, etc. In such cases we require our vendors
to respect our privacy policy.
Except as described above, SAPIEN will not sell, rent or otherwise share Customer
Information with a third party without your knowledge and consent prior to any
data collection or transfer. If you do not want your Customer Information shared
at that time you will always have the option of telling us not to share it. For
those purposes, "SAPIEN" means SAPIEN Technologies, Inc. and any successors to
the assets or business of SAPIEN Technologies, Inc. The one exception to the rule
described in this section is the following: if SAPIEN is required by law (or to
protect its rights or property), we will disclose Customer Information to the
extent so required.
Does SAPIEN use "IP Addresses" and cookies? Once you register with SAPIEN and
sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. SAPIEN automatically receives
and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP
address, SAPIEN cookie information and the page you requested.
SAPIEN uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows:
IP Addresses: An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique
identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP
addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to
help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP
address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic
distribution of our members.
SAPIEN Cookies: Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or
personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record
only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies
are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit
our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next
time you come back. Currently, SAPIEN intends to make only limited use of cookies
for the purpose of delivering content and ads specific to your interests. For
instance cookies may be used to retain your registration information or save your
password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in. We also use
cookies to "remember" where you have been on our site, and what promotions you
have seen. This permits us to eliminate duplicate promotions, or to send summarized
versions of information you may already have seen in detail. Because the cookies
reside on your computer, we can avoid storing certain information about you on ours.
Advice on Limiting Cookies: You always have a choice with respect to cookies.
By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when
a cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you
may be unable to use certain SAPIEN services. Please consult your browser instructions
for information on how to modify your choices about cookies.
What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your
information from loss, misuse, or alteration?
Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. In addition,
SAPIEN employs TLS to encrypt and protect your Customer Information during sales
transactions. Further, we limit access of Customer Information to only those
employees and vendors who need it to carry out their jobs or provide their services.
If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.)
or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly
recommend that you sign out of your SAPIEN account and close your browser
before getting up and moving away from the computer. This will prevent others
from accessing your account and personal information.
SAPIEN will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or
in an unsolicited email. You will only be asked for your registration information
and password when you initiate the contact and only if the information is
necessary to correct a service problem.
How can you update or correct Customer Information?
Customer Information that you provide during registration may be edited
at any time by calling SAPIEN customer service directly at 866-774-6257 .
If you wish to cancel your SAPIEN account, advise customer service and we
will remove and discard any Customer Information associated with your account.
Other information about privacy
Notification of Change: If SAPIEN intends to expand the ways that Customer
Information is used under this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our
site in advance.
Contacting SAPIEN: If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy,
the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can
contact us at info@sapien.com
