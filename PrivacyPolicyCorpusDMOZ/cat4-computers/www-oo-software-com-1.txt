O&O Software
The history and data saved in your browser can reveal a lot about you and your internet activities. Cookies, for example, make it easy for websites to identify and follow you. With just the push of a button, O&O BrowserPrivacy destroys all the data collected in the browsers you use. It lets you set the level of security at which your data should be destroyed. This gives you complete control over which data in the respective browser O&O BrowserPrivacy should permanently delete for you. This applies, of course, only to those browsers supported by O&O BrowserPrivacy.
Thanks to O&O Software’s brand-new O&O SolidErase, data on SSDs can now be totally and securely shredded while going easy on the hardware itself.
Protect your privacy
O&O BrowserPrivacy destroys browser traces securely, dependably, and permanently
Save time and avoid worry
O&O BrowserPrivacy recognizes your installed browsers. You just have to decide which data from which browser should be destroyed and O&O BrowserPrivacy does all the rest.
You have complete control
You set the security level you want for data deletion. Select the data you want permanently removed with just one click: browser history, downloaded files, cookies and website data, cache, bookmarks, passwords, and form data.
O&O BrowserPrivacy was developed by us to help you protect your privacy as easily as possible while giving you complete control over the data you want to have destroyed.
The complete data destruction solution
You not only want to delete browser data but also individual files, folders, or all the content on PCs? Then O&O SafeErase is just right for you.
Use in companies
O&O BrowserPrivacy is licensed per computer. If you want to delete data on an unlimited number of computers, our O&O SafeErase Admin Edition is the right choice. The license is issued to an administrator who is then entitled to use the product on any number of company computers.
Data deletion as IT service
You want to offer your customers data deletion as a service? The O&O SafeErase Tech Edition is the way to go. It is licensed to an IT service providing technician who can then use the product for permanently deleting data on an unlimited number of computers.
System requirements: Windows® 8 till Windows® 10 (all editions)
