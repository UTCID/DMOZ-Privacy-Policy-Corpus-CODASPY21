What Is A Cookie?
Cookies are small files sent by web servers to web browsers, and stored by the web browsers. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables a web server to identify and track web browsers.

In addition to our own cookies, we work with various reputable companies (like Google, Facebook) to help us analyse how QualityUnit is used, and to optimise our Website and Apps to deliver the best possible experience.
Refusing Cookies
Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
