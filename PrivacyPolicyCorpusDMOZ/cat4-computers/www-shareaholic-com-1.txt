Advertising Choices
We are an advertising supported service, which means that we are able to offer many of our services without charge to you by displaying or supporting advertising on our service and on partner websites.
When we do, we try to serve you advertising and offers that we think are most likely to be relevant to you.
We believe that delivering relevant advertising enhances your Internet experience. We collect non-personally identifiable information from many of the websites on which our products are enabled, and may use that information to deliver targeted advertising on those websites as well as other websites you may visit.

We implement your choice to opt-out by placing a cookie on your browser indicating your choice. It applies to the computer and browser that you used when you established the opt-out choice. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or clear your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie may also be cleared and you should re-establish your opt-out choice.
If you opt out of receiving customized advertising from us, we may still place cookies on your browser for the purpose of delivering the rest of our services, such as to automatically log you into our services if you have requested that service or to deliver advertising that is not customized.
We are committed to DNT
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect to improve your experience with us and your web experience.
We also support Do Not Track (DNT) as one of the ways you can indicate your preference.
