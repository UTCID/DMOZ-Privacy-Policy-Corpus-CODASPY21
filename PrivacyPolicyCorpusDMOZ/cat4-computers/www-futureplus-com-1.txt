Our Policy
FuturePlus Systems Corporation respects the privacy of every individual who visits our site or responds to our interactive advertisements. We don’t collect personally- identifiable information from you, unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We don’t require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site.

We don’t share the information with anyone outside of FuturePlus Systems Corporation. We don’t use your email address for any purpose other than sending you information you requested. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or address listed in this Privacy Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our databases. Our site sometimes includes notices of promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you’re a winner).
