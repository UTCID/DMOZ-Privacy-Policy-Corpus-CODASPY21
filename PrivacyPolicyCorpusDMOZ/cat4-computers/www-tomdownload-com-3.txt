Some FAQs about Records Registry:
Is this a scam?? Do these resources really exist? - We can understand you being skeptical about the program. After all, there are a lot of untrustworthy sites on the internet, but not RecordsRegistry.com! We assure you that this is for real! We have years of experience and we know you will be pleased.
Who are RecordsRegistry? How can I trust you? -
RecordsRegistry is headquartered in Glover VT and is an industry leader in Informational Research. We have been involved in this industry for over 3 years, so you know you can trust us for quality resources!
Will anyone know I am researching information on them? - Nobody will ever be aware that you are conducting an investigation on them. RecordsRegistry is totally private and you will be completely anonymous when using our service for your research.
Is finding information about someone as easy as inserting a name? - Yes and no. Remember, RecordsRegistry are providing you with the resources and databases to several different sources. You will have to go to each source to find out each different piece of information you are looking for. You cannot enter a name once and get everything you need. It will take a bit of work and time but you will find it relatively easy once we show you where to look!
Is it legal to conduct research and to use RecordsRegistry? - The Federal Freedom of Information Act allows for public viewing of many different types of records including criminal, property, background, and the like. None of the Records Registry resources are illegal, or will allow you to perform an illegal search. Also, no one will ever know you are investigating them. You will be completely anonymous!
