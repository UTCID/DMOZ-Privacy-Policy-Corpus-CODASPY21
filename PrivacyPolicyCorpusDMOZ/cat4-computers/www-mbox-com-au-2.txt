To demonstrate our commitment to Customer privacy, we have developed a Privacy Policy which forms an integral part of this Agreement, a current copy of which is available at http://mbox.com.au/legal/#privacy. If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes in the Privacy Policy displayed on our Website, and other places we deem appropriate, so our Customers are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use our Customers' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify Customers via email. Customers will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if Customers have opted out of all communication with j2 Global, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect Customer information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying Customers of the change. In some cases where we post a notice of changes to our Privacy Policy, we will also notify via email those Customers who have opted to receive email communications from us.

9. Customer Responsibilities.
You are fully responsible for the contents of your transmissions through the Services. j2 Global simply acts as a passive conduit for you to send and receive information of your own choosing. However, j2 Global reserves the right to take any action with respect to the Services that j2 Global deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, if j2 Global believes you or your information may create liability for j2 Global, compromise or disrupt the Services for you or other Customers, or cause j2 Global to lose (in whole or in part) the services of j2 Global's ISPs or other suppliers. Your use of the Services is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations (including without limitation those governing account collection, export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, securities or false advertising). You agree: (1) to comply with all laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from any country through the Services; (2) not to use the Services for any illegal purpose; (3) not to interfere with or disrupt networks connected to the Services; (4) to comply with all regulations, policies and procedures of networks connected to the Services; (5) not to use the Services to infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; and (6) not to transmit through the Services any unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature. You further agree not to transmit any material that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation. The Services make use of the Internet for you to send and receive information of your own choosing. As a result, your conduct is subject to Internet regulations, policies and procedures. You agree not use or reference the Services for chain letters, junk fax or junk mail, spamming or any activity making use of distribution lists to any person who has not given specific permission to be included in such a process or on such list. You further agree not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems. You shall not interfere with another Customer's use and enjoyment of the Services or another entity's use and enjoyment of similar services.
You must (a) obtain and pay for all equipment and third-party services (e.g., Internet access and email service) required for you to access and use eFax Services; (b) maintain the security of your PIN number, password and other confidential information relating to your eFax account and; (c) to the full extent permitted by applicable law, be responsible for all charges resulting from use of your eFax account, including unauthorized use prior to your notifying j2 Global of such use and taking steps to prevent its further occurrence.

10. Unsolicited Fax Advertisement/Spam Drop-Box Policy.
Unsolicited Fax Advertisement Policy. The transmission of unsolicited fax advertisements is illegal in the United States under the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) (http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/unwantedfaxes.html) and in the European Union under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, and is also illegal under the laws of a number of other countries, states and provinces. Distribution of unsolicited fax advertisements through the Services is prohibited. Notwithstanding the above, j2 Global's distribution of advertising to its customers is not considered unsolicited fax advertising based upon your acceptance of this Agreement.
At j2 Global's option and without further notice, j2 Global may use technologies and procedures, such as filters, that may terminate the transmission of such unsolicited fax advertisements without delivering them.
If you believe that you are in receipt of an unsolicited fax advertisement, we ask that you take the following two steps:
If the fax contains a telephone number, fax number, or other contact information to "unsubscribe" from receipt of additional junk faxes, please do so; and
Please go to the following Web page and complete the complaint form by inserting the required information and attaching a copy of the offending fax: http://mbox.com.au/legal/#report-spam. You hereby acknowledge and agree that j2 Global, as owner of all eFax Numbers, has any and all rights (but no obligation) to assert any and all legal claims available against any third party as a result of your receipt of any unsolicited fax advertisements, including but not limited to claims under the TCPA and similar laws of any other country, state or province, and, to the extent you do have any rights to bring any such claims, you hereby assign any and all such rights to j2 Global as consideration for its provision of the services under this Agreement.
Because our eFax Numbers may be reassigned to other customers in the event your account is canceled, and to ensure the best possible service for all customers, you are not permitted to "opt in" to receive on your eFax Number facsimile advertisements of the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services from persons with whom you have not established a business relationship.
Spam Drop-Box Policy. j2 Global does not permit its Customers to use their eFax Number as a “drop-box” for responses to email or fax spam offers. If you believe you are in receipt of email or fax spam that uses an eFax Number as a "drop-box" for responses, we ask that you take the following steps:
If the email or fax contains an email address, telephone number, fax number, or other contact information to "unsubscribe" from receipt of additional messages, please do so.
If you are unable to successfully "unsubscribe," please forward the offending email to abuse@mail.j2.com. We will investigate your complaint and determine if the fax/voicemail number referenced in the spam email or spam fax is an eFax Number. If it is, we will attempt to contact the customer and, if necessary and appropriate, terminate or suspend their eFax Service.
We appreciate your assistance in enforcing and complying with these policies and look forward to continuing to make the eFax experience a positive one for you.

In order for you to give notice to j2 Global, you must go to the eFax Website at www.efax.com/cancel and click on the “Chat Now” button or contact one of our customer service representatives. A customer service representative will assist you with cancelling your account in accordance with j2 Global’s verification procedures, as such procedures may be changed by j2 Global in its sole discretion. j2 Global reserves the right to terminate or suspend your eFax account without prior notice, provided that j2 Global will attempt to confirm such termination or suspension by subsequent notice.

Payment of your eFax account balance is due monthly or annually, in accordance with your payment plan, in the currency in which billed, and must be made by the credit or debit card designated by you for j2 Global use and transactions or through such other payment methods as j2 Global may provide from time to time. If your eFax account is a qualified business account and is approved by j2 Global for corporate billing, charges will be accumulated, identified by Customer identification number and invoiced on a monthly basis. If payment for your eFax account is not received by j2 Global by its due date, you agree to immediately pay all amounts due upon demand by j2 Global. Each time you use eFax Services, or allow or cause eFax Services to be used, you agree and reaffirm that j2 Global is authorized to charge your designated card or obtain payment for the Services through such other means as are legally available to j2 Global. Your card issuer's agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with eFax, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You agree that j2 Global may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each cycle, and that j2 Global may delay obtaining authorization from your bank or card issuer until submission of the accumulated charge(s). This means that accumulated charges may appear on the statement you receive from your bank or card issuer.
To view your current account balance, along with billing details and any accumulated charges, please click on "Billing" after logging in to the eFax Website.
Your activation fee and monthly or annual service fees, as applicable, are payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE. You agree that for monthly subscriptions, j2 Global may submit charges for your monthly service fee each month, and for annual subscriptions, j2 Global may submit charges for your annual service fee annually, and additional usage charges monthly, in each case, without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before j2 Global reasonably could act on your notice. If you sign up for more than one eFax number, your first payment for such additional eFax numbers may be prorated to coincide with the annual anniversary of your first eFax number. If you have any question regarding any charges that have been applied to your account, you must contact j2 Global's Customer Service Department within thirty (30) days of the charge date. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for refusing to pay any charges submitted by j2 Global in accordance with this Agreement.
If you subscribed for eFax Services pursuant to a special offer granting you a free trial period, your activation fee and initial service fee will be PRE-AUTHORIZED AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD LIMIT (meaning the amounts pre-authorized will not be considered available credit or debit funds in such account) and will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card, without further authorization from you, upon the expiration of such free trial period, unless you provide prior notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before j2 Global reasonably could act on your notice.
If you subscribed for eFax Services pursuant to a special offer granting a pre-paid discount for a fixed number of months, your pre-paid fees are payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE. In addition, your initial monthly service fee for the month immediately following your pre-paid period will be PRE-AUTHORIZED AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD LIMIT and will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card, without further authorization from you, upon the expiration of such pre-paid period, unless you provide prior notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before j2 Global reasonably could act on your notice.
For non-toll-free eFax Pro or eFax Plus Customers, you will incur charges in addition to the minimum monthly charge if you receive a combined number of fax pages and voicemail messages through your eFax account in excess of that permitted by our Fair Use Policy described in paragraph 2. a. and 3. a. respectively, above. Per page usage includes pages received or sent through the Services. For each transmission (sending or receiving), the number of pages is calculated based on the greater of the actual number of pages or the number of full or partial 60-second increments of transmission time. You agree that j2 Global may submit charges for such usage charges as and when such charges are incurred or by accumulating such charges (in the sole discretion of j2 Global), without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before j2 Global reasonably could act on your notice. If you are using eFax Services from certain locations, you may also incur charges levied by your Internet service provider, online service provider and/or long distance carrier to access j2 Global.
For all eFax Pro and eFax Plus customers, additional charges for outbound fax service and/or other usage-based services as j2 Global may introduce from time to time are payable in advance by deposit of a fixed amount as set from time to time by j2 Global (currently U.S. $10.00, or the approximate equivalent in local currency). Customers with higher service needs may increase the size of their deposit by logging into their account at the eFax Website or by contacting Customer Service. This deposit will be due and payable immediately upon your use of any usage-based service (or, in the event you are provided with a free credit, upon your depletion of such free credit). As a result, the first time you use any of these usage-based Services (following your depletion of your free credit, if any), a deposit (currently U.S. $10.00 or the approximate equivalent in local currency) will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card without further authorization from you. Your deposit will thereafter be depleted based upon your use of outbound fax service and/or other usage-based charges, according to standard j2 Global messaging rates for these eFax Services. Thereafter, each time your deposit is depleted to $2.00 or the approximate equivalent in local currency, another fixed amount deposit in the same amount as the prior deposit will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card, without further authorization from you, which deposit will thereafter be depleted based upon your use of outbound fax service and/or other usage-based services, according to standard j2 Global messaging rates for these eFax Services. With respect to the eFax outbound faxing service, please be advised that j2 Global will bill you for each attempt made by j2 Global to send the fax where any transmission occurs whether or not the transmission is completed, such as instances when someone answers the call or transmission is interrupted before completion.
In the event j2 Global submits charges for your monthly service fee and those charges are rejected by your bank or card issuer (or its agent or affiliate), you hereby authorize j2 Global to use your deposit to pay for any monthly service fee due to j2 Global until j2 Global is able to successfully charge your card or otherwise obtain payment for the Services. In the event j2 Global is subsequently able to successfully process your monthly service fee through your credit or debit card or through other methods legally available to j2 Global, j2 Global will automatically replenish your deposit for all monthly service fees paid from your deposit and will charge your credit or debit card in an amount equal to this amount or otherwise obtain payment of this amount (and you hereby authorize j2 Global to do so).
You agree that j2 Global may submit charges for these deposits without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before j2 Global reasonably could act on your notice. Upon notice (in accordance with j2 Global's verification procedures, as may be established by j2 Global from time to time in its sole discretion) from you that you have terminated this authorization, you will be entitled to a refund of any unused portion of your most recent deposit, unless at such time there are any outstanding charges resulting from use of your eFax account (including those charges described in the preceding paragraphs), in which case the remainder of your deposit will be applied to satisfy such charges. i. You must promptly notify j2 Global of changes to: (a) the account number or expiration date of your designated credit or debit card or other payment method; (b) your billing address for the designated credit or debit card or other payment method; and (c) the name of each minor whom you have authorized to use your eFax account. You must also promptly notify j2 Global if your card or other payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft).

YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE j2 GLOBAL TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD IN THE APPLICABLE AMOUNT OR TO OTHERWISE ARRANGE TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT TO j2 GLOBAL WITHIN THE PORTING NOTICE PERIOD. IF YOU FAIL TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS, THE TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU “PORTED IN” WILL BECOME THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF j2 GLOBAL.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF YOUR eFAX ACCOUNT FOR ANY REASON, SUCH eFAX NUMBER MAY BE RE-ASSIGNED IMMEDIATELY TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER, AND YOU AGREE THAT j2 GLOBAL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF ANY SUCH RE-ASSIGNMENT, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH RE-ASSIGNMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACTUAL, TORT OR OTHER GROUNDS, EVEN IF j2 GLOBAL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.
YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT j2 GLOBAL MAY FROM TIME TO TIME NEED TO CHANGE THE eFAX NUMBER ASSIGNED TO YOU (WHETHER DUE TO AN AREA CODE SPLIT OR ANY OTHER REASON WHETHER OUTSIDE OR WITHIN j2 GLOBAL'S CONTROL).

Information Collection and Use
Information Collection
j2 Global is the sole owner of the information collected on its Websites. j2 Global collects information from its users at several different points on its Websites both directly from the user and through the use of cookies, log files and clear gifs.
Registration
In order to use j2 Global services at any level, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address), and a unique identifier to j2 Global. We use this information to contact the user about services on our Websites for which the user has expressed interest. It is optional for a paying customer to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Websites. Users who subscribe to a j2 Global free service may be required to give general demographic information, such as gender and occupation.
Order
When a user purchases a paying service, we request contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date) from the user. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Web sites. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
By setting a cookie on one of our Websites, users do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our Website. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Website. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. See the "Profile" section below.

However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.

Clear Gifs

Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.

Sharing
We do not share information obtained from users on our Websites except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy.

All civil subpoenas should be directed to:
j2 Global Communications, Inc.
Subpoena Department
6922 Hollywood Boulevard
5th Floor
Los Angeles, CA 90028
Fax: 1-310-943-2400
or:
j2 Global Ireland Limited.

Santry, Dublin 9
Ireland
Fax: +353 1 633 5741
Upon receipt of a valid subpoena, it is j2 Global's policy to notify the subscriber whose information is sought. In non-emergency circumstances, j2 Global will generally not produce the subpoenaed subscriber's identity information until approximately two weeks after receipt of the subpoena, unless a formal objection is filed by the customer or we are legally required to do so.
j2 Global charges $90.00 per hour for research (plus additional fees if testimony or deposition is required), $0.25 per page, and $22.00 to respond via express courier (or equivalent amounts in local currency). We will invoice the person or entity submitting the subpoena following receipt and the subpoena proponent must make payment within 15 days from the date of receipt of our invoice. Checks should be made out to j2 Global Communications, Inc. or j2 Global Ireland Ltd. respectively.
It is j2 Global's policy to release information sufficient to identify our customer only where the party seeking the information has filed a legal action that implicates our customer in some legally cognizable impropriety or wrongdoing or can show that the information requested is material to the issues involved in the underlying case. j2 Global requests a copy of the complaint and all supporting documentation to indicate how the customer's account information is related to the pending litigation. Note that j2 Global reserves the right to determine in its sole discretion the applicability of this policy to any particular request and, further, this policy does not create any enforceable legal rights, either for our customers or for requesting parties.
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
Third Party Intermediaries
We use an outside payment processing company to bill users for goods and services. In addition, we may use third parties to host certain portions of our Websites and to fulfill certain requests for information from our users. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Business Transitions
In the event j2 Global goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition or a sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to users before their personal information is transferred or becomes subject to another privacy policy.
Choice/Opt-out
Users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' from having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Websites at the point where we ask for information. Our registration forms have an 'opt-in' mechanism from YesMail, where users can choose to receive promotions according to their particular interests. Users must proactively choose to receive these promotions.
j2 Global also sends its user base information on special promotions and partner services that we think might be relevant to the user. Users of a j2 Global free service are automatically opted-in and are considered to consent to receive this information. These materials are monitored by j2 Global for content and regularity to respect the wishes of our free users. j2 Global free users may opt-out of receiving these promotional materials by either upgrading to a paid service or by canceling their accounts.
Paying j2 Global users who do not wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out from receiving these communications by clicking the opt-out link included at the bottom of every promotional message.
Users of our sites are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.
Links
j2 Global's Websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that j2 Global is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by j2 Global through its Websites. j2 Global has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy. j2 Global has Co-Brand relationships with some websites. A site is a Co-Brand of j2 Global if it offers j2 Global technology or services to its users under a different brand. The Co-Branded sites will have their own privacy policies specific to each site, and the user should read them carefully before registration.
Surveys
Periodically, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of j2 Global's services. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and a choice to opt-out. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use customers' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our services, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. j2 Global will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit j2 Global's Websites. j2 Global stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
Security
j2 Global takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via j2 Global's Websites, their information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.
Supplementation of Information
In order for j2 Global to properly fulfill its obligations to users, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources. j2 Global verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and may obtain credit reports for some corporate customers. The information obtained from these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with j2 Global's Privacy Policy.
Accessing/Correcting/Updating/Deleting Personal Information
j2 Global makes good faith efforts to provide users with access to their personal information and to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete such information at users’ request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law. Users are required to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before we process such requests. This can usually be done at the profile page of the j2 Global service patronized by the user or by contacting our customer service agents.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with j2 Global, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
Safe Harbor
We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website. In the event that any dispute arising out of or related to this policy is not settled by the parties, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute by non-binding mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. No litigation for the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such rules and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The parties to the mediation shall share the costs of mediation equally. Any settlement reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and shall be binding on them.
Data Retention
The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
