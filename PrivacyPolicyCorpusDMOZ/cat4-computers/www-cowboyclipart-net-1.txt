Privacy Policy
CowboyClip Art is committed to protecting
the privacy of all visitors to our
web site. Below is information
outlining our continued support for
the responsible management of
visitor information.
Consumer Information
During the process of
delivering web pages to
you, Cowboy Clip Art does not collect
any
personally identifiable
information about you such as
name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.
However, Cowboy Clip Art
does obtain some types of
non-personally
identifiable
information such as the Internet
Service
Provider you use to
connect to the Internet, your
browser
type, or the type of
computer operating system you use
(Macintosh or Windows, for example). The
information collected is used for the purpose
of
targeting ads and measuring ad
effectiveness on behalf of
our
advertisers.
Data Collection and Opt Out
Cowboy Clip Art, as well as
most
sites on the Internet, use
"cookies" to enhance
your experience on the web. Cowboy Clip Art cannot
use
these cookies to personally
identify you in any way. What
are
cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a
unique
number that is provided to
you the first time we serve
you a
banner ad. This unique number, which is stored in
a
cookie file on your computer,
helps us target ads to you.
This
cookie can help us ensure that we don't serve
you
the same ad multiple times,
and help our advertisers
understand what you like and don't like about
their
offerings so that they can
cater better to your needs the
next time you are interested in their products
or
services. While we believe that
cookies enhance your
Internet
experience by limiting the number of times
you
see the same ad and delivering
more relevant content to you,
they are not required for Cowboy Clip Art
to
deliver you an ad.
If you do not want the benefit
of
cookies, there is a simple
procedure to manually delete
your
cookies. Please consult your web browser's
Help
documentation for more
information.
If you have any
additional questions about
Cowboy Clip Art's dedication to
consumer
privacy, please
