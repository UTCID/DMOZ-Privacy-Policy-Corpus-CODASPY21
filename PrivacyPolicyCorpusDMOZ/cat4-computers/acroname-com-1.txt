Acroname Privacy Policy
Acroname respects the privacy of our customers so, rest assured, the information you provide when placing an order will never be shared or sold. The information gathered will be used for processing your order and nothing more. You may chose to receive further marketing emails from us, but we will never share this information with anyone else.
When design engineering for our clients, Acroname adheres to stringent confidentiality requirements. We may occasionally enter into NDA agreements if they are fully specified and absolutely necessary. While we like to share our accomplishments with the world, we will only do so with your permission. In many cases the work that we do for our clients is proprietary and must be kept confidential.
