Terms & Conditions
Definitions
The "Company" shall refer to 2020 Software Ltd of Unit 1D Three Rock Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland. The "Customer" shall refer to any person, firm or company to whom the Company sells goods or services.
Conditions Applicable
Unless agreed in writing, by the Company, these conditions shall prevail over any conditions stipulated by the Customer.
Law
This Contract shall in all respects be construed and operate as an Irish Contract, conform to and be governed by Irish law and be subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.
Specific Condition Of Sale
The Company reserves the right to decline to trade with any company or person. In the event that the Company declines to accept an order in respect of which payment has been received, the full amount of such payments will be refunded.
Returns
Any Goods to be returned must have an RMA number which must be obtained from the Company and this number must be quoted on all correspondence, return notes, advice's and packaging. RMA numbers are only valid for 7 days from the date of issue. Any goods, approved by the Company, for return must be advised in writing, quoting the Company invoice number. The Company disclaims liability whilst in transit to the Company. The Company reserves the right to charge a reasonable handling charge where this is justified. Goods returned for replacement or credit when supplied correctly will be subject to a restocking fee.
Cancellations
The Customer shall not be entitled to cancel an order once placed, in whole or in part, except by prior agreement with the Company and against payment of a reasonable cancellation charge to be specified by the Company
Force Majeure
The Company will not be responsible for damage, delays or non performance directly or indirectly caused by lack of adequate instructions from Customers, governmental regulations or requirements, unavailability of material, work stoppages, strikes, slow-downs, boycotts and other causes (whether or not similar in nature to any of those herein before specified) beyond the Company's reasonable control and in such case may wholly or partially suspend shipment of goods or equipment.
Delivery
Any delivery date quoted is not guaranteed nor is the time quoted for delivery a condition of the Contract. The Company will not be liable for any failure to meet a delivery date nor for loss or consequential loss of any kind arising from a delay in delivery howsoever caused.
Non-Delivery
The Customer has 7 days from the date of delivery to inform the Company of any discrepancy in the quantity delivered.
Price & Quotations
Any price quoted may, unless otherwise stated as fixed in the quotation, be varied by the Company in accordance with cost variations incurred between the date of quotation and receipt by the Company of any subsequent order. Delivery costs are not included in any quotation unless specifically stated and will be charged extra.
Retention Of Title
All goods supplied by the Company shall remain the property of the Company until payment is made in full for all sums due under the Contract between the Company and the Customer. The Customer shall hold all Goods, property in which title remains with the Company as bailee (and, for the avoidance of doubt, fiduciary) for the Company. The Customer shall store the same in such a way that it can be identified as the Company's property and shall keep it separate from the Customer's own property and the property of any other person.
At any time whatsoever the Company shall be entitled to recover Goods in which title remains in the Company and for that purpose the Customer hereby grants to the Company, its agents and employees an irrevocable licence to enter any premises where such goods are stored in order to repossess the same. If, in the normal course of business, the Customer shall sell the Goods in which title remains (prior to such sales) in the Company: (A1) the Customer shall hold on trust for the Company absolutely all the benefit and/or rights arising under any such contract of sale. (A2) the Customer shall hold on trust for the Company absolutely all proceeds of any such Contract of sale and shall pay the same into a separate bank account ("the trust account")(which shall at no time have paid into it monies other than the monies held on trust for the Company and shall at no time be overdrawn) as trustee for the Company. If, as a result of the exercise of its rights referred to above (A1) & (A2), the Company received any monies, the same will not in whole or in part discharge. (1) any of the Customer's liability to pay the purchase price under this or any other contract between the Company and the Customer or (2) any other debts owed by the Customer to the Company. However, if as a result of payment by the Customer of all or part of the monies owed by it to the Company under this or any other contract together with receipt by the Company of monies as a result of or of the exercise if its right under (A1) and/or (A2) above, the Company received in total monies exceeding in amount the Customer's contractual debts to it, the Company shall pay to the Customer a sum equivalent to such excess. The Customer's rights to use or sell the Goods are automatically revoked on the appointment of any administrative receiver to the Customer.
Payment Terms
The Customer is liable to pay for all goods supplied to him by the Company in accordance with the settlement terms agreed in writing with the Company. If payment is not made in accordance with the agreed terms, the Company shall be entitled to charge interest on the amount due and future credit will be withdrawn.
Warranty
In respect of new goods, which carry a manufacturers warranty, the company shall endeavour to transfer the benefits of such warranty to the customer.
