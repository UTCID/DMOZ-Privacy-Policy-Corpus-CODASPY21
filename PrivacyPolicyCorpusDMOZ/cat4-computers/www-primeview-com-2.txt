SEO
Local SEO
Local Search Engine Optimization works similarly with traditional SEO. However, the difference lies in the results they generate. Traditional SEO works at providing trusted and high-quality content, whereas Local SEO aims to present results that are geographically relevant to the searcher.
National SEO
National SEO is a long-term investment that focuses less on ranking for specific geographic areas and more on ranking for broad keywords. Although similar to local SEO, National SEO is more competitive. The right strategy can extend your reach across continents and greatly expand your customer base.
