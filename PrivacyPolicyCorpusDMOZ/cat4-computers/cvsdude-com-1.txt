Terms of Service
COLLABNET LICENSE AGREEMENT
The Service. These Terms of Service state the terms and conditions under which CollabNet will provide the CloudForge service to you ("CloudForge Service"). Please read these Terms of Service carefully. Please also note that these Terms of Service incorporate the Privacy Policy the Data Confidentiality Agreement, and the Acceptable Use Policy .  It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service on a frequent basis to ensure compliance. Your access to and use of the CloudForge Service are expressly conditioned on your compliance with these Terms of Service.
Changes. At any time CollabNet may supplement or amend these Terms of Service. Out of courtesy, CollabNet will provide notice to you of any changes affecting cancellation or payment of fees by email to the email address nominated by you in your registration form. You should ensure that your nominated email address is always current and up to date. Changes requested by you to the Terms of Service must be agreed to in writing by CollabNet.
Accuracy of your registration information. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the registration form ("Registration Data"), which you will fill out online in order to gain access to the CloudForge Service. You should maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete.
Account ownership. In completing the Registration Data, you will be asked to specify an Account Owner. You acknowledge and agree that in the event of any dispute regarding ownership of or entitlement to access your account, CollabNet will defer to the current nominated Account Owner. If there are any changes to the Account Owner, you must notify CollabNet to ensure your Registration Data is updated.
Email and notices. When providing legal notices to you, CollabNet will either post them on the CloudForge website or send an email to the address currently listed in your Registration Data.
Account security. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the CloudForge Service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your password, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify CollabNet of any unauthorized use of your password. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data to CollabNet, it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate with and/or utilize the CloudForge Service.
Account name change. You may change your "Organization Name" (also referred to as the "Long Name") at any time by contacting CollabNet support. Changing your "System Name" (also referred to as "short name" or "alias") will incur a $150 System Change fee, for technical reasons described at "Account / Organization Name Change Policy" in the CloudForge Community Help.
Billing. CollabNet charges and collects for the CloudForge Service in advance under your agreed CloudForge plan. You can elect to purchase the CloudForge Service under your agreed CloudForge plan either for one month, one year, or multiple years (although if you purchase the CloudForge Service for multiple years, you must pay via wire transfer or check, not via credit card). On the renewal date CollabNet will automatically renew the plan and bill your nominated payment method. If you do not wish to renew then you must cancel your plan according to terms outlined in Clause 11 (below) a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours prior to the renewal date. Unless specified otherwise, all fees and charges are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
Grace period. CollabNet allows you a thirty (30) day grace period from the due date of the invoice to bring your balance current. If you do not bring your balance current within this thirty (30) day grace period, CollabNet may use its discretion to suspend your access to the CloudForge Service until the amount outstanding is paid in full. Your obligation to pay for the CloudForge Service continues during the suspension. If the amount outstanding is not paid in full within ninety (90) days of the due date of the invoice, your Account will be automatically archived and canceled by CollabNet (see "Data Archive Following Cancellation" below). You agree and acknowledge that CollabNet has no obligation to retain your Data.
"Data" includes all data stored by you through use of the CloudForge Service.
Changes to your payment details. If you want to change your method of payment or other payment details, you may edit your information by accessing your "Billing" page on the CloudForge website. If your credit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the CloudForge Service constitutes your authorization for CollabNet to continue billing that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.
Account cancellation. Your
CloudForge account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel the
account or CollabNet terminates your account. You may cancel your plan at any
time from within the "Billing" page of the CloudForge application, or
by notifying CollabNet Support in writing or by email. You must cancel your
CloudForge account at least forty-eight (48) hours before the end of your
billing cycle anniversary date in order to avoid billing of the next cycle's
fees to your credit card or nominated payment method.
Data archive following cancellation. When you cancel your account, your service will be cancelled and your Data will be promptly deleted in accordance with applicable law, and you agreed that you will hold CollabNet harmless from any claims of loss or damage due to such Data destruction.
Free accounts.
If you maintain an account previously offered by CollabNet free of charge (“Free Account”), you may continue to use such Free Account provided that you remain an active user of the system.
CollabNet reserves the right to terminate Free Accounts that have not been actively used for a period of three (3) months.
If a Free Account is inactive for three (3) months, then CollabNet reserves the right to delete your account and all data contained within, without notice.
Upgrade/downgrade.
Upgrade plan level: You can upgrade at any time to a higher level of
service under a new CloudForge plan that is at least of the same duration
as your existing plan. Existing system credit will be applied towards
upgraded service level, and the difference between the old and new plans
will be charged on a pro-rata basis. Your billing cycle will remain the same.
Upgrading your plan term: You can upgrade at any time to a longer plan term
(e.g., from monthly to quarterly or annually/multi-annually). The upgrade
to plan length will occur at the end of the next billing cycle and the
new billing cycle of extended duration will commence from this
anniversary date (e.g., if you opt to increase from monthly to annually
and your current billing cycle ends on January 5, the new annual billing
cycle will commence from this date so that the next billing cycle will not
conclude until January 5 on the following year).
Upgrade plan level and increase plan term: You can upgrade at any time to a higher level of
service under a new CloudForge plan and also increase your plan term
(e.g., from monthly to quarterly or annually). The upgrade to the plan
level will occur immediately and existing system credit will be applied
towards upgraded service level, with the difference between the old and
new plans charged on a pro-rata basis.  Your billing cycles will be
modified in the same manner as indicated in subsection b. above.
Upgrade plan level but reduce plan term: You can upgrade at any time to a higher level of
service under a new CloudForge plan and also change the billing cycle
(e.g., monthly instead of quarterly). Existing system credit will be
applied towards your upgraded service level, and the difference between
the old and new plans will be charged on a pro-rata basis. Your billing cycle
will be re-set so that the date on which you are billed will commence
from the day that you nominate to upgrade to the higher plan and change
the billing cycle (e.g., if you make this nomination on January 5 and opt
to go to a monthly cycle, the next billing date will be February 5. If
you make this nomination on January 31, then the next billing date will
be February 28 and the following billing date will be March 31).
Downgrade plan level: You may request a downgrade to your CloudForge plan
at any time within the current billing cycle up to and including the
seven (7) day period at the end of your billing cycle. However, the
downgrade will not take effect until the end of the current billing
cycle. The billing cycle end will remain unchanged
Your responsibilities. You acknowledge and agree that you should not rely on the CloudForge Service for any reason. You further acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting all Data that is stored, retrieved or otherwise processed by the CloudForge Service. Without limiting this, you will be responsible for all costs and expenses that you or others may incur with respect to backing up, and restoring and/or recreating any Data and information that is lost or corrupted as a result of your use of the CloudForge Service.

You agree that CollabNet is not responsible for any electronic communications and/or Data which are lost, altered, intercepted or stored without authorization during the transmission of any Data across networks not owned and/or operated by CollabNet.

We have used CloudForge for several years and in that time we've found their services to be absolutely essential. CloudForge is reliable, easy to work with, and generally excellent. We look forward to a continued partnership.
- Dianna Carroll, QA Manager, Harman International
CloudForge has been hosting our project for over a year now and have been consistently reliable and fast. Tech support has been knowledgeable and friendly, and ludicrously quick; instead of hassling with Trac upgrades, backups and post-commit hooks we've been able just to get on with development. First-class job -thanks!
