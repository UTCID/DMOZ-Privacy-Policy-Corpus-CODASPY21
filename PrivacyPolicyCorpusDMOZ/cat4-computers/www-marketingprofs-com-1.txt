5. Use of the MarketingProfs “Know-How Exchange”. The MarketingProfs Know-How Exchange (the “Exchange”) is a collaborative community where experts answer your difficult marketing questions. Access to and use of the Exchange is subject to this paragraph 4, in addition to the other terms and conditions listed.
Rights and Responsibilities of MarketingProfs:
MarketingProfs is not the publisher or author of any works posted on the Exchange. It is a passive service for storage and dissemination of the works that MarketingProfs users may choose to post and distribute via the Exchange. MarketingProfs does not screen works before they are posted, and no prior approval is required for posting. MarketingProfs disclaims all copyright and ownership in such works and all responsibility for them.
Although it cannot make an absolute guarantee of system security, MarketingProfs takes reasonable steps to maintain security. If you have reason to believe system security has been breached, contact us by email for help.
If the MarketingProfs technical staff finds that files or processes belonging to a user pose a threat to the proper technical operation of the system or to the security of other users, MarketingProfs reserves the right to delete those files or to stop those processes. If the MarketingProfs technical staff suspects an account is being used by someone who is not authorized by the account holder, MarketingProfs may temporarily disable that account in order to preserve system security. In all such cases, MarketingProfs will contact the user as soon as feasible.
MarketingProfs has the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (i) edit, redact, or otherwise change the content of any works posted on the Exchange, (ii) re-categorize any post to place it in a more appropriate category, or (iii) delete any post that is determined to be inappropriate, including but not limited to works that use offensive language and works that are advertisements.
MarketingProfs reserves the right to refuse service to anyone and to cancel an account at any time.
Rights and Responsibilities of MarketingProfs Users or Other Posters to the Exchange:
You are legally and ethically responsible for any works - writings, files, pictures, or any other work - that you post or transmit on the Exchange (or any other MarketingProfs service that allows interaction or dissemination of information). In posting works on the Exchange, you are responsible for honoring the rights of others, including intellectual-property rights (copyright, patent, and trademark), the right to privacy, the right not to be libeled or slandered. For example, if you wish to post a copyrighted work on the Exchange, you are responsible for obtaining the copyright holder's permission first.
Under United States Federal law, you retain copyright on all works you create and post to the Exchange, unless you choose specifically to renounce it. In posting a work on the Exchange, you authorize other users who have access to that service to make personal and customary use of the work, including creating links or reposting, but not otherwise to reproduce or disseminate it unless you give permission for such dissemination. You also give permission to MarketingProfs to copy your works as part of the normal backup process. You have the right to remove any of your works from the Exchange at any time.
The use of your MarketingProfs services or posting on the Exchange for any illegal activity under the laws of Delaware and the United States is a violation of these Terms of Use. Since the law as to jurisdiction of online systems is unsettled, we urge you to consider the possible effect of laws outside MarketingProfs, LLC locality or your own residence. MarketingProfs is open to users worldwide (and works published on the World Wide Web, Usenet, or other such services are accessible to anyone on the Internet), and MarketingProfs cannot guarantee that you won't run into legal trouble from other jurisdictions over your works.
Your Rights and Responsibilities as a MarketingProfs User and Reader of Postings on the Exchange:
You are not required to provide your real name when signing up as a user of MarketingProfs. MarketingProfs permits anonymous or pseudonymous accounts. Any user may request that such user’s email address be hidden to provide for additional privacy.
If you have a complaint about the behavior or posts of another user, it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve the conflict, typically by contacting that person directly. Normally, MarketingProfs staff will not take a role in mediating conflicts between you and other users. MarketingProfs does not take responsibility for your behavior or that of other users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should such a complaint or conflict arise, the user or users may request that a MarketingProfs moderator intervene and attempt to resolve any dispute. Any such request is not a guarantee that a moderator will (i) intervene, (ii) intervene in a timely manner, (iii) resolve the dispute in favor of one party or the other, or (iv) successfully resolve the situation . The decision to intervene rests with MarketingProfs, in its sole and absolute discretion.
Your access to the works that users have posted on the Exchange is for your personal use only. If you want to redistribute works you find on the Exchange, it is your responsibility to obtain permission from the poster (and any other person with rights in such work).
You agree to help protect your account and the security of other users by guarding your password. If you have reason to believe your password has been compromised or there has been any unauthorized use of your account, contact MarketingProfs via
EMAIL as soon as possible.
