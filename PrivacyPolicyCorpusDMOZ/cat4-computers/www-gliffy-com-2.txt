("Gliffy", "we", "us", "our") and the products and services Gliffy provides. Gliffy knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Gliffy website, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?This Privacy Policy covers Gliffy's treatment of personal information that Gliffy gathers when you are on the Gliffy website and when you use Gliffy services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Gliffy's treatment of any personal information that Gliffy's business partners share with Gliffy. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Gliffy does not own or control, or to individuals that Gliffy does not employ or manage.What Personal Information About Users Does Gliffy Collect?Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our service. We collect the following types of information from our users:1. Information You Provide to Us:We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, communicating with you about specials, sales offers and new products, and improving our products and services.We may collect such information from you by the following means:Registration: In order for you to use our website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require your email address.Gliffy Premium: To process your order for Gliffy Premium, we require contact information (such as billing address) and PayPal information. This information is used for billing purposes.Feedback: You may accept our invitation to provide feedback or participate in surveys for our research purposes, including providing screenshots of how you use the Gliffy services.2. Automatic Information:We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Gliffy may automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Gliffy cookie information, and the page you requested. Gliffy uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the website.Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the website, so we can make the website appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our website. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience.Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Gliffy will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.3. E-mail Communications:We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Gliffy if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive e-email or other mail from us, please update your profile under the "Profile" section of the website.4. Information from Other Sources:For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.What About Cookies?Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Gliffy cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your email address is.The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Gliffy's most attractive features.Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.Will Gliffy Share Any of the Information it Receives?We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only with your consent or to the business partners and affiliates as described below:Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction. We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the transaction. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.Personnel:Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of our company business.Agents:We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, collecting and analyzing data relating to your visit to our website, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, and providing customer service. You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal information for the above purposes.We utilize the following Google Analytics Features to help us collect and analyze data related to your visit to our website such as page views and average time on page:Demographics and Interests ReportingRemarketing with Google AnalyticsWe may use this data with third-party cookies such as Adroll and Adwords Remarketing to later serve targeted display banners or text ads to you on the Google Display Network and other ad exchanges such as Facebook.You may opt out of the Google Analytics Features by following the instructions in the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/We may also utilize various analytical tools to track how you interact with the Gliffy website and services.

We also may retain your personal information for a longer period of time on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing or marketing our services to you or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
