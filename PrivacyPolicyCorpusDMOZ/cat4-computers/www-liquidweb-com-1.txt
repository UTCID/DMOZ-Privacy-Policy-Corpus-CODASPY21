Certifications
Liquid Web takes security and compliance seriously. Our commitment to these efforts ensures that anyone choosing Liquid Web can do so with complete confidence.
Below is a list of the certifications that we have earned regarding data and data center security.
SOC 3 Report
In addition to issuing a SOC 2 SSAE 16 report for our clients who may be concerned about our controls regarding their financial statement reporting, Liquid Web also engaged our independent CPA firm to perform a review in order to produce a SOC 3 report. The SOC 3 report offers a slightly more streamlined level of reporting. Our SOC 3 report was produced to address risks related to IT in critical areas including:
Security: The system is protected, both logically and physically, against unauthorized access
Availability: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed to.
