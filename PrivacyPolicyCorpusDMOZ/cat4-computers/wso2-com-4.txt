Cookie Policy
Below is information about how WSO2 uses cookies on this website.
Our website stores and retrieves information on your browser using cookies. This information is used to make the site work as you expect it to. It is not personally identifiable to you, but it can be used to give you a more personalised web experience.
This Cookie Policy is part of our Privacy Policy. It explains:
What are cookies?
A browser cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your device to help websites and mobile apps remember things about you. Other technologies, including Web storage and identifiers associated with your device, may be used for similar purposes. In this policy, we use the term “cookies” to discuss all of these technologies.
What do we use cookies for?
Cookies are used to protect your WSO2 data and account, help us see which features are most popular, counting visitors to a page, improving our users’ experience, keeping our services secure, and to provide you with a better, more intuitive, and satisfying experience.
We use cookies for the following purposes.
Preferences
We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences and to pre-fill the form fields to make your interactions with the site easier for you.
Security
We use these cookies to help identify and prevent security risks.
For example, we may use these cookies to store your session information to prevent others from changing your password without your username and password.
Performance
We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services and to help us improve them.
For example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page.
Analytics
We use these cookies to help us improve our services.
For example, we can use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and which ones might need some tweaks.
Third party cookies
Our website will set several types of third-party cookie, and we do not control the operation of any of them. The third-party cookies which maybe set include:
Google Analytics - we use Google Analytics to collect data about website usage. This data does not include personally identifiable information. You can view the Google Privacy Policy here:
Salesforce Pardot - we use Salesforce Pardot to collect data about website activity. You can view the Salesforce Privacy Policy here:
Demandbase - we use Demandbase to collect data about visitors to wso2.com which includes IP addresses, cookies, and technical information such as browser type. Demandbase’s privacy policy is located here:
What type of cookies do we use?
We use persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to WSO2 or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by WSO2 when you return to one of our sites.
A session cookie is a cookie that is erased when the user closes the Web browser. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from the users computer.
How do I control my cookies?
Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the use of cookies, please contact dpo@wso2.com - Data Protection Officer, WSO2.
