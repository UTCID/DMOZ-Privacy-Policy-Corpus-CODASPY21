the use of endpoint protection software, encryption, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies,
controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing your information, and
training and awareness programs on security and privacy to ensure employees understand the importance of and how to protect your information.
Additionally, all our employees have agreed to observe your privacy and confidentiality rights.
Data Retention
Personal data will be maintained only as necessary to satisfy the reasons for which it was collected. We also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
Cookies
Like many websites, we also use “cookies” and similar technology to, for example, collect additional website usage data and to improve our websites and service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. Some cookies may collect personal data in order to perform their intended functions. For example, in order to enable live chat assistance across multiple Teleran pages, a cookie may collect and store your name and chat history for the session. Teleran may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our websites and our service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our websites, and to improve our websites and services. Authorized third parties may also place their own cookies on our website, and may collect personal information.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, he or she should contact us at webmaster@teleran.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will remove that information.
Links to Other Websites
Our websites contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a third party website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. When you leave Teleran web properties, these other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of personal information that we collect from you through Teleran web properties or that you otherwise provide to Teleran. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the third party websites you visit.
Managing Your Information

You may opt out from the use of your personal information for those non-required communications. Your opt-out choice may be exercised by clicking on the link provided in the emails you receive or by sending an unsubscribe request to webmaster@teleran.com.
