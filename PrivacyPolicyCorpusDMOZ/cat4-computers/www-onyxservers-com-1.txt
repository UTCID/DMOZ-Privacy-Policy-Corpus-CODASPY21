Privacy Policy
Last updated: October, 2014
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how OnyxServers, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "OnyxServers") uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this website (www.OnyxServers.com, the "OnyxServers Site"), any OnyxServers computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the OnyxServers Site ("OnyxServers Software") and any OnyxServers services purchased or otherwise made available from the OnyxServers Site ("OnyxServers Services") (collectively, the "OnyxServers Properties"). This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all Users ("Users") of the OnyxServers Properties.
A. WHAT INFORMATION ONYXSERVERS COLLECTS FROM YOU
OnyxServers may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.
1. "Personal Information". Personal Information refers to information that lets OnyxServers know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). OnyxServers may collect Personal Information when you use the OnyxServers Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with OnyxServers, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.
2. "Non-Personal Information". Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). OnyxServers may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.
B. HOW ONYXSERVERS COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION
The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all OnyxServers' customers worldwide.
1. Registration. Prior to using one or more of the OnyxServers Properties, OnyxServers may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account ("Account") or to enable features or functionality of the OnyxServers Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by OnyxServers may prevent access to any or all OnyxServers Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all OnyxServers Properties.
2. Information Collected Through Technology. While you are able to visit the OnyxServers Site and remain anonymous, OnyxServers or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the OnyxServers Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:
(a) Cookies. Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the OnyxServers Site. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this.

(b) IP Address. You may visit many areas of the OnyxServers Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User. Even in such cases, OnyxServers may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the OnyxServers Site and each time you request one of OnyxServers' pages, the server logs your IP address.
(c) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. OnyxServers may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that OnyxServers sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.
(d) Tracking Content Usage. If you use the OnyxServers Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, "Content") to your website or to a third party website, OnyxServers tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.
