Certain Dassault Systèmes services may be appropriate for use by children, however, in which case children below the age of consent under local data protection laws must seek consent from their parents or guardians prior to creating a Netvibes account or registering a product. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and guardians and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians to do so).

If Dassault Systèmes becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child below the age of consent under local data protection laws without consent from a parent or guardian, Dassault Systèmes will take steps to seek the parents or guardians consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account.
