In response to the data protection accountability and governance principles, Sota has implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure it can demonstrate that it complies with the Regulations. This includes the formulation of Data Protection policies and procedures, whilst also arrying out associated activities such as staff training, internal audits of processing activities and reviews of internal policies.

In all instances, Sota will be able to identify a legitimate interest with respect to the provision of its services and show that the processing is necessary to achieve it, whilst balancing it against the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms. Sota will not in all cases solely rely on legitimate interest as the lawful basis for processing, and
