Mzinga Privacy Policy
Mzinga provides on-demand social intelligence solutions and services in the learning, marketing, and customer experience markets. We take the private nature of your personal information very seriously, and are committed to protecting it. To that end, we’ve set up procedures to ensure that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.
Our privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information “Personal Information” that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our websites and services (collectively, “Mzinga” or “Website”)
Mzinga complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Mzinga has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principals.  If there is any conflict between the terms in the privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principals, the Privacy Shield principals shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit:  www.privacyshield.gov
“Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify an individual. It does not include personal information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public information.
This privacy policy describes what information we collect when you visit Mzinga, how we use that information, and what choices we offer you to access, update, and control it.
INFORMATION COLLECTION
We collect information two ways: Information we get from your use of a Mzinga product offering, and information you provide to us directly from the Mzinga Web Site.
Information we get from your use of Mzinga’s product line is primarily non-personally- identifying information of the sort that web browsers, servers, and third party services typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other non-identifying information that we might have access to includes how you use the Service (e.g. search queries), your approximate location, cookies, etc.
We collect this non-personally-identifying information in order to better understand how visitors use the Service and, where possible, to improve their experience. For instance, we log the time it takes to run database queries so that we can improve performance.
We also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) accessed (which may reference the name of a board, card, or organization), and the unique identification number associated with the account. We don’t use that information to identify you, with one exception: we may discover, by reviewing log files, that a particular account is degrading the experience for all users. If this is discovered, we may look up personally identifiable information associated with that account in order to contact the account owner. We handle and disclose this information in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described below.
Information Provided to Mzinga
Mzinga may collect personal data from customers through a transaction or inquiry, your submission of a form, registrations, or communication to us.  Information may also be gathered from third-party sources (including without limitation, opt-in lists, publicly available data, consumer reporting agencies, other companies, and referrals) and through your activities and interactions with us.  We may combine data collected from these disparate sources unless we tell you otherwise.
The types of personal data typically collected by Mzinga may include the following, depending on your activities:
Contact information, including name, title, street address (home, work), postal code, country, telephone numbers (home, work, cell, etc.), email address (home, work), company name, and other similar information.
Personal/demographic information, e.g. gender, or level of education.
Transactional information, including products or services you inquire about, or request.
User content, including information provided when you use one of our online communities, forums or other online means of communications, and all other user submissions and content you provide.
INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO DISPLAY PUBLICLY
Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of our communities. This could occur through use of the optional profile fields, in interactions or on public discussion boards. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible areas, is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we don’t control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information. It may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like spam.
RIGHTS TO OPT IN/OPT OUT
You have the right to “opt in” and/or “opt out” of certain of our uses of your Personal Information.  For example, you may have the opportunity to elect whether you would like to receive correspondence from us.  You will have the opportunity to opt out of Mzinga’s promotional e-mail by client the “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in the email you receive or clicking on Our Unsubscribe Link. You can also request this by sending an email to privacy@mzinga.com, specifying whether: i) you would like to opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from Mzinga in general, or just via-email, postal mail and/or by phone, and or/whether ii) you would only like to opt out of a certain of Mzinga’s correspondence.
Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications from us.

SECURITY
Mzinga takes appropriate steps to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or destruction, whether in transmission or storage, using commercially reasonable and industry-standard safeguards.

Please keep in mind, however, there is no such thing as perfect security.  Although we are committed to protecting your personal information, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communication vehicle, Mzinga cannot guarantee or warrant information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
