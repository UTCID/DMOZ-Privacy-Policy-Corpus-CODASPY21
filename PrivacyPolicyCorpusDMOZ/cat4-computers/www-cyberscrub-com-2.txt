Protect Your Internet Privacy
Few realize every picture, video clip, chat room conversation and website address is written to your hard drive. Privacy Suite software protects you by removing all evidence of your online Internet history and activity.
“Deleted” Files Remain on Your Computer
Deleted files are easily recovered using simple software tools. Sensitive data, such as passwords, financials or health records, even that “about last night” email are at risk. Don’t allow discovery by a snoop, computer technician or unauthorized persons.
Privacy Suite software allows you to erase data using wipe methods that exceed standards set by the United States Department of Defense for secure file erasure (DoD 5220.22).
New Features
CyberScrub Infinity Safe™ is compatible with cloud providers such like Dropbox®, OneDrive®, iCloud®, GoogleDrive® amongst many others. You control the password so you and ONLY YOU can access your information.
Whether you’re a home user or corporate user, this truly allows you to share files securely.
You can even share files securely with multiple passwords you create and can share as you think fit! You are in complete control!
Create multiple Safes with individual encryption method and your own password
Put your files, documents, pictures encrypted in Dropbox, GoogleDrive, OneDrive, or any other cloud provider
After creating the Infinity Safe, you can go ahead and delete the original unencrypted documents for your own privacy if you wish
Users are referring to this as “Truly a revolutionary product!”
The CyberScrub Dashboard
The new Dashboard alerts you automatically when your privacy is at risk. For example, it will notify you of:
Internet tracks and images that reside on your computer
The need to wipe free space to ensure that previously “deleted” files cannot be recovered
Documents and files that reside in your Recycle Bin
available patches, fixes and updates
You may fix a pending Risk Alert with a single click of your mouse.
Automatically Update and Download Plug-ins
(Note- A “plug-in” allows you to clean traces from third party programs, such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player.)
With older versions of Privacy Suite software, updating your third party plug-ins required waiting for and buying a new program upgrade.
Now with our Yearly Subscription you will receive plug-ins for new and existing programs immediately. A simple click will download and install them. So when, for example, Adobe® Acrobat goes from version 9 to version 10, you will not miss a beat. A 1 Year Subscription is included with your purchase.

New Features
100% Windows 10 Compatibility with Shadow Copy Destruction
Previous versions of Privacy Suite cannot perform even the most basic functions under Windows 7 or Vista. Our new Version 6.0 not only fully supports Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista, but addresses the unique security risks posed by these new operating systems.
For example, Shadow Copies, which are virtual “snapshots” of all user activity and files, pose a particular cause for concern. While many competing products may be able to erase an “original file” beyond recovery, the copy of that file retained within the Volume Shadow Copy is not touched. Privacy Suite not only erases original files but also the associated Shadow Copies that compromise your security and privacy.
Also be aware that competitors’ programs that claim to erase Shadow Copies wipe all Shadow Copies as opposed to only the necessary copies. This not only puts you at an extreme disadvantage if you need to retrieve a non-sensitive file, but also results in the loss of your Restore Points should you need to service your computer. Finally, these competing products require a full free space wipe to complete their erasure process which will take hours. Privacy Suite targets only the Shadow Copies necessary to securely delete your sensitive files, which reduces to time required to protect this aspect of your privacy.
The Dashboard
Older versions of Privacy Suite allowed you to remove evidence of your Internet activity, ensure that previously “deleted” files were non-recoverable, securely erase specific files and destroy the contents of your Recycle Bin. However, it was up to the individual user to have knowledge of these functions and know when to run them.
The new Dashboard provides an unprecedented new level of security. It will automatically notify you at default or custom intervals when you are at risk. It will also alert you of available patches, fixes, updates and upgrades. You can easily address and fix each risk alert with a simple click of your mouse.
Automatically Update and Download Plug-ins
(Note- A “plug-in” allows you to clean traces from third party programs, such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player.)
With earlier versions of Privacy Suite software updating your third party plug-ins required waiting for and buying a new program upgrade.
Now with our Yearly Subscription (optional) you will receive plug-ins for new and existing programs immediately. A simple click will download and install. So when, for example, Adobe® Acrobat goes from version 8 to version 9, you will not miss a beat. A 90 Day Free Subscription is included.
Are you using Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome 44 or Firefox 41?
If you do not have Privacy Suite 5.1 /6.0, you are at risk. Older versions of our software cannot remove traces from these popular browsers. The new Privacy Suite 6.0 brings enhanced methods to remove history from these popular apps.
Are you using Windows Media Player 11?
Dated versions of Privacy Suite cannot remove traces from viewing video clips or streaming media.
