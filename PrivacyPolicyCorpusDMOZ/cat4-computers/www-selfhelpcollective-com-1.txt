clowns or fear of flowers?...

12. Fear of
driving*1
I
don't like driving, but I don't fear it. Perhaps this is about fear of being stuck
in a traffic jam (gridlock)
13.
Fear of dogs*1
Cynophobia
Nope.
I love dogs, me. But then I grew up with a dog. And maybe that's all that's needed
here, or... maybe this is about fear of Rottweilers! :-O

Fear of dentists*1
Odonto-phobia,
Dentophobia
This
is a fear I share, I will happily admit.
But not to a dentist. I always
give them 'the steely eye!' stare!
Could
this be a man looking at dentist with
a snake wrapped around his neck?

18. Fear of
water*1
Aquaphobia
Isn't
this really the fear of drowning, or are we talking about splashes of water sending

19.
Fear of god, of the lord*3
Zeuso-phobia
I
think you are actively encouraged to have this fear, ain't ya?
20.

one of the very few instinctive fears in this list.
21.
Fear of long words*5
Hippopoto-monstro-

I couldn't!)

24.
Fear of change*3
Neophobia
A.k.a.
fear of anything new.
So I really hope someone suffering from this
fear hasn't chanced upon all these new fears....
25.
Fear of germs*1
Mysophobia
Cough,
cough, sneeze! Swine-flu anyone?
26.
Fear of music*5
This
must be an awful fear to suffer from. Imagine not liking music. Fans of [Insert
name of pop band you hate here] don't need to imagine, eh!
27. Fear of
doctors*1
Iatrophobia
I
think this is fear of what Doctors can do to us and/or what they can make us do
to ourselves.
(Or maybe it's the white coats that they wear?)
28.
Fear of crowds*2
Agora-phobia,
Enochlo-phobia
Got
to admit, that as soon as I 'feel' there are too many people nearby - like in
a large mall, or at a music concert - I feel a strong urge to leave.
How
about you?
29.
Fear of being touched*2
Haphe-phobia,
Aphe-phobia...
Again,
not a nice fear to have. Especially if it means that you never get touched!.
30.
Fear of open spaces*2
Agora-phobia
Same
as fear of crowds, apparently. Hmm, I think someone's messin' with me 'fancy dan
' names, here- these fears can't be the same. Can they?

Fear of looking at lists of fears?
* 'MOST COMMON FEARS'
NOTES:
(A) I grouped these fears into various types. And those
types of fear are the following:
1. Pain
Fear 2. Relational Pain Fear 3. Self-Loathing Fear,
and 4. Innate Fears (i.e. fears we were born with). And then I added...5.
Strange fears, for those odd fears that I could not easily explain!
Of
course, if you disagree with my types of fear then please do let me know! I won't
bite, promise! Or if you have any other comments, for that matter. You can contact
me about these fears!
(B) How did I come
up with this list of common fears?
Well... I used a keyword research
tool, that's how. I simply determined the number of searches people made on
the major search engines, and ordered it accordingly.
I actually used a tool
with the snappy name of Brainstorm It! don't you know - that comes as part of a suite of internet business-building tools collectively known as SBI! - and my list is ordered
by what is known as 'Value Demand'. (And I talk about SBI! on this SBI! self-improvement page, should you be interested!)
So, the list of fears above derives from the most
common SEARCHES for fears - including "list of fears". Okay, I admit that it isn't that scientific,
but it's still an interesting list, nevertheless. No? And if you have a
better list of most common fears then I'd love you to share
them with me!
Overcoming these Most Common Fears...
It's
interesting to note that the majority of these most common fears are not innate; i.e.
we have learned to have these fears. Which means the good news is that we can
learn to not have them.
And that's why I've also included links to the Hypnosis Downloads website (HypnosisDownloads.com helping people since 1995 - read this page to see how self-hypnosis works) to help you overcome these fears.
