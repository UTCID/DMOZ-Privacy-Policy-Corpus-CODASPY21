Re:    Request for investigation into data broker products for
compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act  Dear Commissioners, In recent years, there has been an explosion in the creation and use of dossiers
of personal information to evaluate individuals.  Some of these dossiers,
known as "data products," in the information brokerage industry,
are designed to be sold so that they avoid triggering the provisions of Fair
Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA), a landmark law that ensures that compilations
of personal information used for many different purposes are accurate, correctable,
fairly collected.  Additionally, the FCRA mandates that information collectors
be accountable for their practices.  Commercial data broker ChoicePoint, for instance, is selling data products
that are used by law enforcement, government, and the private sector to make
important decisions about people.  ChoicePoint,[1] one of the largest data aggregation
companies, became independent from Equifax, a leading U.S. credit rating agency,
in 1997.[2]  ChoicePoint has bought more than 40 companies and competitors,
and obtains 40,000 new public records daily for its database of more than
19 billion records.[3]  Choicepoint contracts with
about 35 federal agencies to supply data.[4]The company's slogan is "Smarter Decisions.
Safer World."  However, decisions cannot be smarter, and we cannot be
safer, if these new data products are not subject to the basic fairness requirements
incorporated in the FCRA.
In 1970, Congress passed the FCRA in response to a litany of problems and
complaints about credit reporting agencies.[5]
The opening of the FCRA states:
The Congress makes the following findings: (1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting.
Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking
system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence
which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. (2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating
the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and
general reputation of consumers. (3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling
and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. (4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise
their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect
for the consumer's right to privacy. 15 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (1970).
Americans face a return to the pre-FCRA era if companies like ChoicePoint
can amass dossiers on Americans without compliance with any regime of Fair
Information Practices.  That era was marked by unaccountable data companies
that reported inaccurate, falsified, and irrelevant information on Americans,
sometimes deliberately to drive up the prices of insurance or credit.[6]
To some extent, this pre-FCRA area has returned.  For instance, erroneous
ChoicePoint data sold without the FCRA's protections were relied upon in Florida
to cleanse voting registration rolls of felons prior to the 2000 election,
resulting in the disenfranchisement of thousands of eligible voters.[7] In an appendix to this letter, we explain ChoicePoint's
business activities.[8]  ChoicePoint sells a number of FCRA products
in the employment screening, tenant screening, and criminal background check
fields.  But the company also sells two products, "AutoTrackXP"
and "Customer Identification Programs" outside of the FCRA's protections.
AutoTrackXP is a database of 17 billion records that includes Social Security
Number, addresses, property and vehicle information, and other information.[9]  The company's anti-fraud "Customer Identification Programs"
are a suite of data products that have been created in order to verify the
identity and perform background checks on individuals who open new financial
services accounts. [10]  From its description, Customer Identification
Programs appears to be an AutoTrackXP report with additional identity verification
services.  These two products are sold to financial institutions, members of the public
(private investigators, law firms, etc.) and to law enforcement agencies.
These are the same institutions which rely on credit reports and investigative
consumer reports, but these new products are sold outside the protections
of the FCRA, yet are often used for related (and sometimes identical) purposes.
It is difficult to determine what sources ChoicePoint used to create AutoTrackXP
and Customer Identification Programs.  However, both of these non-FCRA products
have similar data elements and descriptions as ChoicePoint's FCRA products.
The similarities between the information in an AutoTrackXP report and the
company's FCRA products is striking; it suggests that AutoTrackXP was generated
from FCRA sources.[11] Under a well-developed line of cases, courts interpreting the FCRA have held
that if a data product originates from a consumer report database, the product
remains protected by the FCRA.  For instance, the D.C. Circuit held in Trans
Union v. FTC that marketing lists drawn from a credit reporting agency's
master databases were "credit reports" for purposes of the FCRA.[12] If ChoicePoint had created AutoTrackXP or its Customer Identification Programs
from FCRA sources, the products should be considered "consumer reports"
for purposes of the FCRA.  Consumers could exercise a series of important
rights with respect to their ChoicePoint reports that are not currently available.
Only the FTC can determine the "information flows" or sources of
data used by ChoicePoint, and whether the company has leaked data from the
FCRA products to AutoTrackXP and Customer Identification Programs.  We urge
the Commission to engage in this inquiry. Even if these products are not consumer reports for purposes of the FCRA,
it is incumbent on the FTC to analyze them and make recommendations to Congress
concerning possible expansion of the FCRA.  If these products are found not
to be within the FCRA, the FTC should recommend to Congress to expand the
scope of the Act.
Many of the public policy purposes underlying the FCRA are being circumvented
by data brokers who have artfully constructed databases to avoid the Act's
provisions.  For instance, the use of data products for voter registration
list cleansing implicates the most important right in a democracy—access to
the polls.  If such a use is not covered by the FCRA, this creates an absurd
consequence. Someone denied access to a credit card would enjoy access, correction,
and other FCRA rights, while another person denied access to the voting polls
would have no federal information privacy rights. Other absurd consequences emerge from this end-run around the protections
of the FCRA.  Although the FCRA regulates law enforcement access to consumer
report information,[13] the
FBI has concluded that information it buys from ChoicePoint is not subject
to the FCRA.[14]  In effect, the FBI has circumvented the FCRA by purchasing
data from AutoTrackXP -- data that is often identical to what appears in a
credit report from one of the "big three" agencies.  Why would law
enforcement agencies continue to comply with fair procedures in the FCRA for
access to consumer data when they can get unaccountable, open-door access
to the same information at ChoicePoint? The use of these data products by law enforcement officials, government agencies,
private investigators, and others raise the same concerns that prompted Congress
to pass the FCRA.  Errors in reports provided by ChoicePoint and similar companies
can find their way into other databases, resulting in the potential for improper
arrest and even imprisonment.  People have been wrongly arrested and jailed
due to errors in law enforcement databases.[15]  Since information often circulates between
law enforcement records and commercial databases, erroneous information in
a database such as AutoTrackXP can make its way into a series of other databases,
with profoundly harmful effects on people’s lives.  For example, consider
the following incident:
[A] Maryland woman wrongly arrested for a burglary was not cleared from
the state’s criminal databases. Her name and SSN also migrated to a Baltimore
County database relating to child protective services cases. She was fired
from her job as a substitute teacher, and only after she could establish
that the information was in error was she rehired. When she later left that
job to run a day care center for the U.S. military, she was subject to questioning
about the erroneous arrest. Later on, when employed at as a child care director
at a YMCA, she was terminated when her arrest record surfaced in a background
clearance check. Since she could not have the error expunged in sufficient
time, the job was given to another person. Only after several years was
the error finally cleared from the public records.[16]
Finally, we note that under the self-regulatory scheme erected by the now
defunct Individual Reference Services Group, commercial data brokers choose
who is eligible to buy personal information.  This is a subtle but important
deviation from the Fair Credit Reporting Act's approach, which tends to approve
record disclosure based on the use of the information, rather than the identity
of the purchaser.  The importance of this difference becomes clear when it
is understood that private investigators, major buyers of personal information,
are not licensed in all fifty states, and in some states that require licensure,
it is a pro forma process.[17]
As a result, ChoicePoint and other information brokers can create ties with
marginal businesses or private investigators with dubious backgrounds.  Based
on their status of being a private investigator, a paralegal, or a law enforcement
agent, ChoicePoint's customers can pull information on almost anyone without
having to declare their legal justification or entitlement to the data. We encourage the Commission to examine access to commercial data broker information
in light of the Amy Boyer case, where a Florida information broker sold data
to the man who stalked and killed Amy Boyer.[18]
If the sale of Ms. Boyer's Social Security Number and other information to
a complete stranger were conditioned upon one of the FCRA's permissible uses
of data, perhaps she would be alive today.  The FCRA's reasonable limitations
on the use of data, if applied to this sector of data brokers, could protect
individuals from unwarranted access to and sale of personal information. Again, we urge the Commission to engage in a serious inquiry on the status
of data brokers' products.  We believe that some of these products may be
"consumer reports" for purposes of the FCRA, thus subjecting both
the seller and the buyer to regulation under the Act.  We also think it incumbent
upon the Commission to analyze whether the sale of these new data products
circumvents the FCRA, giving businesses, private investigators, and law enforcement
access to data that previously had been subjected to Fair Information Practices. We look forward to hearing from you on this matter, and please contact us
if we can provide more information. Sincerely,
Chris Jay Hoofnagle

Appendix I.
ChoicePoint ChoicePoint,[1] one of the largest data aggregation companies,
became independent from Equifax, a leading U.S. credit rating agency, in 1997.[2]  ChoicePoint has bought more than
40 companies and competitors, and obtains 40,000 new public records daily
to insert into its database of more than 19 billion records.[3]
Its business and government services division offers through its AutoTrackXP
product identity verification, property records, bankruptcy records, licenses,
liens, judgments, and other records to local, state and federal law enforcement,[4] including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.[5]
It also advertises the AutoTrackXP product as a solution for financial services
anti-fraud and anti-money laundering compliance.[6] ChoicePoint's roots are in information services to the insurance sector.
The company stated in its initial Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that:
ChoicePoint's operations have historically consisted of database
information and inspection and investigative services supplied primarily to
the insurance industry. ChoicePoint believes it can enhance future growth
and profitability by offering a broader range of risk assessment services,
fraud management information and technology solutions to clients outside of
the insurance industry. Although Equifax believes that significant growth
opportunities exist for ChoicePoint's products and services, it anticipates
that marketing and promotion of these services will be necessary. The public
perceives, however, that credit reporting services and the more privacy sensitive
services offered by ChoicePoint should not be available from a single provider.[7] Since its spinoff from Equifax, ChoicePoint has acquired a number of information
collection and processing companies.[8]
As a provider of personal information to the insurance sector, from its inception,
ChoicePoint's activities have been subject to the FCRA.[9] II.
ChoicePoint's FCRA Business Activities ChoicePoint sells a number of information products in the employment screening,
tenant screening, and personal insurance areas.  Many of these information
products are FCRA databases and require both ChoicePoint and the company's
clients to comply with the Act.  This section summarizes ChoicePoint's FCRA
employment screening, tenant screening, and personal insurance products.
The next section turns to AutoTrackXP and "Customer Identification Programs,"
ChoicePoint's non-FCRA data products that are similar to the company's FCRA
employment, tenant, and insurance screening products.
A.
ChoicePoint's "CP Online" Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a pre-employment screening service named
"CP Online."  The company claims that that product is FCRA-compliant:
ChoicePoint Online is a comprehensive Web-based screening interface designed
to help employers meet their pre-employment screening needs regarding background
verification and drug testing administration. ChoicePoint Online is FCRA-compliant
and offers easy-to-use data entry screens, duplicate request notification
and alerts for possible criminal records. Using ChoicePoint Online's interactive
ordering system, flexible reporting options, process monitoring and online
billing, users can gain valuable information to help make better decisions
and employ more efficient hiring practices.[10]
…* FCRA Summary of Consumer Rights attached to all decisional reports
ChoicePoint lists the following databases as being available for pre-employment
search through the CPOnline product:
Stanton® Assessments
State Law Reference Library
National Criminal File
Driver Qualification File
Criminal Background Checks
Identity Verification
MVRs
Credit History
Employment Verification
Education Verification
Military History
Worker's Compensation
License, Credentials and Certification Verification
Business or Personal Reference Verification[11]
B.
ChoicePoint's "National Criminal File" Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a pre-employment screening service named
"National Criminal File."  The company
claims that that product is FCRA-compliant:
ChoicePoint National Criminal File is a comprehensive search of multiple
criminal record sources, including fugitive file, state and county criminal
record repositories, ChoicePoint proprietary criminal record information,
prison, parole and release files from state Department of Corrections, Administrative
Office of Courts and other state agencies. Key Features & Benefits     * Access to more than 100 million criminal conviction records across
all 50 states     * National reach at an economically feasible price     * FCRA Compliant…[12]
C.
ChoicePoint's "Resident Data" Screening Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a tenant screening service named "Resident
Data."  The company claims that that product is FCRA-compliant:
Resident Data is an industry leader in apartment resident screening and
debt collections. Our mission is to maximize customer profitability by managing
resident profile risk, collecting maximum payments from residents who default,
and creating an environment of resident accountability. Our integrated screening, skip watch and collections solutions enable apartment
owners and managers to better direct their properties by providing flexible
solutions that adapt to the individual needs of the community. Resident Data helps reduce liability by improving compliance with FCRA
and Fair Housing requirements.[13]
ChoicePoint lists the following data elements as being available for tenant
screening through the "Resident Data" product:
Access to Criminal, Registered Sex Offender and Eviction Databases. […]     * Online access to more than 77 million criminal records, State and
county criminal record repositories.     * 39 States of Registered Sex Offender Records.     * FBI Terrorism Watch List - Including FBI Most Wanted list and FBI
Terrorist database list.     * Proprietary records from ChoicePoint's other screening business results.     * Offender and offense descriptions. […] National Eviction Search ChoicePoint has more than 10 million current records from 45 states. The
data includes initial filings, dispossessory warrants and property actions.
Resident Data searches every state where the applicant has a prior address
as part of its search, not just the state where the applicant is applying. […] Unit Application Analysis For roommates or multiple applicants, the Resident Data system evaluates
all applicants on a per-unit basis and presents a recommendation for the
group. Individual screening outcomes are also noted on the report. […] Occupant Processing Resident Data also offers occupant screening to protect your property from
potential problem residents who are not financially responsible for a lease.
We can provide legally compliant screening services on potential occupants
without initiating a credit check. […] Maximum Evaluation of the Credit Report The Resident Data review of the credit report includes fraud alerts, SafeScan
warnings for possible Social Security Number problems, landlord or utility
debt, address matching and full review of payment performance.[14]
D.
ChoicePoint's CLUE Personal Auto Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a personal insurance screening service
named "CLUE Personal Auto:"
C.L.U.E. (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) is a claim history
information exchange that enables insurance companies to access prior claim
information in the underwriting and rating process. C.L.U.E. Personal Auto
reports contain up to five years of personal automobile claims matching
the search criteria submitted by the inquiring insurance company. Data provided
in C.L.U.E. reports includes policy information such as name, date of birth
and policy number; claim information such as date of loss, type of loss
and amounts paid; and vehicle information. More than 95 percent of insurers writing automobile coverage provide claims
data to the C.L.U.E. Personal Auto database. By providing immediate interactive
information, C.L.U.E. Personal Auto helps insurers and agents make immediate
business decisions.[15]
The data elements in the CLUE Personal Auto report include: names of other
drivers possible associated with the person applying for insurance, claims
information, vehicle descriptions, and vehicle ownership.[16] E.
ChoicePoint's "Motor Vehicle Records" Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a personal insurance screening service
named "Motor Vehicle Records:"
ChoicePoint provides driving records, including standard violation codes,
from all 50 states and three Canadian provinces in an easy-to-read standardized
format. Online access to driving records is available for 40 states and
two provinces, and ChoicePoint continues to add to the list of states with
online access.[17]
The data elements in the Motor Vehicle Records report include: contact information,
driver license number, physical descriptions of drivers, and additional drivers
that may be associated with the data subject.[18] F.
ChoicePoint's "National Credit File" Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets a product named "National
Credit File:"
ChoicePoint's National Credit File provides insurance carriers with online
consumer credit reports obtained from the three major credit bureaus. Carriers
then consider the financial history of the applicant and assess the applicant's
risk for quoting, underwriting and renewal purposes.[19]
The data elements in the National Credit File report include: contact information,
bankruptcies, public records, liens, collection items, employment information,
and tradelines.[20] III.         ChoicePoint's
Apparent Non-FCRA Products In addition to the FCRA products described above, ChoicePoint markets two
additional, popular data products to law enforcement, financial services companies,
private investigators, law firms, and other businesses.  These products are
known as "AutoTrackXP" and "Customer Identification Programs." A.
ChoicePoint's "AutoTrackXP" Product On its website, ChoicePoint markets "AutoTrackXP", which is described
as:
AutoTrackXP and ChoicePoint Online provide Internet access to more than
17 billion current and historical records on individuals and businesses,
and allow users to browse through those records instantly. With as little
information as a name or Social Security number, both products cross-reference
public and proprietary records including identity verification information,
relatives and associates, corporate information, real property records and
deed transfers. In addition, access is available to a staff of field researches
who perform county, state and federal courthouse searches.[21]
The advertised data elements in AutoTrackXP include:
Discovery PLUS!™ - through ChoicePoint Online     * Compiles a comprehensive report on an individual including current
and previous addresses, relatives, assets, corporate involvement and derogatory
information.     * Returns list where no matches were found.     * Also available Discovery PLUS! with Vehicle Identification Number.
Info:PROBE™ - through ChoicePoint Online     * Checks millions of records simultaneously and provides a "shopping
list" of databases, which contains records that match the search criteria.
A client can then choose which databases to view. […] National Comprehensive Report
– through AutoTrackXP     * Searches national and state databases for a summary of assets, driver
licenses, professional licenses, real property, vehicles, and more.     * Each report offers the ability to add associates to the report, which
include relatives, others linked to the same addresses as the subject and
neighbors.[22]
A sample AutoTrackXP report on the ChoicePoint web site shows that it contains
Social Security Numbers; driver license numbers; address history; phone numbers;
property ownership and transfer records; vehicle, boat, and plane registrations;
UCC filings; financial information such as bankruptcies, liens, and judgments;
professional licenses; business affiliations; "other people who have
used the same address of the subject," "possible licensed drivers
at the subject's address," and information about the data subject's relatives
and neighbors.[23]   The AutoTrackXP
report is very similar in content to a standard credit report issued by one
of the "big three" credit reporting agencies. However, there is no indication that AutoTrackXP is sold within the FCRA's
procedural and substantive safeguards.  ChoicePoint seems to have treated
the data product outside the FCRA and subject only to the now-defunct Individual
Reference Service Group self-regulatory principles.  This means that anyone
with a ChoicePoint account can buy an AutoTrackXP account. It appears that both ChoicePoint and federal law enforcement share the view
that AutoTrackXP is outside the FCRA's protections.  In a document obtained
by EPIC under the Freedom of Information Act from the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the agency concluded that ChoicePoint's products are not covered by the FCRA:
"In this instance, none of the information which the FBI would seek to
review has been collected by ChoicePoint for any of the [FCRA] purposes."[24] B.
ChoicePoint's Customer Identification Programs On its website, ChoicePoint offers "Customer Identification Programs,"
described as a PATRIOT Act compliance mechanism with many data elements similar
to AutoTrackXP:
Identification Solutions Basic identification solutions ensure that name, address, date of birth
and Social Security numbers match. This includes a check against required
government sanctions lists. Enhanced due diligence solutions include telephone
numbers, historical information, criminal records, key relationships, international
information and comprehensive individual and business reports. […] You’ll benefit from our unique offerings, including:     * Access to more than 17 billion public records and three major credit
bureaus.     * An extensive proprietary identity database.     * National real property information.     * Nationwide corporate and business information.     * A vast database of drivers’ license data and motor vehicle records.     * National criminal history database.     * Access to the Office of Foreign Asset Control and other government
sanctions and enforcement actions, including international information.[25]

are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission under the Federal
Fair Credit Reporting Act, and to a lesser extent, by various other federal,
state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal,
state and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not anticipated to
have, a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of ChoicePoint. Nonetheless, federal, state and local regulations
in the United States designed to protect the public from the misutilization
of personal information in the marketplace may increasingly affect the operations
of ChoicePoint, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance and
litigation expense, adverse publicity and a loss of revenue.  Id. [10]ChoicePoint, CP Online, http://www.choicepoint.com/business/pre_employ/pre_employ_2.html. [11] Id.  ChoicePoint offers similar information

In November 2001, ChoicePoint introduced the National Criminal File database,
one that then contained, "more than 20 million conviction records from
jurisdictions around the country."  David J. Cook, then ChoicePoint vice
president, was quoted saying that the National Criminal File was created for
employment screening purposes: "We have two large clients who want to
run a large national criminal search on every one of their employees."
