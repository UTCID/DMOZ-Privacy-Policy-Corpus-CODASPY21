Crash reports are not automatically sent to us, they require the end user to specifically click on the ‘Send Report’ button on the Crash Report dialog.Check for updates requests information about any new updates that might be available. This feature is off by default and requires the end user to either click ‘Check for updates’ or activate periodic update checking through the ‘Automatically check for updates’ option.Some of the above information is used to analyse trends and understand demographic information about our user base so that we can improve our services and usability of our services.
