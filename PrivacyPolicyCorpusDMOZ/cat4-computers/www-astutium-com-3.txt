GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION POLICY - Updated: 25th May 2018
As of 14 April 2016 (enforceable beginning 25 May 2018) the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the existing 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (EDPD).
Because the GDPR is a Regulation, not a Directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation and is directly binding and applicable to all companies trading in Europe.
The GDPR clarifies and strengthen the rights that individuals have regarding personal data relating (data which directly to them) and seeks to unify data protection standards across Europe (and beyond) regardless of where that data is processed/controlled.
Data Controller
Data Controller is the person/organisation which determines what data to collect/store/process and dictates all policies/processes related to that data.
Data Processor
Data Processor is the person/organisation which handles through collection/processing/storage/analysis the data in accordance with the published policies/processes related to that data (as decided by the controller)
Data Subject
Data Subject is any individual (natural) living person.
Personal Information
Personal Information is information which is specifically about a Data Subject
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to identify a Data Subject
Data Breach
Data Breach is the intentional (or accidental) loss of, damage to, or unauthorised sharing of PI/PII.
Supervisory Authority
Supervisory Authority is the territory specific organisation responsible for enforcing the GDPR - For the UK this is currently the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).
The key principles of the GDPR are that PI/PII is:
processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals
collected and processed only for specific lawful purposes
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
accurate and kept up to date
kept for no longer than necessary
kept secure
We respect your privacy and are commited to protecting your Personal Information and Personally Identifiable Information. We have made updates to our policies and procedures in order to remain compliant with our obligations under the GDPR.
