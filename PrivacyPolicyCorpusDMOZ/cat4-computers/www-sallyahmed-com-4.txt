5- Check-in on social channels
As fun as it maybe for your family & friends to know your whereabouts; I would really question the need to tell the world that you are away from your home for two weeks. If you have home security, or someone is actually is still living at your place while you are away on holiday; then maybe. Alternatively, kindly consider not checking-in at airports, remote destinations, or restaurants that clearly shows you are travelling.
4-Click on Links from unknown sources
This also might go without saying, but one would be surprised of how many click on links from emails that land on their inbox as they might have escaped the spam filter. If you are not sure of the email sender and if the content of the email is short and only has a link, this is for sure a link to a spyware or a virus that would be automatically downloaded from the website behind that link. There is no justification for clicking this link, unless there is a child behind the screen, and in this case, make sure your email is not open while your children are playing with your computer.
3- Having OneDrive, Google Drive… etc automatically backup your photos into the cloud
A tech guru might argue this to be a good thing. I have listed this here, cause with how accessible phone camera’s are these days, we take all sorts of photos and not all are actually good for sharing. I personally, took a shot of my toe when it was broken to share with a doctor through What’s App and was shocked to see it up on the oneDrive server on my work laptop because I use the same account for Microsoft office. Luckily; it was just a photo of my toe, and I was not looking for photos with a colleague of mine near by. The wise option is to disable the automatic upload into the Google Drive, or OneDrive, and setup a reminder to backup photos you want into the cloud.
2-Install millions of apps on your phone
Data storage has become cheap; as such many tend to try apps, games, or tools on their phone and leave them around and rarely use them. From a data point of view, it might not seem as an obvious threat. However, app developers might stop supporting an app which means the code becomes outdated and could slow down the device. The app could still be accessing data and the server behind that old app might be hacked. In all cases, one needs to be aware of their usage and if trying out apps, fall into the habit of cleaning the device from unused ones.
1- List family members on Facebook
I must admit, this would not be something that all tech gurus would consider. And many users might actually do even with zero tech background. If you are among the 1.94 billion monthly active users on Facebook (according to May 2017 stats) you can see that the channel enables you to add more details about your family. I have recently written an article about how BigData can control our lives from the recent political standouts that changed the future of the US and the UK. Do please read the article if you haven’t done so. The core of the article flags the data that is available about us on social channels and how it can be used to change our perceptions. I think having your family tree on social channels is just making it even easier to shift your way of thinking, cause such systems can target them to change how you vote.
Data Safety is common sense
The list above is just what my common sense flagged basically. Even if I wasn’t someone in the field I would consider understanding more about the technology that is made available to me. I would also be wary of what goes into my home and how it processes the data it collects… a.k.a Google Home, Amazon Echo.. ! Big Brother !
