Overview
ThinkWave, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our members. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use our service. The policy may be updated occasionally so please check back periodically.
To ensure our members privacy and the security of their information, ThinkWave, Inc. has taken the following precautions:
ThinkWave, Inc. uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to enhance the privacy of grades and class results transmitted online.
We will not sell or share any personal information with any person or organization outside of ThinkWave, Inc.
ThinkWave accounts are password-protected. (Members are responsible for maintaining the security of passwords.)
ThinkWave hosts its data on Google App Engine cloud-computing platform and ThinkWave abides by the privacy policies of Google which are incorporated herein by this reference: http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html.
Security
ThinkWave, Inc. uses individual password-protected accounts and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to enhance the privacy of grades and class results transmitted online.
ThinkWave accounts are all password-protected so that only authorized members are allowed to access or view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ThinkWave does not ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Regretfully, no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed completely secure. Given the inherent operation and structure of the Internet, all transmissions are done at your own risk.
Personal Information
ThinkWave, Inc. is committed to safeguarding personal information online. This information is accessible only by individual parent and student ThinkWave ID's and passwords. ThinkWave will not knowingly and directly ask any student for any personally identifiable information, nor will it require any such information for a student to use or access ThinkWave. However, in order to assist the district, school, or teacher (together the "Staff") in school administration and to track its students’ progress, ThinkWave, at the School’s sole option, allows the Staff (not the student) to input the students’ names. It is up to the Staff to register students to give them access to ThinkWave by proving students and parents with the Start Keys generated by ThinkWave. The students and parents then create their own login and password and attach the Start Key to their account. The Staff, and not ThinkWave, solely control, defines and manages the collection, disclosure, communication, management and use of all data, including personal data on this Site. ThinkWave assumes no responsibility to enter, collect, or review any such data.
