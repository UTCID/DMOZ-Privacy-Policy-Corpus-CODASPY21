Turning up the heat on Web privacyTurning up the heat on Web privacyWhen Microsoft introduced version 6 of its Internet Explorer browser last year, many Webmasters were puzzled to find that their cookies were being blocked in increasing numbers. The culprit was IE's default implementation of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P), and for that, the irate Webmasters had Lorrie Cranor to thank.Posted by rshah on December 05, 2002| Comments (0)

Web sites consider standard privacy disclosureWeb sites consider standard privacy disclosureDozens of the Web's top sites are adopting the Internet's version of nutrition labels, giving visitors a quick sense of how well they honor surfers' personal privacy.

P3P's Arrival Raises ConcernsP3P's Arrival Raises ConcernsWright has developed a method for companies to disclaim or disavow their P3P statements, which otherwise may cause the company unwanted liability.

He said that DSA enables a company to put its privacy policy into P3P format, but then add DSA to the end of the code, effectively saying that the codes have no legal meaning and that users cannot take the company to court over what is expressed in the codes.Posted by rshah on October 05, 2001| Comments (0)

GET IE6CNET and the WSJ discusses Microsoft's decision to limit P3P privacy protection to its forthcoming IE6 browser.
This means that Passport users will have to also use IE6 to take advantage of P3P.
Increasing Passport's reliance on IE6, which is in turn tied to its latest operating system, could also fuel antitrust arguments.Posted by rshah on August 10, 2001| Comments (0)
Putting privacy into practicePutting privacy into practiceTHE RACE IS ON for enterprises with any significant Web presence to make their sites compliant with a new standard called P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences), which mandates that Web sites provide machine-readable versions of data-collection and -sharing practices.
