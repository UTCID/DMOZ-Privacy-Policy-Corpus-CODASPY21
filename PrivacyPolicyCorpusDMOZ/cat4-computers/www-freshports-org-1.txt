Hardware failure
The website is running on the old server. The new server stopped working at about 0200 UTC on 2020-08-22.
The database was restored from 2020-08-21 00:59:15+00 UTC.
We think we have covered all commits. Nothing should be missing.
Any changes you made to your accounts after the restore date will be lost.
Sorry about that.
Privacy statement
All the information we
gather is for our own use.
We do not release it to anyone else.
For example, when you subscribe to our mailing list, we
keep that to ourselves and nobody else will know.
We don't sell our mailing lists.
Or any other private information for that matter.
Most websites gather statistics regarding the number of times a page was accessed.
We do this.
This means your IP address, or the IP address of your proxy will
be recorded in our access logs.
We do not release this information to anyone.
It wouldn't be much use to anyone anyway.
