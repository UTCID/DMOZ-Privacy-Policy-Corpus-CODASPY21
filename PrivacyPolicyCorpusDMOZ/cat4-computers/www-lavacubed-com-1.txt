Frequently Asked Questions
What about the Privacy of children?
Safeguarding the Profile Information of children is extremely important.
LavaCUBED.com collects the minimum amount of Profile Information necessary
to operate the service. A child's Profile Information will be used for operation
of the service but it will never be used for uses related to the site's
service but not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").
There are a number of emerging standards in the area of children's privacy
that will affect how we process a child's Profile Information in the future.
Through its participation in the Online Privacy Alliance,The Lava Network
is monitoring these changes and is redesigning its systems so as to comply
with these new requirements.
Does LavaCUBED.com collect other forms of information about its users?
In addition to the use of Profile Information to operate the site, LavaCUBED.com
also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by LavaCUBED.com or
shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally
identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving
the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through
"traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies",
"IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.
How do I correct or change Profile Information that I have give to LavaCUBED.com?
You may update this information at any time from within your LavaCUBED.com
account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar,
and then clicking on the "Personal" icon.
Is my Profile Information secure from others using the LavaCUBED.com
site?
Profile Information collected by LavaCUBED.com is stored in secure operating
environments that are not available to the public.
How else might someone learn of my Profile Information while visiting
another site?
In addition to directly providing information to LavaCUBED.com, you might
also provide Profile Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges
or bulletin board use made available to you on other sites, including other
Lava Network sites. Chat sessions and bulletin board or newsgroup use is
considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas.
The LavaCUBED.com Privacy Statement does not cover this type of transfer
of your Profile Information. You should always be careful when distributing
your Profile Information in this manner.
How is LavaCUBED.com registration information used in the LavaCUBED.com
Directory and how can I remove my name from the Directory?
For your privacy, LavaCUBED.com does not have any member directorythat
is available to the public. Copyright © Lava Network MCMXCIX and MM. All rights reserved. Terms of Service.

party.
9. NO SPAM; DAMAGES
Lava Network will immediately terminate any account which it believes,
in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any
spam or other unsolicited bulk e-mail. In addition, because damages are
often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated
then you agree to pay Lava Network liquidated damages of $5 for each piece
of spam or unsolicited bulk e-mail transmitted from or otherwise connected
with your account, otherwise you agree to pay Lava Network's actual damages,
to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
10. PARTICIPATION IN PROMOTIONS OF ADVERTISERS
Any dealings with Advertisers on the Service or participation in promotions,
including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any

third party. Lava Network shall not be responsible or liable for any part
of any such dealings or promotions.
11. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO CONTENT

music, sound, photographs, video, graphics or other material contained in
either sponsor advertisements or electronically distributed, commercially
produced information presented to you by the Service, by Lava Network, or

enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
