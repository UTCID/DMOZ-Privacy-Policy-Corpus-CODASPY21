TOM BIHN Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 25, 2018
This policy describes how we at TOM BIHN (collectively, "TOM BIHN," "we," or "us") collect, use and share information collected through the mail, TOM BIHN Factory Showroom, and tombihn.com.
How We Collect And Use Information
Account Information
We collect your personal information such as your name, your contact information, your shipping information, and your billing information (such as credit card account data) when you create an account on TOM BIHN. We use that information to provide TOM BIHN services (such as to process and ship your orders (“Orders”) or respond to customer service requests) and to analyze and improve TOM BIHN offerings.
Marketing
We collect your personal information when you sign up for our mailing list.  If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from TOM BIHN, then click “unsubscribe” button on those materials.
Usage and Device Information
We automatically collect certain device and usage information when you use TOM BIHN. For example, we collect information about the devices you use to connect to our services (such as the IP address of your computer or numeric identifier of your mobile device) and about how you use TOM BIHN (such as what time you visit our website).
Cookies
We may use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and other similar technologies to collect information in connection with the TOM BIHN website. A “cookie” is a computer file that acts as an identification card for your computer to distinguish your browser from others and enable us to serve you better. For example, we use cookies to save products in your shopping cart while you browse our websites and to track the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Similarly, a “web beacon” is a technology that can recognize specific cookies and convey information about that browser. We do not use these technologies to collect personal information.
Most browsers accept cookies automatically. You may be able to set your browser to reject and/or delete cookies. For instructions, check your browser’s technical information. However, if you reject or delete cookies then this may disable or interfere with features of the TOM BIHN website or other websites you visit. We recommend that you leave cookies “turned on” so we can offer you a better experience on our site.
Information You Post
All information that you share about yourself, whether personal information or not, in a public open forum – such as on our Forums or on a social network – will be considered public information for the purposes of this policy. If you don’t want it to be public, please don’t post it.
How We Share Information
Service Providers
We disclose your personal information to companies that provide services to us or perform functions on our behalf (such as processing credit card payments) and have agreed to use your information only for the purposes we request.
Compliance with Laws
We may disclose your personal information to a third party if (a) we believe that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) to protect the security or integrity of the website from harm or illegal activities; (c) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person; or (d) to any other third party with your prior written consent.
Business Transfers
We may share or transfer your personal information in connection with, or during the negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of the business to another company.
YOUR RIGHT TO CONTROL AND ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your Account
You have the option to update, correct or delete your personal information, by contacting us at privacy@tombihn.com  or give us a call at 1-800-729-9607.
Retention Policy
For marketing communications, you may Unsubscribe at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe button at the bottom of the page for such materials. For Orders, you may contact us at privacy@tombihn.com if you would like us to delete your information.
Do Not Track
Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. We do not respond to DNT signals.
EU Users
EU users have the right to lodge a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information by notifying their EU supervisory authority. Please feel free to contact us at privacy@tombihn.com as well.
Children
The online TOM BIHN services are not intended for the use of individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information online from individuals under the age of 13.
Links to Third Parties and Social Media
Our websites contain links to third-party online properties. Such third parties have their own policies that govern their collection, use, and disclosure of information. We suggest that you read their privacy policies to learn about their practices.
Social media provides tools that many people use and enjoy, and we include links to various social media platforms on our websites. If you interact with these social media tools through our websites, your experience on those social media sites will be governed by the privacy and other policies of those sites. The privacy settings you have chosen on those sites will determine the degree to which your information is made public. We encourage you to choose your privacy settings on those sites accordingly.
Safeguarding Your Personally Identifiable Information
We have reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative measures in place to safeguard the security of your personal information. However, when you communicate with us via email on our websites, these communications may not be encrypted. For that reason, we ask that you do not share sensitive information via these communication channels.
Updates to the Privacy Policy
If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy online. If the policy changes in a material way, we may contact you by email as well as by placing a prominent notice on this web page. You should check regularly to see if this Privacy Policy has changed.
