If you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, do not use or access the products or, when applicable, click the “cancel” button and do not purchase the products. If you have a signed, written agreement with CellarStone, such signed agreement will control to the extent there is any conflict between your signed agreement and this agreement.

Products. CellarStone will provide the products in accordance with this agreement. In order to use certain products, you may be required to download content, software, and/or required to agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in any such additional terms and conditions applicable to the specific products which you choose to use, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this agreement in relation to your use of that product. CellarStone may at its sole discretion, discontinue the products or modify the features of the products from time to time without prior notice. Use of the products requires one or more compatible devices, internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the products involves hardware, software, and internet access which are not supplied by CellarStone, your ability to use such products may be affected by the performance of these factors, over which CellarStone has no control. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility.
Responsibility for registration information and content of your communications. You may be required to provide information about yourself in order to register for and/or use certain products. You agree that any such information shall be accurate. You agree that you are solely responsible for the content (“content”) sent by you or displayed or uploaded by you in using the products. You agree that you will not use the products to send unsolicited commercial e-mail outside your company or organization in violation of applicable law. You further agree not to use the products to communicate any message or material that is harassing, libelous, threatening, obscene, indecent, would violate the privacy or intellectual property rights of any party or is otherwise unlawful, that would give rise to civil liability, or that constitutes or encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, under any applicable law or regulation. You further agree not to provide material support or resources (or to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources) to any organization(s) designated by the united states government as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the immigration and nationality act. You further agree not to upload or transmit any software, content or code that does or is intended to harm, disable, destroy or adversely affect performance of the products in any way or which does or is intended to harm or extract information or data from other hardware, software or networks of CellarStone or other users of products. Recognizing the global nature of the internet, you also agree to comply with applicable local rules or codes of conduct (including codes imposed by your employer) regarding online behavior and acceptable content and the transmission of technical data exported from the united states or the country in which you reside. CellarStone reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action against anyone who, in CellarStone’s sole discretion, is suspected of violating this provision, including without limitation, reporting you to law enforcement authorities. Use of the products is void where prohibited. Although CellarStone is not responsible for any content in violation of this provision, CellarStone may delete any such content of which CellarStone becomes aware, at any time without notice to you. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in content which you submit, post or display on or through, the products.

Responsibility for content of others. It is possible that other users of the products (“users”) may violate one or more of the above prohibitions. CellarStone assumes no responsibility or liability for such violation. If you become aware of any violation of this agreement in connection with use of the products by any person, please contact CellarStone at
CellarStone may investigate any complaints and violations that come to its attention and may take any action that it believes is appropriate, including, but not limited to issuing warnings, removing the content or terminating accounts and/or user profiles. However, because situations and interpretations vary, CellarStone also reserves the right not to take any action. Under no circumstances will CellarStone be liable in any way for any data or other content viewed while using the products, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any such data or content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, access to, or denial of access to any data or content. If at any time you are not happy with the products, your sole remedy is to cease using the products.

You agree that in the event CellarStone is unable to collect the fees owed to CellarStone for the products through your account, CellarStone may take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from you and that you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by CellarStone in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs and attorneys’ fees.
