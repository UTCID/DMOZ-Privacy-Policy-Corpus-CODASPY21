Software Piracy and Copyright Infringement
Computer software is protected by United States copyright laws (U.S. Code Titles 17 and 18). When purchasing software, you do not become the owner of the software or its copyright. Instead, you purchase a license to use the software solely as permitted by the software’s end user license agreement. If you copy, distribute or install the software in ways not permitted by the license agreement (regardless of whether you are doing so for sale, free distribution, or personal use), you are committing copyright infringement and breaking the law. Such actions potentially expose you to serious civil liabilities and/or criminal prosecution.
If you commit copyright infringement or place any type of stop payment, the copyright owner may file a lawsuit to stop you from using the software and can also request monetary damages.
Monetary damages may include statutory damages, which can be as much as $150,000 for each program copied. The government can also criminally prosecute you for copyright infringement. If convicted, you can be fined up to $250,000 and/or sentenced to jail for up to five (5) years.
