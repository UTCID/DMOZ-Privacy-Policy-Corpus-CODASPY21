Privacy Policy
Privacy Policyadmin2020-02-20T14:56:52+00:00
Effective January 1, 2020.
Your privacy is important to Mi9 Retail, Inc. and our subsidiaries and affiliates (“Mi9 Retail,” “Publisher,” “us,” “our,” or “we”).  We respect your preferences concerning the treatment of any Personal Information that we may collect. This policy explains how we collect and use your Personal Information, how you can control its use, and it describes our practices regarding information collected from Mi9 Retail sites that link or refer to this policy (such as our websites, software applications, social media pages, and HTML-formatted e-mail messages), as well as through offline sales and marketing activities (collectively, the “Content”). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Mi9 Retail respects the rights and data protection of personal Users (hereinafter, the “User,” “you,” or “your”) of this website, mi9retail.com (hereinafter, the “Site”), and associated software applications. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how:
A User’s Personal Information, as well as information relating to a User’s navigation, are collected, processed, and used; and
The User can control how his or her information is used.
The head of the collection of Personal Information is Mi9 Retail, 12000 Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 600, Miami, FL  33181.
Use of the Site and software applications associated with the Site (collectively, the “Services”) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Policy.
What Information We Collect
Through your interaction with and use of the Content, Mi9 Retail may collect personal information, which is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. Personal information allows identification directly or indirectly (e.g., by cross-checking information) of the User as a physical person. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to:
your name
physical address
telephone number
e-mail address
company affiliation
associated interests
(“Personal Information”)
Mi9 Retail may also collect other information through your interaction with and use of the Content, which does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual (“Other Information”). Other Information may include, but is not limited to:
data collected through automated electronic interactions
navigation on the Site
browser and device information
application usage data
demographic information
geographic or geo-location information
data that the Publisher collects when a User uses the Services or the pages of social networks that are related to the Site
and statistical and aggregated information
Public data, namely the data made public by the User on a social network account linked to their account for the Services, may also be identified.
Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from Personal Information. We may also combine Other Information with Personal Information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. Likewise, information regarding navigation does not reveal the identity of the User, but it allows the Publisher to learn more about the User’s behavior regarding the use of the Services (e.g., geolocation, links that the User clicked on the Site, etc.). This, too, when associated with the collection of Personal Information, is treated as Personal Information.
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Mi9 Retail complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Mi9 Retail has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  The certification can be found at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Mi9 Retail sometimes provides personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the personal data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Mi9 Retail commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should contact us at info@mi9retail.com. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means.
Mi9 Retail has further committed to cooperating with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU.  EU Persons may have the option to select binding arbitration under the Privacy Shield Panel for the resolution of your complaint under certain circumstances. For further information, please see the Privacy Shield website. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework at https://www.privacyshield.gov.

How We Collect Information
Mi9 Retail and our third party service providers may collect both Personal Information and Other Information from a variety of sources that generally fall into three categories:
Publicly Available Data/Data from Third Parties:
data that you may have made publicly available, such as from personal social networks
data from partners in accordance with the contractual terms binding the publishers of those sites
data provided by third-party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators
Direct Interactions: Data obtained from your use of and/or interaction with us through the Content and other activities, such as:
account creation
submission of registrations and forms
sales inquiries and transactions
Automated Interactions: Personal Information and data can be obtained through the use of technology, including:
electronic communication protocols
cookies
embedded URLs or pixels
or widgets, buttons, and tools
Although Mi9 Retail’s use of automated interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about Mi9 Retail’s current approach to information collected from automated interactions.
Electronic Communications Protocols: Mi9 Retail may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection, which often consists of network routing information, equipment information, your IP address, time, and date. Mi9 Retail may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the Content, such as clickstream information or general geo-location data.
Cookies: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device during the use of the Services. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but, to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. The cookie, during its use, allows Mi9 Retail to recognize the relevant device at each use of the Services. After the device accesses digital content via the cookies, we can collect additional anonymous information about the behavior, and ultimately, the preferences of the User of the Services, which can allow us to tailor the websites to your interests.
The implementation of cookies on your device(s) is known and accepted from the time when you browse the Site or click on “OK” if a cookie banner exists. Current versions of web browsers offer enhanced user controls regarding the placement and duration of both first- and third-party cookies. Search for “cookies” under your web browser’s Help menu for more information on the cookie management features available to you. These choices can be modified at any time.
Mi9 Retail electronic Content utilizes cookies, including the use of web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) are being accessed. Some Mi9 Retail websites will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. We use multiple third parties to monitor web traffic, statistics, advertisement click-through, and other activities on Mi9 Retail’s Content. Where authorized by us, such third parties may use cookies, our web log files, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to evaluate use of our website. The refusal or the deletion of cookies by you is likely to limit some features of the Site, and implies the renunciation by you of some benefits of the Services, as well as commercial information that could be provided through the Services. Where appropriate, Mi9 Retail declines all responsibility for the consequences related to the operation degradation of the Services that result from the refusal of the implementation of cookies by the User.
Embedded URLs: Mi9 Retail may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the electronic Content without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Content, but they are not associated with Personal Information and are not used beyond the session.
Embedded Pixels and Similar Technologies: On the electronic Content, Mi9 Retail and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies for the purposes of identifying unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits), and for advertising purposes. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when an e-mail or ad was opened, in order to track marketing campaign responsiveness. Information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient’s e-mail address.
Widgets, Buttons, and Tools: Our electronic Content may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our Site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies’ services (e.g., a “Like” button or third-party map). The widget, button, or tool may collect and automatically send Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, or Other Information, such as your browser information or IP address, to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons, or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button, or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
Physical Location: We may collect the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.
Retention
Mi9 Retail retains your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, as well as to comply with applicable laws. Your consent to such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of our relationship with you. Personal User data is deleted when retention periods expire.
Nevertheless, the personal User data will be archived beyond the durations provided, for the purposes of research or for the finding and prosecution of criminal offenses, for the sole purpose of allowing, as needed, the provision of such data to the appropriate authorities. Archiving implies that the personal User data will not be searchable in line, but will be anonymized and kept on an autonomous and secure support.
Information collected through cookies are preserved for a maximum of 13 months from the first deposit in the equipment of the User’s device, following the acceptance of the User.
