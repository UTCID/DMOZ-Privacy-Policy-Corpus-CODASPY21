What we're thinking about?
The AI-Powered Enterprise
As big data and big compute become more available and more efficient to access, we expect to see a wave of new startups using machine learning technology to optimize the enterprise. From fine-tuning marketing spend to predicting accounts receivables, all aspects of the enterprise will be impacted.
Adaptive Cybersecurity
Cyberattack threats are now a top concern for all enterprises. Malicious actors are increasingly sophisticated and vulnerabilities in new media and the Internet of Things are opening the door to additional attack vectors for these cybercriminals. The need for advanced security technology is more important than ever.
Disruptive Vertical SaaS
The advantages of the Software-as- a-Service model aren't limited to the traditional large enterprise. Mid-market companies and niche industries recognize that they must become more agile and adopt new technologies in order to stay competitive. We're excited by startups building software for hidden markets.
The Industrial "Edge" Stack
The increasing demand for connected hardware and real-time processing at the edge of the network (ie. IoT devices, drones, autonomous vehicles) is feeding into a need for computing power at the edge alongside the datacenter. We are interested in infrastructure bets needed to support this.
B2B Marketplaces
Digital marketplaces are changing traditional business sectors, opening new markets and growth opportunities to manufacturers, distributors, and service providers. In many cases, transactions are becoming more efficient through dynamic pricing and purchase automation.
Frontier Technology
While others were investing in hardware, we’re excited about software. Software that accelerates neural networks and quantum computing capabilities is at the core of enterprise transformation.
