Privacy Policy
OmniUpdate is deeply committed to user privacy and to the security of all data in
our possession. The following privacy policy is meant to help you understand what
information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, and delete
your information.
Information Collection
Personal information collection when you visit our websites, use OU Campus, and/or
use OmniUpdate developed products
Personal information refers to any information that you voluntarily submit to us that
identifies you personally, including contact information such as your name, email
address, phone number, company name, address, and any other information about your
business or yourself. Personal information can also include information about you
that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google,
or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers.
OmniUpdate.com, OU Campus, and OmniUpdate developed products utilize Google Analytics
and other tools to track and analyze internet visitor usage data, which may include
your IP address, geographical location, browser type, domain name(s), internet service
provider (ISP), the pages and files viewed on our site, operating system, length of
visit, access times, referring website addresses, and web browser cookies. We also
may utilize third parties to target advertisements to visitor interest categories.
This information is used by OmniUpdate to operate and improve our website, products,
and services; to personalize information; and to provide general statistics regarding
use and user behavior so that we can continually improve them. In some cases, we do
link this automatically-collected data to personal information voluntarily submitted
such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
If credit card information is collected to secure payment for services, such information
is not stored by OmniUpdate. Our bank assists in the processing of credit card transactions
and all card information is destroyed after the transaction is successfully completed.
Payments made via check are processed through private bank means and all checking
information is maintained securely in our office and with our bank. Billing information
is never used by OmniUpdate for marketing or promotional purposes.
Cookies
We use cookies when you visit our websites, use OU Campus, and/or use other OmniUpdate
developed products to help us provide you with a good browsing and user experience
and it also allows us to improve our site, products, and services. By continuing to
browse the site, use OU Campus, and/or use other OmniUpdate developed products, you
are agreeing to our use of cookies.
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the
hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your
computer’s hard drive.
We use the following cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include,
for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website or make
use of our products and services.
Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors
move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our
website works, for example, by ensuring that users find what they are looking for
easily.
Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to
personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences
(for example, your choice of language or region).
Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited, and the
links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the
advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this
information with third parties for this purpose.
You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes
for which we use them below.
Third-party cookies
Our websites, products, and services will set several types of third-party cookies,
and we do not control the operation of any of them. The third-party cookies that may
be set include:
Google Analytics – We use Google Analytics to collect data about website usage. This
data does not include personally identifiable information. View the Google Privacy Policy.
Google Remarketing – We use Google’s Remarketing cookie to market products and services
we think may be of interest to you. You may see our adverts on Google’s Display Advertising
Network of partner websites and Google’s own search results pages. We aim to carefully
select the products and services we remarket to you and do so based on the pages you
have visited on our website. To opt out of Google Remarketing, set your Google Ad Settings.
Zendesk, Inc. – This license cookie enables our installation of Zendesk, making it
possible for visitors to use the support chat functionality on our support site. It
does not collect any personally identifiable information. Read the Zendesk Privacy Policy.
LiveChat, Inc. – This license cookie enables our installation of LiveChat, making
it possible for visitors to use the LiveChat functionality on this site. It does not
automatically collect any personally identifiable information. Read the LiveChat Privacy Policy.
Salesforce Pardot – Pardot tracks visitor and prospect activities on our website and
landing pages. Pardot cookies don’t store personally identifying information, only
a unique identifier. Read the Salesforce Pardot Privacy Policy.

of cookies to market products and services that may be of interest to you. Read the
Triblio Privacy Policy.
FullStory – OmniUpdate uses FullStory to track and understand user behavior within
beta and demo environments in service to improving the customer experience. OmniUpdate
employees engaged in the design and development of OU Campus can see a rendering of
the path the user has taken through the product. FullStory captures your OU Campus
user name, full name, gravitar image, IP address, and IP-based geolocation. Where
possible, OmniUpdate uses functionality that will blur user data so that employees
cannot see it as they watch the FullStory reproductions of the user’s experience.
However, the messaging and notifications feature does not support blurring of data,
so it is advised that users refrain from including sensitive or personally identifiable
data within the subject or body of the messages. Read the FullStory Privacy Policy.
Typeform - OmniUpdate uses a forms tool provided by Typeform to survey our customers for feedback
related to improving our products and services. We will never ask for personal information
not directly related to the topic on which we’re soliciting feedback, but we often
ask for the customer’s name and school affiliation. Additionally, we receive the user’s
IP address in the response to the surveys.  Read the Typeform Privacy and Cookie Policies.
UserVoice - OmniUpdate uses services provided by UserVoice to support our support
chat capabilities. To learn more about the data that UserVoice collects and how they
use it, read the UserVoice Privacy Policy.

Community Network discussion forum that enables our customers to suggest enhancements
to OU Campus, vote on the suggestions, and get support from OmniUpdate and peers. To
learn more about the data that SocialEngine collects and how they use it, read the
SocialEngine Privacy Policy.

refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings
to block all cookies you may not be able to access all or parts of our sites.

on training sessions and support materials. Information provided in these surveys
is used to improve our training curriculum and support materials. These surveys may
ask you for personal information; you can choose whether or not to volunteer that
information.
Retention of personal information
How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information,
as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize
your information or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your information
and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
We retain personal information that you provide to us where we have an ongoing legitimate
business need to do so (for example, as long as is required in order to contact you
about our products or services, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations,
resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
we securely delete the information or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, we
will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible. We will delete this information from the servers at an
earlier date if you so request, as described in the Opt-Out section below.

about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you
last expressed interest in our content, products, or services, such as when you last
opened an email from us or ceased using your OmniUpdate account. We retain information
derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time
from the date such information was created.
Information Sharing
Service providers
We employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our websites,
our customers, and users of our products and/or services and may need to share your
information with them to provide information, products, or services to you. Examples
may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or
performing statistical analysis, providing marketing assistance, processing credit
card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you
with better service, and providing customer service or support. In all cases where
we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge
and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.
OmniUpdate partners
In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your
request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide
customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information
except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of
your information.

we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners,
we will tell you who we are sharing data with and provide a link to the co-marketing

The OmniUpdate network has extensive protective measures in place to ensure that misuse,
loss, corruption, and alteration of data does not happen. To ensure the continued
security of your individualized information, OmniUpdate conducts periodic reviews
of our security infrastructure, regularly updating our practices to meet the highest
technological and data protection industry standards. We protect unauthorized access
and inappropriate use of sensitive data at both the hardware and software levels,

and VPN technologies for data in transit and encryption for data storage. Our products
also incorporate advanced security features and methods, including encoded session
identifications and dynamic data. The OmniUpdate team is also committed to internal
policies that dictate exactly how employees may use and access secure data.
OmniUpdate does not share, distribute, print, or reference any individualized information
except as may be required by law. We will only view or access individual information
with specific permission as needed to implement products and services or to resolve
a support issue. However, users may elect to share such information with a third-party
vendor to perform certain specific services deemed reputable and secure by OmniUpdate
management. Please note that each user is responsible for maintaining the security
of their own email accounts and OU Campus user credentials, including passwords.
