Virtual CISO Service
Home / Cybersecurity Services / Virtual CISO Service: Chief Security and Privacy Officer on Demand
Who Is Looking at Your Cybersecurity Big Picture?
Cyber risk is a complex business issue, not simply an IT issue.  Small & mid-sized businesses with immature cyber risk management programs tend to sweep cyber risk under the proverbial rug, hoping that somebody is taking care of it. Many trust their managed services provider or in-house IT staff to handle the technical side of security. Unfortunately, managing cybersecurity requires specialized skills and experience outside their typical scope of work.Bringing on a full-time CISO is very expensive and recruitment is highly competitive in today’s job market due to the nation’s huge cybersecurity talent shortage.  To add insult to injury, most companies don’t even need a FULL-time CISO.  So, how are modern day organizations getting their cybersecurity needs met?  That’s where a virtual CISO comes in.With TCDI’s virtual CISO service, you’ll gain access to a team of certified and highly skilled cybersecurity experts on an “as-needed” basis for a fraction of the cost of a full-time resource. Security is vital for every organization, but not every organization can afford to recruit, hire, and retain a cybersecurity expert. Our team is available “on-demand” to serve as trusted advisors who can fulfill your organization’s data security needs.We’ve made it our objective to work with clients to mature their cybersecurity programs with our knowledgeable experts who work hard and truly care about protecting people’s information.
Benefits of a vCISOVirtual CISO Service Gives You Peace of MindA virtual CISO, or vCISO, is the solution for organizations that do not need a full-time Chief Information Security Officer on the leadership team. Part of a managed services model for data security, the vCISO is a team of certified and highly skilled experts available to provide cybersecurity services to your organization on a part-time basis. There are several benefits of a vCISO service, including:Lower cost than a full-time CISOInformed leadership teamResource readily available, on-demandAccess to sophisticated tools and specialized knowledgeAbility to work at your office or remotelyKnowledge of the latest threats, laws, and guidelinesObjective 3rd party adviceCompliance with regulatory obligationsCustomized data security metricsData security peace of mindA vCISO can provide all the services of a traditional Chief Information Security Officer, including:Cybersecurity AssessmentPenetration TestingIntrusion Detection/PreventionSecurity StrategyPolicy Review and DevelopmentEmployee TrainingBusiness Continuity PlanningData Loss PreventionAlthough everyone in an organization has at least some level of responsibility for data security, it is crucial to have someone in charge of and responsible for data security at your organization. Someone who knows the plan and how to implement it. This person should steward a secure information culture embedded in the organization’s strategy, with a focus on continuous improvement.Hiring a full-time employee for this role, however, sometimes does not make sense because full-time Chief Information Security Officers can be expensive and difficult to recruit and retain. A vCISO does the same job as a traditional CISO but, with one difference, the vCISO is a part-time resource with a full-time benefit. As a result, you can secure your organization for a fraction of the cost. And you can sleep better at night because of it.
