Privacy & Compliance Services
HomeServicesPrivacy & Compliance Services
As cybersecurity advisors, it’s imperative we separate privacy (individual data collection, permissible use, sharing of data, retention of information) from security (access control & data protection).
Herjavec Group’s Advisory Services team keeps these definitions top of mind as we review your organization’s security infrastructure against three principles to understand the existing information technology control framework, identifying where you are most vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks. As the cornerstone of our Advisory Services practice, our Privacy Consulting Team partners with you to prioritize applicable legislative requirements and industry directives when performing our advisory evaluations.
