Privacy Policy
WE DON'T SELL YOUR INFORMATION TO ANYONE!
Protecting personal information is a top priority at onlinespamsolutions.com and we have made every effort to provide you piece of mind while submitting private information on our website.
Online SecurityOnlinespamsolutions.com uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) whenever sensitive information is sent or received from your computer. This assures that nobody else can see or alter any personal information in transit.
SSL server authentication allows the browser to confirm a server's identity. Using standard techniques of public-key cryptography, it checks that the server's certificate and public ID are valid and have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) listed in the browser's list of trusted CAs.
An SSL connection encrypts all information sent between the browser and our server. This provides an extremely high degree of confidentiality. In addition, all data sent over an encrypted SSL connection is protected with a mechanism for detecting tampering--that is, for automatically determining whether the data has been altered in transit.
Information CollectionOnlinespamsolutions.com will collect nonpublic personal information about you which is necessary to process your application for service or other requests. The term "nonpublic personal information" refers to information about you which we receive from the sources described below and which is not otherwise lawfully available to the general public.
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from (1) information we receive from you on any service subscription form or any other forms, (2) information we receive when verifying what you have provided on a service subscription form or any other form.
