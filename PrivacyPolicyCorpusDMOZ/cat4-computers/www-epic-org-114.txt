DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Preservation of Biological Evidence Under 18 U.S.C. § 3600A
Docket No. OAG 109
A.G. Order No. 2762-2005
Interim Rule With Request For Comments
COMMENTS OF THE ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER
In an April 28, 2005 Federal Register notice, the Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) published an interim rule to implement 18 U.S.C. § 3600A,
which requires the government to preserve biological evidence collected
during the investigation or prosecution of a federal crime for which
an individual has been imprisoned.1
Pursuant to the notice, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”)
submits these comments to urge the DOJ to define how existing privacy
obligations affect the implementation of the Innocence Protection Act
and to prohibit the use of material stored under 18 U.S.C. § 3600A
(hereinafter “section 3600A”) outside the recognized purpose
of the statute.
The Innocence Protection Act (“IPA”) was enacted in 2004
to provide new avenues of post-conviction relief for defendants found
guilty of crimes they did not commit.2 The
IPA ensures that “persons convicted and imprisoned for Federal offenses
may seek DNA testing” of biological evidence collected in the crimes
for which they were convicted and in which they profess their innocence.
3 It
also requires the government to preserve collected biological evidence to make
possible future post-conviction testing.4 The
IPA was approved as part of the Justice for All Act, which also provided funds
to allow approved agencies to test evidence to identify perpetrators of unsolved
crimes.5
EPIC applauds the efforts of Congress and the DOJ to enable
post-conviction testing to ensure that people do not continue to serve time for crimes they
did not commit. As the IPA’s name and legislative history suggest, the
purpose of section 3600A is to protect the innocent. To further this purpose,
EPIC urges the DOJ to adopt language that recognizes the privacy implications
of storing biological evidence and ensures that access to this evidence is
limited to those who are authorized to analyze it under 18 U.S.C. § 3600
and 42 U.S.C. § 14135 (2005). I.
The DOJ Should Clarify the Privacy Obligations That
Exist In Storing Biological Evidence Under 18 U.S.C. § 3600A.
Pursuant to section 3600A, the government must preserve all
biological evidence
that is secured during the investigation or prosecution of a federal offense
while a defendant remains imprisoned for that offense.6 As
the DOJ recognized in its Interim Rule, “[t]he general purpose of section
3600A is to preserve biological evidence for possible DNA testing under section
3600.”7
Furthermore,
the DOJ links its definition of biological evidence that must be
preserved under
section 3600A to “the legislative purpose underlying the enactment
of section
3600A —
i.e., preserving biological evidence for the purpose of
possible DNA testing
under 18 U.S.C. 3600.”8 However,
neither the statute nor the Interim Rule limits access of the stored evidence
to uses that further this explicit legislative purpose. Furthermore, neither
the statute nor the Interim Rule recognizes the privacy implications
of maintaining
a collection of biological material, which may contain DNA not only from the
perpetrator of the crime, but also from victims and third parties. The material stored under section 3600A is collected pursuant to
the investigation
of a crime. This material may include DNA samples from suspects, victims, and
anyone else relevant to the investigation. Its collection is subject
to the privacy
protections of both state and federal law.9 These
protections include the Constitutional right against unreasonable search and
seizure, as well as statutory protections governing the general collection and
storage of criminal evidence and the specific protections provided
for biological
material.10
The storage
of the material should therefore be subject to those same protections.
In fact, Congress has already recognized that stored biological
material is subject
to privacy protections. In the same Act that created the obligation to store
material under section 3600A, Congress created the National Forensic Science
Commission (hereinafter “the Commission”).11 The
Commission is tasked with examining all federal, state, and local
privacy protections
governing DNA samples and DNA analysis. Furthermore, it is charged
with the responsibility
of determining whether such protections are sufficient and to make
specific recommendations
to enhance the privacy protections of DNA information.12 Because of the serious privacy implications of storing genetic
material, EPIC
urges the DOJ to formally recognize that the material stored under
section 3600A
is subject to state and federal privacy protections from the time it
is collected.
In addition, EPIC urges the DOJ to work with the National Forensic
Science Commission
to help identify and enforce the privacy protections applicable to
section 3600A.
II.
The DOJ Should Restrict Access To and Use of Biological Material
Stored Under Section 3600A To the Purpose Specified By Congress.
DNA is useful for a variety of applications not contemplated by
sections 3600
or 3600A. While biological material is preserved under section 3600A
specifically
to exonerate an individual convicted of a crime, this material could also be
used for other purposes. According to the Human Genome Project, coordinated by
the Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health to map and study the
entire human genetic sequence: DNA can provide insights into many intimate aspects of a
person and their families
including susceptibility to particular diseases, legitimacy of birth,
and perhaps
predispositions to certain behaviors and sexual orientation. This increases the
potential for genetic discrimination by government, insurers,
employers, schools,
banks, and others.13
Recently, the Senate specifically noted that genetic material can be tested for
advanced detection of genetic diseases or used as a basis to deny
medical insurance.14
None of these uses advances the legislative purpose behind section
3600A, yet
the Interim Rule interpreting the section does not explicitly prohibit any of
them. The rule allows individual agencies that collect biological evidence to
transfer the material to any other agency.15 It
places no limits on the purposes for transferring material, instead leaving all
decisions to the discretion of individual agencies.16 There is an established legislative history in favor of limiting
access to DNA
information to those government agencies whose use of the information advances
the purpose of its collection. When Congress authorized the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to create the Combined DNA Index System (“CODIS”), it
limited disclosure of the stored DNA samples and DNA analyses collected under
the program.17 Criminal
justice agencies are allowed to access information only for law
enforcement identification
purposes.18
A defendant
in federal or state court can access information, but she has access only to
the samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which she is
charged.19
No unauthorized
use of the material or collected information is permitted, because
specific provisions
of the statute limit access to the material.20 Other sections of the Justice for All Act also have explicit
privacy provisions
limiting access to biological material. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog
Grant Program,
42 U.S.C. § 14135, will only provide grants to analyze biological material
from crime scenes if the applicant certifies that each DNA analysis carried out
under the plan adheres to the privacy requirements applicable to
CODIS.21
Furthermore,
the program is subject to privacy protection standards requiring any
sample collected
or analysis performed under the DNA Backlog Grant Program to be used only for
specific criminal investigative purposes specified by the
program.22 A
person who knowingly violates this privacy protection standard is subject to
a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to one year.23 In order to continue Congress’ established trend toward
limiting the use
of DNA information to narrowly defined purposes, EPIC urges the DOJ to adopt
language to limit access to and restrict use of the material stored
under section
3600A. As the DOJ has already recognized, “[t]he general purpose
of section
3600A is to preserve biological evidence for possible DNA testing under section
3600.”24 Thus,
access to the material stored under section 3600A should be narrowly limited
to DNA testing contemplated by section 3600. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program highlights the only
other legitimate
government use of stored biological material: “to ensure that
the true offender
is caught and convicted for the crime.”25 By
analyzing the large backlog of DNA evidence collected in crime investigations,
thousands of cases may be solved. This legitimate use, however, does not apply
to the majority of material stored under section 3600A. Biological
material will
only be stored pursuant to section 3600A when a person has already
been convicted
of the crime in which the material was collected.26 There
is no reason for the government to analyze the stored biological material to
solve an additional crime; the only reason to analyze the material is to ensure
that the true offender is caught and convicted. While it is true that
“[c]rime
scene evidence can also be linked to other crime scenes” in order to solve
cases, the link between crime scenes is the perpetrator’s
DNA.27 The
government already has the authority to index the DNA profile of anyone convicted
of a crime.28 If there
is no DNA profile in CODIS for any person currently in custody, the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons is authorized to collect a DNA sample for
analysis.29
Therefore,
there is no need to access stored biological material in order to create a DNA
profile. Once a person is convicted, the only reason to access stored
biological
material is if there is doubt as to the true perpetrator of the crime. Because of the clear intent of the Justice for All Act, there is
only one legitimate
reason for the government to access material stored under section
3600A: to determine
if the person originally convicted of the crime is in fact guilty. EPIC urges
the DOJ to adopt regulations limiting access to material stored under section
3600A to criminal justice agencies for this clearly specified purpose.
Conclusion
In light of the privacy concerns implicit in the retention of biological material and the limited reasons for accessing biological material stored under section 3600A, we recommend the following:
The DOJ, in conjunction with the National Forensic Science Commission, should identify the existing privacy protections concerning the storage or use of biological material.
The DOJ should formally recognize the existence of such privacy protections and mandate that all agencies which preserve biological material under section 3600A follow these protections. In order to do this, EPIC recommends the following change to the interim rules:
Strike “.” at the end of 28 C.F.R. § 28.22(c) (interim), “Conditions of Preservation,” and add “, provided that existing privacy protections concerning the storage or use of biological material are maintained.”
The DOJ should continue the long tradition of limiting access to biological material to those who have legitimate purposes to access the material. In order to do this, EPIC recommends the following change to the interim rules:
After 28 C.F.R. § 28.22(c), as modified above, add the following:
(d) Use of Stored Biological Material. The requirement of section 3600A to preserve biological material was enacted by Congress in order to ensure the ability of future testing under 18 U.S.C. § 3600. Congress has repeatedly limited the use of biological material collected in criminal investigations through privacy protection standards. In light of the existing privacy protection standards maintained by Congress and its reasons for enacting section 3600A, access to biological material that is subject to the preservation requirement of section 3600A is limited to Federal criminal justice agencies only for the following purposes:
To perform DNA testing requested under the provisions of 18 USC § 3600,
To perform DNA testing in order to determine if an individual convicted of any Federal or State offense is actually innocent of the offense, and
To perform DNA testing pursuant to an investigation of additional perpetrators of the crime in which the biological material was collected, if additional evidence suggests the existence of such persons.
The DOJ must recognize the privacy implications inherent in
storing biological
material and ensuring that agencies follow the existing privacy
protections that
govern material stored under section 3600A. As Congress stated,
“DNA testing
has the capacity not only to identify the perpetrators of crimes but also to
exonerate the innocent.”30 The
DOJ should limit access to material preserved under section 3600A to government
agencies that will use the material to further the legislative purpose of the
section, as suggested above. Respectfully submitted, Marcia Hofmann

Federal law authorizes
the collection of DNA identification records in the Combined DNA
Index System
(“CODIS”) only of persons charged with or convicted of a crime.
DNA identification records from persons who voluntarily submit samples for
elimination purposes are not allowed to be included in CODIS. 42
U.S.C. § 14132(a)(1).
Three states allow under certain circumstances the collection of
DNA identification
records of persons who have been arrested, but not charged, with a crime.
Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 411.1471(a)(2) (2004); La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. § 15:609(A)(1)
(2005); Va. Code Ann. § 19.2-310.2:1 (2004). This information is not
included in the federal database. 18 U.S.C. § 14132(a)(1)(C).
10
These
protections include
the provisions governing DNA samples and analysis, infra note 20,
as well as provisions governing the use of information taken from
the biological
material. For example, Washington State recognizes that genetic material
is the same as any health information that is covered under the
state’s
health privacy law. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 70.02.010(6)
(2005). Furthermore,
Congress is currently considering a bill that would outlaw the
use of genetic
information to discriminate in employment or health insurance
coverage. Genetic
