privacy is one of our primary concerns. This Privacy Policy describes
the guidelines Morovia uses to protect the information we collect about
you during your visit to our Web site.Information we collectAt various times, Morovia requests personal information. This can be done
while you are visiting the site, or during a purchase via our Web site,
phone, or fax. Information we collect may include your name, address,
telephone number, email address, credit card information, and personal
interests. In addition, Morovia periodically sponsors contests and other
promotions that may require additional information in order to participate.What we do with this informationThe requests for information allow Morovia to provide services you have
requested or to enhance your experience while visiting us. The information
that we collect during a purchase is necessary for us to fulfill your
order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer
service possible. Morovia will not sell your private information to any
outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. However, many
downloadable software applications that we sell require the software
developers to provide the customer with a registration code to convert
trial versions into full versions. In these cases, Morovia must provide the
software developers with relevant customer information in order for them to
generate a registration code and email it to the customer. Although we
strongly encourage software developers to follow strict privacy policies,
Morovia cannot be responsible for the privacy practices that each of the
software companies follow. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of
a certain developer or software company, you may contact them directly or
visit their individual Web sites. Morovia may also disclose your
information in certain cases where we have your permission or under special
circumstances, such as when we believe it is required by law. Periodically,
we will use the information provided to us to notify you of important
announcements regarding special offers or important functionality changes
to our Web site. Morovia also provides free email newsletters to those who
are interested in receiving them. If you would rather not receive these
updates and/or newsletters, you can request to be excluded from these
announcements in your user profile at Morovia or during checkout. We also
include unsubscribe instructions with each email newsletter we send out.
Morovia may also use customer information on an aggregate basis to better
understand our users and to improve our services. Aggregate statistics may
also be disclosed to potential advertisers and/or business partners. (For
example, we might use the aggregate statistic “15% of Morovia's users are
from Texas, the United States”, but we would not give away that
“Mr. John Doe, age 35, is from
Dallas, Texas, U.S.A.”, unless we had prior permission.)The Use of cookieMorovia does use cookies. Cookies are small information files stored by
your browser on your hard drive that allow us to provide advanced features

settings to disable cookies, but please note that cookies must be enabled
on your browser in order to make a purchase at our Web site.Your ConsentBy visiting and purchasing products through Morovia's Web site, you
