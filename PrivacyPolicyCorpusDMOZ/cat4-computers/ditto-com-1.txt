We may now or in the future contract with other companies to provide certain services to us, such as suppliers, payment processors and technology service providers, and we may need to give them access to information, such as your email address, in order for them to perform services for us. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any rights to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. In addition, we may at times share aggregated and anonymized Site statistics with our partners and service providers so that we and they can understand how and how often people use our Site. We will never disclose Site statistics in a manner that would allow a third party to identify you individually without your express consent. If we or our assets were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy. We do not currently have a parent company or any affiliates, but in the future we may and may share your information with them, but they will be subject to the same obligations set out in this policy.  We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iii) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.  How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information?  We retain your biometric information submitted to Ditto from the U.S. to the Site for a maximum of three years following collection. We retain your other personal data: (A) for as long as reasonably necessary to provide you with access to the Site; (B) as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed; and (C) as otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation, We retain some of your information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that it could be used to identify you. Security of InformationWe store all of our information, including your personal information, using industry-standard techniques.
