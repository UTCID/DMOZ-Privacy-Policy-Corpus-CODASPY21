The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the foregoing with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
You further agree that any disputes or claims not subject to the arbitration provision discussed above shall be resolved by a court located in the State of Texas, Dallas County and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action. PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE: (1) WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST US BASED ON THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, DALLAS COUNTY FOR ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THIS PROVISION; AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, DALLAS COUNTY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR CLAIMS.
Modification
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Your continued use of the Platform after any such modifications have been made shall be deemed to be your conclusive acceptance of any modified version of the Terms. We will indicate that changes to the Terms have been made by updating the date indicated after “Last Updated” at the beginning or end of these Terms. If you do not agree to abide by the initial version and any modified version of the Terms, then you are not authorized to use the Platform.
