Data Privacy Is Confusing, And It Will Stay That Way For A While

In the modern world, it’s easy to understand that data is absolutely essential to many corporations and organizations. There is an ever-growing need to understand the needs and desires of your customer base, so that you may tailor your products/services/platform as much as possible to meet these particular needs. However, we also are coming to a point where human beings are beginning to realize that the way that their data is being used can be quite harmful. One of the most obvious examples is the [Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html), in which data from Facebook’s user base was used to influence a …

I think MS is getting a bit shifty in how it coerces you to have an MS account. It's finding more and more ways to get you on the inside. One example of many...Diagnostics collected about your device and how you use it. By default,this diagnostics collecting is turned on. When you discover this, information has already been collected about you. You opt to turn off this collecting. MS tells you that you can view the collected data by turning on the Diagnostics Data Viewer. When you click on this option, you are told you will need a new app …

I'm sure the forum experts can give some very good feedback in response to this question. Due to the fact I'm beginning to feel somewhat paranoid over my privacy concerns, I'd like to hear from others as well. I need some assurance that I haven't gone off the deep end. I've noticed in the past, and yet again today, that many of the privacy settings for Win 10 that I had turned off are on again. This happens with every new update. My question: Does that mean Microsoft is not to be trusted? (I don't expect many to stick their …

I take security and privacy issues seriously, but sometimes I despair when news stories such as that regarding Samsung TVs eavesdropping on private conversation explode across the media as happened last week. The reason for my despondency has less to do with the data privacy debate and more to do with the human stupidity one. That said, let's get the technical bit out of the way first. The privacy scare story kicked off after someone, eventually, noticed that privacy policy relating to Samsung smart TVs included the line: "Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other …

I was just roaming the internet for some interesting reads and I came across [this very interesting paper](http://www.priv.gc.ca/information/research-recherche/2011/forcese_201107_e.asp) about how to define a legal framework for the "reasonable expectation of privacy" when it comes to our new cyber-existence. I thought I'd share it with you guys, and see what you think about agencies being able and allowed to collect and analyse huge amounts of data about any individual they like. The main point of the article is that the conventional wisdom that says that when you roam outside, in public places, you can't expect privacy (i.e., people (incl. authorities) could …

How much anonymity does a VPN really provide?

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network to be formal, is a method of creating an encrypted data tunnel across the Internet from your device to a destination server. Although savvy home users and enterprises will operate their own VPNs (business-grade routers provide this functionality) for most folk, a VPN comes by way of a dedicated service provider. In theory, and as far as many of those VPN users are concerned, this provides them with both security and secrecy. People think that a VPN keeps them anonymous while online. People are more often than not wrong. What a VPN, any VPN, …

How is it that the government that tells us that they need a back door into encryption because the tool that we use to safeguard our privacy can also be used by "bad guys" for evil purposes, completely forgets this argument when it comes to guns? "Yeah, bad guys use guns for bad things but there's nothing we can do." The right to bear arms (interpretation up to debate) and the right to privacy are both supposedly guaranteed in the constitution (amendments 2 and 4).

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has released the latest version of its 'Who Has Your Back?' [report](https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015) and accompanying infographic, and it makes for interesting reading. Once you appreciate that what the EFF is talking about here is how good, measured as a response to a handful of yes or no questions, a bunch of leading tech companies are at protecting our data from government snooping requests. It's not about privacy in the larger scheme of things, just from that particular angle. That said, let's look at how the EFF came to the conclusions that can be seen in the …

The recently revised Facebook community standards page states that the social network is on a mission "to give people the power to share and make the world more open" however it appears that it may have been giving the wrong people the power to share stuff you thought was private. According to security researcher and bug bounty hunter [Laxman Muthiyah](http://www.7xter.com/2015/03/how-i-exposed-your-private-photos.html) Facebook's photo sync feature came with a critical flaw which "allows any malicious Facebook application to read your mobile photos." The vulnerability concerns Facebook's Photo Sync feature for mobile users, which was introduced back in 2012 but because it was …

How the hell is the NSA breaking SSL?

In his essay '[A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/12/how-does-nsa-break-ssl.html)' Matthew Green, a cryptographer and research professor at Johns Hopkins University, asks "how the hell is NSA breaking SSL?" If this is news to you, following the Edward Snowden revelations in The Guardian, then you obviously haven't read the New York Times piece about the NSA 'Bullrun' [briefing sheet](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html?_r=1&) which quite plainly states that the agency has been circumventing exactly the type of encryption protection of everyday Internet communications that we take for granted, such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

With just about everybody snooping around your emails today with the excuse of hunting the bad guys, coding to keep some resemblance of privacy is getting important. I will start out with some simple encryption examples to get this started. You are invited to give us your thoughts and codes. Hopefully, we can improve the code as time goes on. The first example is very simplistic form of a Caesar cipher, simply increasing the ASCII values by one to encrypt and decreasing by one to decrypt. It would be easy to figure that scheme out by looking at the letter …

The newspaper reported that the home screens of websites belonging to the towns of Jouy-le-Moutier, Piscop, Goussainville, Val D'Oise and Ezanville (all surrounding Paris) were defaced with a Jihadist ISIS black flag and a message which translates as "The Islamic State Stay Inchallah, Free Palestine, Death to France, Death to Charlie."

American technology companies are by implication evil, and aiding terrorist groups such as Islamic State/ISIS according to a number of highly influential but terribly ill-informed Western players. Apple and Google have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and implementing full-device encryption by default will help Islamic State to plan future attacks, if we are to believe certain spy masters and career politicians. I use the term 'terribly ill-informed' wisely, and am aware that I will no doubt get plenty of flack from those who think the head of the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) or Director …

In amongst the depravity and illegal excess, of course, were political activists and dissidents looking for an online safe haven in order to escape persecution, prosecution and potentially death.
