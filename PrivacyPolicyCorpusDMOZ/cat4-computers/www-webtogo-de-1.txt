Security Statement
When you access WebToGo’s sites using any modern browser such as Firefox 1.0, Opera 7.0, Netscape Navigator 6.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.5 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to registered Users in your organization.

WebToGo provides each User in your organization with a unique user name and password that must be entered each time a User logs on. WebToGo issues a session “cookie” only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. By matter of choice the session “cookie” does include the username and password of the user. WebToGo does not use “cookies” to store other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs.
In addition, WebToGo is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.
If any parts of the English Approval for the processing of personal data are unclear or invalid, the German version applies.
