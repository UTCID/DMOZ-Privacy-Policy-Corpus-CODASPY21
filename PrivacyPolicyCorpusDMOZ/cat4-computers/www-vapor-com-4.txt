FEES THAT YOU MAY PAY
Some aspects of the Websites may require you to pay a fee or other charge, the details of which are available in various areas of the Websites that feature the ability to purchase products, features or Services. You agree to pay all fees, charges and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your account. We may revise the pricing for products, Services or features offered through the Websites at any time. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. dollars.

MAP POLICIES
In many instances, certain products offered for sale on the Websites are subject to what is referred to as a “minimum advertised price,” or “MAP” policy. MAP is the lowest price distributors and other resellers are allowed to publicly advertises a product for sale. A MAP policy does not apply to the price at which products subject to the MAP policy are actually sold or offered for sale. We remain free at all times to sell products subject to a MAP policy on the Websites at any price we choose.
A MAP policy is used by some manufactures to protect the integrity of their product(s) and brand. Generally, authorized retailers of a product covered by a MAP policy who do not adhere to these guidelines risk losing the right to sell the product subject to that MAP policy. In addition, buyers may not be able to take advantage of post-sale Services (i.e., warranty repair) when purchasing from a retailer that does not comply with a manufacturer’s MAP policy.
MAP policies are intended to protect consumers and sellers from disreputable dealers, giving all authorized retailers specific guidelines on how to advertise the price of the MAP product(s). This helps to ensure that buyers will be able to access the high level of service the manufacture wants purchasers of their product(s) to receive.
If you have any questions regarding whether a particular product purchased on our Websites is subject to a MAP policy, please contact us at the information provided below.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(A) Arbitration. You agree that any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy (“Claim”) by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning your use of the Websites, these Terms, our Privacy Policy and all matters relating to your access to, and/or use of, the Websites, including the products or Services you purchase from us (or from any advertising for any such products or Services) will, at the demand of either party, be resolved by confidential binding arbitration. Arbitration includes but is not limited to: (i) Claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions; (ii) Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii) Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv) Claims regarding our products or Services, sale or return of and/or issue any refund or (v) Claims asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT. BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION IN ANY MATTER ENCOMPASSED BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.
(B) Notice. The party seeking relief under these Terms must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating any action. Notices to Greenlane should be sent to Greenlane, Attention: Legal Department; 1095 Broken Sound Parkway NW, #300, Boca Raton, FL 33487 ADDRESS. The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. We may direct any Notices to you at (a) the mailing address or e-mail address that you most recently provided to us; or (b) a publicly-listed address for you. You and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration.
(C) Administration of Arbitration. If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not state law. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding will be confidential. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this provision, and the arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA. For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this binding arbitration provision. The arbitration shall be conducted in Palm Beach County, Florida. The award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law. You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute. In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this provision, this arbitration provision will govern.
(D) Costs. The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee. We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing. All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
(E) Severability. If any term or section of this provision is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or section of this arbitration provision and will be eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. If any portion of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of these Terms; provided, however, that (i) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration provision will be null and void; and (ii) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration provision will be null and void as to such claims only. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES). IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS. THIS PARAGRAPH IN NO WAY INVALIDATES THE PROVISION TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.
