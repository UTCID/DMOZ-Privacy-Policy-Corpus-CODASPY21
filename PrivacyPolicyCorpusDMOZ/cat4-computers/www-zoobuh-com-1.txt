Why ZooBuh Collects Personal Information
ZooBuh collects personal information to help deliver great customer service.
It enables us to give convenient access to services and focus on improvements and
features that are of interest to the customer. In addition, personal information
helps ZooBuh keep members posted on the latest product announcements, software updates,
special offers, and events that might be of interest. If a customer does not want
to be updated with this information, personal contact information and preferences
may be updated through the account profile. ZooBuh does not rent, sell, or share
personal information about members with other people or non-affiliated companies,
unless permission is granted. However, information may be shared with trusted partners
who work on behalf of, or with ZooBuh, under confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements.
These companies may use personal information to help ZooBuh, but they do not have
any independent right to share this information.
Cookies

browser and operating system information for security reasons and compatibility

some features, such as reminders, message views, etc. do require a pop-up to function
correctly.
Credit Cards and other Payment types
Credit Card information is stored and/or encrypted, for recurring billing purposes
only. Credit card information is shared only with any person, or company directly
involved with the transaction of money for the specific purpose of which it was
intended. This includes the merchant account and/or financial institutions involved
in this transaction. ZooBuh does not save, encrypt or record any CVV, CSC numbers.

to read the privacy policy of any website not part of ZooBuh. This document only
applies to the information collected by ZooBuh.
External Images in emails (Security)
Emails may contain external emails and images which are not controlled by ZooBuh.
Security issues may arise due to these external images. Senders may send a 1x1 pixel
image or a tracked image to determine what you has been viewed. ZooBuh cautions
that when external images are detected, certain options allow for the viewing of
these images. Zoobuh is not responsible for these images. Please exercise caution
when viewing any email containing external images.

are under 13, they may not attempt to register for any ZooBuh services or send any
information to ZooBuh, including name, address, telephone number, or email address.
ZooBuh will delete any information immediately, if the company learns personal information
from a child under age 13 was submitted without parental consent. If someone believes
ZooBuh might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact
the company immediately.
Children between the ages of 13 and 18
