Key SurveyAbout usTerms of Use
Terms of UseDownload as .PDFWorldAPP will provide online survey hosting and other survey services to you, our Customer, under the following terms:You acknowledge that WorldAPP does not regulate and is not responsible for the content of information, files, images,
or other communication transmitted to or by Key Survey.You, the Customer, warrant that you have all rights necessary lawfully to submit all information and materials that
you upload to Key Survey, including, but not limited to, all intellectual property rights.You, the Customer, agree not to publish or transmit any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory,
or racially or ethnically derogatory content, or any content expressing hate toward any person or group of persons
due to race, religion, color, creed, national origin or sexual orientation.You, the Customer, agree to indemnify, defend, and hold WorldAPP harmless from and against all actions brought by a
third party as a result of the publication or transmission of such material or information as described above or as
a result of your use in any way of the services provided by WorldAPP.Zero Spam and Offensive ContentSupplier has a zero-tolerance policy against e-mail 'spamming'. As a condition of using the Subscribed Services, Customer
agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any email messages Customer sends using the Subscribed
Services abide to requirements of CAN-SPAM act and other applicable laws. Supplier reserves the right to monitor Customer's
usage of the Subscribed Services and suspend Customer's access to the Subscribed Services if Supplier judges Customer's
usage to be 'spamming' or otherwise offensive.Commercial EmailsWorldAPP's email distribution functionality is not to be used to send emails that are encouraging recipients to purchase
specific products or services, or collect information that will later be used to sell products or services to specific
recipients. Our customers can use their own email software or that of a third party to send out the invitations, and
WorldAPP's data collection software can be used to capture resulting information. Since some WorldAPP data collection
functionality depends on WorldAPP's software sending out email invitations, some functionality may not be available
to our customers when emails are sent outside of the WorldAPP data collection system.Unusual Transaction PolicyCustomer understands that there is a 'heavy launch' algorithm used within the Supplier's application used to identify
large e-mail distribution launches that could potentially affect system performance. This algorithm calculates amount
of complex logic, number of questions, number of recipients, etc. If the survey has potential for causing system slowdowns,
the 'heavy launch' will be triggered and this will require WorldAPP support intervention. Supplier's support team
will assist with the launch of the survey within 24-48 hours of this request, typically during non-business hours
to ensure there are no issues with the system.Term and TerminationUpon expiration of the initial term for which the services were provided, the subscription will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless
and until either party provides written notice of nonrenewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term.If, at any time, we, WorldAPP, believe that you are in breach of any of the terms and conditions contained in this agreement,
WorldAPP may immediately terminate its obligations under this agreement without liability to you, the Customer.No WarrantiesWorldAPP makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied, for the services to be provided hereunder.Trial AccountTrial account is accessible during the period of thirty (30) days starting on the date of registration.Trial account users have twenty (20) credits and fifty (50) e-mail survey invitations. One (1) credit equals one
(1) completed and submitted survey.Trial account users are not limited to the number of surveys (active or inactive). If the surveys of a trial user
receive more than twenty (20) respondents, the trial user will be able to see only the first twenty (20), as he
will have only twenty (20) credits. All of the other responses will become available when the trial account is upgraded
to one of the paid subscription plans.You, the Customer, agree that WorldAPP shall not be liable to you for any losses or damages of any kind, including,
but not limited to, those that may result from service interruptions, delays, non-deliveries, or mis-deliveries.
Additionally, WorldAPP makes no warranties regarding its ability to recover, and shall not be liable to you for
lost data, lost files, or other information, regardless of how or why data is lost.WorldAPP specifically informs you that the following information in your account cannot be restored:if

statistics, filters, etc.); survey, report, individual responses, and list of incompletes.if
changed/edited: survey layout design, survey logo, other survey settings(logic, alerts, questions order,
etc.)Billing PoliciesWorldAPP will send service invoices to you, the Customer, in advance of your receipt of services. You agree to submit
payment in the amount and currency specified in each invoice upon receipt. Accounts thirty (30) days past due are
subject to suspension or termination and a service resumption fee. Cancellation of an account will result in deletion
of all of your files, including E-mail. You further agree that submission of credit card information to WorldAPP

is greater, on each past due balance not paid within thirty (30) days of the date shown on each invoice.Sharing User Credentials: Sharing user credentials among multiple users is strictly prohibited.Litigation and Attorney's FeesIn the event that any dispute arises out of or relating to this agreement, such dispute shall be resolved in a
court of competent jurisdiction located in Delaware, USA, under Delaware law, and the prevailing party in any
such dispute shall be entitled to reasonable costs, including collection costs and attorney's fees.Entire Agreement and SeverabilityThis represents the complete agreement and understanding between WorldAPP and you, the Customer, with respect to
