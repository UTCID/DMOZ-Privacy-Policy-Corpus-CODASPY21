RealPage Privacy Policy
RealPage, Inc. Corporate Privacy Policy
Last updated: June 1, 2020
RealPage is committed to providing clear and concise information regarding our privacy policies and practices. This Privacy Statement describes how RealPage and its subsidiaries (“we,” or “us”) collect, use, and disclose certain personal information in the course of providing our services. By accessing our website (www.realpage.com) or utilizing our services, you consent to the information collection and handling practices outlined in this statement.
I.	RealPage Services and Scope
RealPage provides comprehensive property management software solutions and services to property owners and managers in the rental housing industry (our “Clients”). Our on-demand product line covers the full spectrum of accounting, leasing, operations, and marketing services (collectively “RealPage Services”). In providing this suite of services, RealPage acts as a service provider under contract to our Clients1. As a service provider, RealPage does not control any of the personal information we process on behalf of our Clients. Our Clients collect and control all such personal information, and RealPage is required to provide our products and services in accordance with Clients’ contractual provisions and instructions regarding data collection, privacy, processing, and security.

RealPage offers direct-to-consumer services that collect personal data directly from residents. Unlike the majority of RealPage Services, these direct-to-consumer services do not operate on behalf of our Clients. These services include: eRenterPlan (insurance), eRenterDirect (insurance), Lease Terms Solutions (insurance), DepositIQ (insurance/surety bonds), and ResidentDirect (money transmission services). Each of these services has a separate privacy policy posted to their designated websites that outlines the privacy practices associated with the services.
Our Clients may administer RealPage Services access for their employee end users. This administration may include control over end user account access and functionality, as well as access and monitoring of end user data and activity. RealPage is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our Clients, and this Privacy Statement is not intended to cover those Client practices. Furthermore, this Privacy Statement does not apply to the privacy or security practices of any third party.
II.	Information Collection
RealPage Services involve the collection and processing of personal information for business purposes. This includes Client resident and prospect information (either provided by Clients to RealPage or collected directly from residents by RealPage acting on behalf of Clients) and Client employee information (collected by RealPage to establish user account access to RealPage Services).
This personal information varies depending on the individual RealPage Services being utilized, and multiple services may be integrated at a Client property. The personal information collected includes the following:
Contact Information & Identification: name, address, telephone number, email address, and emergency contact information
Personal Details: date of birth, social security number, driver’s license/state-issued ID/military ID/passport number, employment history/income, gender, and marital status
Financial Account Information: bank account, credit/debit card, and insurance policy/surety bond information
Property Ledger Information and Documents: resident leases, resident ledger history, utility consumption/expense, property notices and communications, rent/fee payment receipts, and other Client-generated content related to property management and resident history
Credentials and Authentication Information: user names, passwords, password hints and security questions
Technical Information: IP address, device and hardware specifications, and web browser type
Usage Data: logging data that tracks service access, usage, performance metrics, and error reports
III.	Information Use
The personal information collected by RealPage Services is used for a variety of purposes, including:
To fulfill the purpose for which the personal information was collected and provide the requested RealPage Services.
To integrate with apartment community services offered by RealPage or third party service providers contracted by Clients.
To process service requests, transactions, and payments and prevent transactional fraud.
To distribute communications and legally required notices regarding the status of RealPage Services via phone, email, and SMS text.

IV.	Information Sharing & Disclosure
RealPage does not sell personal information collected through RealPage Services.
RealPage may provide personal information to third parties under limited circumstances, including service providers and vendors that support or integrate with the RealPage Services described in this statement. RealPage only shares personal information to the extent reasonably necessary to support RealPage Services requirements, or for the third party vendors or service providers to perform the services on our or our Clients’ behalf. We do not permit third party vendors or service providers to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. However, please note that RealPage does not maintain direct control over the privacy policies and practices of Clients or any other third party companies, agents, or contractors.
In addition, if RealPage enters into any business transition, restructuring, merger, sale, or other transferring of assets, we reserve the right to transfer all RealPage Services information, including all personal information, as part of or in connection with the transaction.
Finally, we will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
Comply with applicable law or respond to valid requests by public authorities, including law enforcement, national security agencies, or other government entities;
Operate and maintain the security of RealPage Services; and
Protect the rights and property of RealPage, including both intellectual property and physical systems infrastructure.

Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.

VI.	Third Party Links to Other Sites
RealPage Services may include links to third party service providers contracted by Clients.

We cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of independent parties and encourage you to review their practices prior to information disclosure.
VII.	Data Security
RealPage implements and maintains appropriate physical, administrative, technical and organizational measures to protect the information we process against unauthorized or unlawful access, use or disclosure, and against accidental loss, damage, alteration or destruction. Under our security policies and practices, access to personal information is restricted and authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. RealPage strives to protect the personal information that we process; however, no security program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personal information. We maintain security incident response policies and procedures to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to personal data we process.
VIII.	Accessing and Updating Personal Information
In the event your personal information is determined to be outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, you may access and update your information by logging into your RealPage Services account or contacting your property manager.
