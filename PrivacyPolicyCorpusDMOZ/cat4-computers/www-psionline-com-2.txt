INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF COOKIES
Our website, client portals, and examination delivery services (our “Site” or “Sites”) use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site. This helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site or sit for an exam and also allows us to improve our Site. This cookie policy provides you with clear and comprehensive information about the cookies and similar technologies we use, and our purposes for using them.
Websites that are accessible from particular parts of the European Union are required to obtain consent to using or storing cookies (or using similar technologies) on your computers or mobile device.  For further information about this policy, please contact privacy@psionline.com
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site may be transmitted to and stored by us or by third-party providers on servers in the United States, or other countries whose laws do not protect privacy at a level equivalent to the one applied in the European Union. For information about our Privacy Shield practices, please see our Privacy Shield Notice or for information on our Privacy Shield certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.
Your Consent
Most browsers automatically accept cookies placement on your computer, by us and our third-party service providers. Click here to see how you can delete and block cookies on our website or update your manage your cookies preferences here..
Please note that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of our sites, and may prevent you from being able to access certain features on the sites.
For further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please visit: https://www.aboutcookies.org/
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our site.
Some, but not all, cookies provide us with personal information, for example where you enter details into a form on our Site.  Cookies may also provide us with information about your IP address (which may be personal information in certain jurisdictions), the duration of your browsing session, your browser type and your operating system.
We use cookies and the information they collect for the following reasons:
to remember browsing preferences such as local language;
to remember details about your previous visits to the Site to personalize and improve your browsing experience;
to administer and organize the Site;
to analyze use of the Site to make improvements to the Site; and
to compile statistics and understand (in general, aggregated terms) who uses our Site.
Key Concepts
First and third-party cookies: whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the domain placing the cookie.
First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by www.psionline.com).
Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.
Persistent cookies: these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
Session cookies: these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
How to delete and block our cookies
You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our site.

These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your internet browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful. Otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your internet browser for more details.

What cookies do we use and why?

The cookies used on our Site are categorized as follows:
Strictly necessary

Preferences
Marketing
‘Strictly Necessary’ or ‘Necessary’ cookies let you move around the Site and use essential features like secure areas. Without these cookies, we cannot provide the requested services.
We use these Necessary cookies to:

For security purposes
Make sure you connect to the right service on our Site when we make any changes to the way the Site works
Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the Site, so if you prevent these cookies we can’t guarantee how the Site or the security on our Site will perform during your visit.
‘Statistics’ cookies collect information about how you use our Site e.g. which pages you visit, and if you experience any errors. These cookies [do not collect any information that could identify you and] are only used to help us improve how our Site works, understand what interests our users and measure the effectiveness of our advertising.
We use statistics cookies to:
Carry out web analytics: Provide statistics on how our Site is used

Obtain data on the number of users of the Site that have viewed a product
Help us improve the Site by measuring any errors that occur

Some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties.  We do not allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.
‘Preferences’ cookies are used to provide services or to remember settings to improve your visit.
We use ‘Preferences’ cookies for such purposes as:
Remember settings you’ve applied such as layout, text size, language, preferences and colors
Remember if we’ve already asked you if you want to fill in a survey
Remember if you have engaged with a particular component or product list on the Site so that don’t show it again
Show you when you’re logged in to the Site
To provide and show embedded video content
Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties. We do not allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.
‘Marketing’ cookies are used to track your visit to our Site and other websites, including the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, which allows third parties to display targeted ads to you on the websites you visit.
We and our third-party service providers use Marketing cookies to:
Link to social networks, like Facebook, that may subsequently use information about your visit to our website in order to provide advertising or other offers that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.
Provide third parties with information on your visit so that they can present you with advertisements or other offers that may be of interest to you.
If you are in the EU, you may opt-out of certain third-party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeting through https://www.youronlinechoices.eu or www.aboutads.info.  Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that those particular members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other third-party websites. If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out pages, and you later erase your cookies, use a different computer or change Web browsers, your preference may no longer be active. Since these cookies are managed by third parties, you should refer to the third parties’ own website privacy notifications and policies for further information (see below for more information about the particular targeting cookies used on our Site).

Internet Advertising Bureau
A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet advertising industry which can be found at:

Local Storage Objects:
We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies:
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
Third Party Analytics:
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
