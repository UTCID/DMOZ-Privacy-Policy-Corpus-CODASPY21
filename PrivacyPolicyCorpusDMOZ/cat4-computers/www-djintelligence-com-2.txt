Privacy Policy
Intelligence, Inc.
("DJ Intelligence") takes your privacy
seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
policy.
What This Privacy Policy Covers
This policy covers how DJ Intelligence
treats personal information that DJ Intelligence collects and receives,
including information related to your past use of DJ Intelligence
products and services. Personal information is information about
you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email
address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to
the practices of companies that DJ Intelligence does not own or
control, or to people that DJ Intelligence does not employ or manage.
Information Collection and Use
DJ Intelligence collects personal
information when you register with DJ Intelligence, when you use
DJ Intelligence products or services, when you visit DJ Intelligence
pages or the pages of certain DJ Intelligence partners, and when
you enter promotions or sweepstakes. DJ Intelligence may combine
information about you that we have with information we obtain from
business partners or other companies.
When you register we ask for information
such as your name, email address, address, zip code, state, country,
phone, and fax. Once you register with DJ Intelligence and sign
in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
DJ Intelligence collects information
about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners,
including information about your use of products and services that
we offer.
DJ Intelligence automatically
receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,
including your IP address, DJ Intelligence cookie information, and
the page you request.
DJ Intelligence uses information
for the following general purposes: to tailor the advertising and
content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services,
improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide
anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
DJ Intelligence may employ the use of 3rd party ad tracking
systems on subscribers and end-users in order to promote
DJ Intelligence and related products or services on 3rd party
sites. This does not include personally identifiable information.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
DJ Intelligence does not rent,
sell, or share personal information about you with other people
or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services
you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following
circumstances:
We provide the information
to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with DJ Intelligence
under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your
personal information to help DJ Intelligence communicate with
you about offers from DJ Intelligence and our marketing partners.
However, these companies do not have any independent right to
share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court
orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal
rights or defend against legal claims;
We believe it is necessary
to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
violations of DJ Intelligence's terms of service, or as otherwise
required by law.
We transfer information about
you if DJ Intelligence is acquired by or merged with another
company. In this event, DJ Intelligence will notify you before
information about you is transferred and becomes subject to
a different privacy policy.
DJ Intelligence displays targeted
advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including
ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with,
view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for
example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
DJ Intelligence does not provide
any personal information to the advertiser when you interact
with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or
viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the
advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting
criteria used to display the ad.
DJ Intelligence does reserve the
right at our discretion only to publicly list companies that are
subscribers to our service in the form of company name and
location. At our sole discretion, we may also from time to time list
the subscriber website URL to show as an example to prospective
or current
subscribers.
DJ Intelligence reserves the right to collect and share billing and
shipping addresses for fraudulent credit card transactions for fraud prevention purposes.
DJ Intelligence reserves the
right to compile anonymous subscriber and end-user information in
the form of statistical information, such as, but not limited to,
the top songs lists or date availability checks. This does not
include personally identifiable information.
Cookies
DJ Intelligence may set and access
DJ Intelligence cookies on your computer.
DJ Intelligence lets other companies
that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their
cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies
is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers
or other companies do not have access to DJ Intelligence's cookies.
DJ Intelligence may use web beacons
to access DJ Intelligence cookies inside and outside our network
of web sites and in connection with DJ Intelligence products and
services.
