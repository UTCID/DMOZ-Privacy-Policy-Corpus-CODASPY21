Privacy Policy
We at Stunnix are committed to respecting your online privacy
and recognise your need for appropriate protection and management of any
personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with
us.
Stunnix has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand
the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify
an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home
or other physical address, an e-mail address or other contact information,
whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit Stunnix's web pages
without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about
yourself.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the web,
we may transfer that Information, within Stunnix or to Stunnix's third party
service providers, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to
other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Stunnix strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe
that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements
may vary from country to country, Stunnix intends to adhere to the principles
set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the
above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries
that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal
Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your
Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is
collected, transferred or retained.
COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Some of our web pages utilise "cookies" and other tracking technologies.
A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect
information about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may
serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a web user.
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to
accept them and how to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie or you
may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you
choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your
original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the web
site.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain
and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and
operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that
our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies
allows us to improve our web site and your web experience. We may also
analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends
and statistics.
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:
NOTICE
Where Stunnix collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post
a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be
collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside
of Stunnix or those working on Stunnix's behalf. Stunnix does not intend
to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who
are not bound to act on Stunnix's behalf unless such transfer is legally
required.
CHOICE
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Stunnix.
The notice we intend to provide where Stunnix collects Personal Information
on the web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to
provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of
Stunnix's web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options,
offers and services that involve our interaction with you.
If you chose to have a relationship with Stunnix, such as a contractual
or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue
to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
SECURITY
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Stunnix or on its
behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the
Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorised access or
disclosure.
ACCESS/ ACCURACY To the extent that you do provide us with Personal
Information, Stunnix wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we
collect Personal Information from you on the web, our goal is to provide a means
of contacting Stunnix should you need to update or correct that Information. If
for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates
and corrections about your Personal Information to webmaster@Stunnix.com
and we will make
reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that
we hold as soon as practicable.
THIRD PARTY SERVICES
Third
parties provide certain services available on Stunnix.com on Stunnix's behalf.
Stunnix may provide information, including Personal Information, that Stunnix
collects on the web to third party service providers to help us deliver
programs, products, information and services. Service providers are also an
important means by which Stunnix maintains its web site and mailing lists.
Stunnix will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third party service
providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Stunnix's behalf.
Stunnix does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your
consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Stunnix's behalf unless
such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against Stunnix's policy to
sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Stunnix.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not
intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years
of age.
COMMITMENT
We are committed to privacy and through our
membership in the Online Privacy Alliance, are actively involved in and support
current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the
Internet. Protecting your privacy on-line is an evolving area, and Stunnix's web
sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands.
If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy
Policy, please contact us at webmaster@Stunnix.com.
WHILE WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE PRIVACY PERFECTION, We will address any issue to the best of our
abilities AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
YOUR CONSENT
By using this
web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to Stunnix's
processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above as well as those
explained where Stunnix collects Personal Information on the web. Should the
Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure
that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes
prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time.
