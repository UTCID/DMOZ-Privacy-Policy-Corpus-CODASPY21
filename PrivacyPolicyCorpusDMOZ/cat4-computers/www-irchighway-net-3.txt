What to do If I'm banned from a channel?
According to IRCHighWay's Acceptable Use Policy, channels founders are to do as they please. Generaly speaking, it means that the Network Staff does not and can not interfere with channels matters.
Most of the times, it is therefore pointless to come around the official help channels, write to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. or anything of the sort; in order to get yourself unbanned from a channel. However, there are a few exceptions to this guideline that I will describe later on.
But what can you do then? The best way to get a channel ban removed is to contact the channel operator that banned you in the first place. You can do this by the mean of a private message or a memo (please read /memoserv help for more information).
If you have no idea who banned you, there is only one way to go: you have to contact the channel founder for assistance. Once again, this can be done by the mean of a private message or a memo.
Of course, you may not know who is the founder of a channel you are banned from, there is a command that you can issue in order to find out his or her nick:
/chanserv info <#channel>
This command, once issued, will give you some information about the specified channel, including the founder's nickname.
Keep in mind that the channel founder may not be around, patience is a virtue, and that he may or may not remove the ban that prohibits you from joining the channel. The founder is the law within a channel. There is no point discussing the decisions he or she makes. Basically, you could be banned from a channel just because the ops do not like you, that's perfectly legit and the Network Staff will not do anything.
However, there are a few exceptions to the channel founder and ops almighty will; as I said earlier in this article.
What are these exceptions?
If the decision of a channel founder, admin or op is against the network's Acceptable Use Policy, the Network Staff is allowed to interefere and can therefore take action if they feel fit; upon the results of their investigation. It is only in such situations that you should go to the #abuse channel and submit a request for assistance.
I think you should now be able to answer properly if you ever get banned from a channel on IRCHighWay. I wish you good luck and although you are now prepared, I hope you will never find yourself in such a situation ;)
Have a nice week,
Arbin.
Additional note:
If you are banned from a channel where you are an op, depending on the channel's settings, you may or may not be able to overwrite the ban or to invite yourself.
Assuming that your access level is high enough:
To unban yourself: /chanserv unban <#channel>To invite yourself: /chanserv invite <#channel>
MemoServ Help
HELPMemoServ is a utility allowing IRC users to send short messages to other IRC users, whether they are online at the time or not, or to channels(*). Both the sender's nickname and the target nickname or channel must be registered in order to send a memo. MemoServ's commands include:
SEND
Send a memo to a nick or channel
CANCEL
Cancel last memo you sent
LIST
List your memos
READ
Read a memo or memos
DEL
Delete a memo or memos
SET
Set options related to memos
Type /msg MemoServ HELP command for help on any of the above commands.(*) By default, any user with at least level 10 access on a channel can read that channel's memos. This can be changed with the MemoServ LEVELS command.
SENDSyntax: /msg MemoServ SEND {nick | channel} memo-textSends the named nick or channel a memo containing memo-text. When sending to a nickname, the recipient will receive a notice that he/she has a new memo. The target nickname/channel must be registered.
CANCELSyntax: /msg MemoServ CANCEL {nick | channel}Cancels the last memo you sent to the given nick or channel, provided it has not been read at the time you use the command.
LISTSyntax: /msg MemoServ LIST [channel] [list | NEW]Lists any memos you currently have. With NEW, lists only new (unread) memos. Unread memos are marked with a "*" to the left of the memo number. You can also specify a list of numbers, as in the example below:
LIST 2-5,7-9
Lists memos numbered 2 through 5 and 7 through 9.
READSyntax: /msg MemoServ READ [channel] {num | list | LAST | NEW}Sends you the text of the memos specified. If LAST is given, sends you the memo you most recently received. If NEW is given, sends you all of your new memos. Otherwise, sends you memo number num. You can also give a list of numbers, as in this example:
READ 2-5,7-9
Displays memos numbered 2 through 5 and 7 through 9.
DELSyntax: /msg MemoServ DEL [channel] {num | list | LAST | ALL}Deletes the specified memo or memos. You can supply multiple memo numbers or ranges of numbers instead of a single number, as in the second example below.If LAST is given, the last memo will be deleted.If ALL is given, deletes all of your memos.Examples:
DEL 1
Deletes your first memo.
DEL 2-5,7-9
Deletes memos numbered 2 through 5 and 7 through 9.
SETSyntax: /msg MemoServ SET option parametersSets various memo options. option can be one of:
NOTIFY
Changes when you will be notified about new memos (only for nicknames)
LIMIT
Sets the maximum number of memos you can receive
Type /msg MemoServ HELP SET option for more information on a specific option.
SET NOTIFYSyntax: /msg MemoServ SET NOTIFY {ON | LOGON | NEW | OFF}Changes when you will be notified about new memos:
ON
You will be notified of memos when you log on, when you unset /AWAY, and when they are sent to you.
LOGON
You will only be notified of memos when you log on or when you unset /AWAY.
NEW
You will only be notified of memos when they are sent to you.
OFF
You will not receive any notification of memos.
ON is essentially LOGON and NEW combined.
SET LIMITSyntax: /msg MemoServ SET LIMIT [channel] limitSets the maximum number of memos you (or the given channel) are allowed to have. If you set this to 0, no one will be able to send any memos to you. However, you cannot set this any higher than <num>.
INFOSyntax: /msg MemoServ INFO [channel]Displays information on the number of memos you have, how many of them are unread, and how many total memos you can receive. With a parameter, displays the same information for the given channel.
SERVADMIN SET LIMITSyntax: /msg MemoServ SET LIMIT [user | channel] {limit | NONE} [HARD]Sets the maximum number of memos a user or channel is allowed to have. Setting the limit to 0 prevents the user from receiving any memos; setting it to NONE allows the user to receive and keep as many memos as they want. If you do not give a nickname or channel, your own limit is set.Adding HARD prevents the user from changing the limit. Not adding HARD has the opposite effect, allowing the user to change the limit (even if a previous limit was set with HARD).This use of the SET LIMIT command is limited to Services admins. Other users may only enter a limit for themselves or a channel on which they have such privileges, may not remove their limit, may not set a limit above <num>, and may not set a hard limit.
SERVADMIN INFOSyntax: /msg MemoServ INFO [nick | channel]Without a parameter, displays information on the number of memos you have, how many of them are unread, and how many total memos you can receive.With a channel parameter, displays the same information for the given channel.With a nickname parameter, displays the same information for the given nickname. This use limited to Services admins.
BotServ Help

I'm New to IRC
You don't even know what it does and what it is about? You only heard that it exists and want to try it out? Well then this document will give you the answers you need. Click on "read more" to read the whole article.
Table of contents:
1. What is IRC?2. The IRC Client mIRC3. Nickserv and registered nicks4. Finding a channel5. What you should know about channels6. Basic commands7. What is SSL
1. What is IRC?
The Internet Relay Chat (short IRC) is one of the most popular and interactive chat services on the internet. If you think this website is the "IRC" then you are mistaken. This site is just an online portal for our visitors to view news we provide and to share information, which can't be shared in the fast living world of IRC. Usually the IRC service consists of several servers, which are linked to a network. Everyone in the world can connect to one of the servers and chat with other users who are connected to the same network. If you want to use our IRC service you need a IRC client. There are many different like: mIRC X-Chat Zirc irssi HydraIRC BitchX and many more.
2. The IRC Client mIRC
The most popular IRC Client used by Windows users is "mIRC". And for that reason this HowTo will explain what you have to do if you want to connect to IRCHighWay using the mIRC Client. First of all: "Where do I get mIRC" This is easy. Visit http://www.mirc.com and download it from the download section there. The link to the download section is: http://www.mirc.com/get.html The download and the use of mIRC is free for the first 30 days. Then a startup screen appears to remind you to register it. But you will still be able to use it. Install and run it. On startup you should see a dialog called mIRC Options after a short startup screen, which appears only on the unregistered version. If this dialog doesn't pop up or you accidentally closed it then you can (re)open it by pressing the keys ATL + O or clicking on View-> Options Highlight the very first category Connect like you see in the link below: Nick settings The fields have the following meaning:
Full Name: Don't use your real name here. Add something fake there but don't just smash your keyboard and add a bunch of random letters. There are no restrictions so you can use any chars (including spaces).
Email Address: As in the full name don't add your real email address here - use your imagination. There are restrictions on what you can use on this field. You can use "a-z A-Z 0-9 - _ .". You can use other chars there since mIRC will allow this but you won't be able to connect to IRCHighWay.
Nickname: Well this is kind of self explaining. Your nickname should not be longer than 30 chars and may contain the following characters: "a-z A-Z 0-9 _ - [ ] ` { } | ^ \"
Alternative: If the Nickname you choose is used by someone else mIRC will try to log on using the alternative nickname you specify here.
After this you need to specify the network you want to connect. Click on the category Servers. Server settings Do the following settings there:
IRC Network: IRCHighway
IRC Server: IRCHighway: Random serverThe next part is optional. Select the category Identd. Identd settings The Ident needs a closer explanation. You don't actually need to enable this feature but in some cases it is better if you have enabled it. When you connect the IRC Server sends a ident request on port 113. If you have enabled the Identd server and this port isn't blocked by any firewall or router then your mIRC will reply to that request. On some few IP ranges you might need, due heavy to spamming, a working Ident. Do the following settings:
check Enable Identd server
check Show Identd requests
check only when connecting
check Use ID from email address
User ID: This will be ignored if you have checked Use ID from email address so you don't need to set anything here. Leave System and Port untouched. The other categories should be ok for now and the settings there should fit your needs. Close the mIRC Options by clicking OK. Then let's try to connect by typing /server or /server irc.irchighway.net or just by clicking the connect button located in the top left of the mIRC Window (see picture below). Connect Button After this a lot of text should appear in the Status Window and the mIRC Favorites should pop up (see link). mIRC Favorites You can safely uncheck Pop up favorites on connect and close this window by clicking OK. If that worked you are connected to IRCHighWay. Before I proceed in navigating on IRC we should have a look at Nickserv.
3. Nickserv and registered nicks
You may see some notices from Nickserv that the nick you use is already taken by someone else. The notice looks like this: Nickserv notice Well in this case you need to choose another nickname. You can do this easily by typing
/nick nick_of_your_choice
e.g.
/nick john_doe
.
Nickserv will keep telling you this notice until you found a nick, which is not registered by someone else. If you want to use the same nick every time when you connect you may register it. The service called Nickserv handles the nicks of all registered users of the Network. The nick registration is free and you just need an email to confirm that you are a real person. To register the nick you currently use type
/nickserv register password email
e.g.
/nickserv register supersecret This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
Note: Your email address will be kept confidential. We will never send you spam mails or mails were we request private data (like passwords, banking accounts, etc). After this you will see a notice from nickserv telling you this:
- NickServ - A passcode has been sent to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it., please type /msg NickServ confirm <passcode> to complete registration
Check your email account for new mails. Some email providers like hotmail may drop our mail sent by our services into your spamfolder. Open the mail and you will find a text like this:
Hi, You have requested to register the following nickname some_nickname. Please type " /msg NickServ confirm JpayrtZSx " to complete registration. If you don't know why this mail is sent to you, please ignore it silently. PLEASE DON'T ANSWER TO THIS MAIL! irchighway.net administrators.
Just copy and paste the part /msg NickServ confirm JpayrtZSx into your status window of you mIRC. Then press the enter key. A text like:
- *NickServ* confirm JpayrtZSx - - NickServ - Nickname some_nickname registered under your account: *q@*.1413884c.some.isp.net -- NickServ - Your password is supersecret - remember this for later use.- * some_nickname sets mode: +r
should appear after this. This means you finished your registration and the nick can only be used by you or you can force someone else if he/she uses your nick to give it back to you. If you disconnect then you need to tell nickserv that the nick is yours. you can do that by:
/nickserv identify password e.g. /nickserv identify supersecret
if the password is correct it should look like this:
* some_nickname sets mode: +r - - NickServ - Password accepted - you are now recognized.
In mIRC you can do the identification process automatically so you don't have to care about this anymore. Open the mIRC Options by pressing he key combination Alt + O then select the category Options and click on Perform you will see this dialog: Perform window
Check Enable perform on connect and add: if ($network == irchighway) { /nickserv identify password } in the edit box called Perform commands Close the options by clicking OK. Now your mIRC will automatically identify you every time you connect to IRCHighway.
4. Fining a channel
Well now you have your nick registered and have identified for your nick but you don't see much of the actual IRC because you are in no channel right now. Channels are the rooms of a IRC network. Imagine if there are 15000 people connected and everyone see the text of each other.
Well now the question may come up: How do I find a room? You can list the names of all rooms by typing /list. After you send this command a Window should pop up showing you the following information: for example: #help 55 :: IRCHighWay Helpdesk :: This is an IRC related ONLY help channel :: where:
#help: the name of the channel
55: the actual number of visitors of that channel
:: IRCHighWay Helpdesk :: This is an IRC related ONLY help channel :: the topic of the channel where you can get a short information of what the channel is about. If you do just /list then a very long list will be shown and it would be a pain to find the channel you are searching for. Therefore you can search for a specific pattern in the channel name. For example if you look for a help channel type /list help. After this all channels with "help" in the name will pop up. You can join a channel by double-clicking on it's name or by typing: /join #channel-name e.g. /join #help.
5. What you should know about channels
Lets use the example with the channel #help. Type /join #help. A window pops up and you joined our official network help channel. The channel window looks like this: Channel window After you joined a channel you should always read the topic which you can find in the 2nd line after you joined a channel and maybe welcome notices like the one you see in our example sent by the nick "IRCHighWay" (the brown text). Topic and welcome notices usually give you information about the rules of the channel. On most channels you might be banned if you violate a rule which is shown in the topic. The nicknames you see at the left side of the channel window are the users which are currently in the channel. You might have noticed that some of them have tags like !, @, % or + in front of their nicks. This is the status of the nick in the Channel.
! = channel admin
@ = channel operator
% = channel halfoperator
+ = voice
The difference between these tags is the access the people have on the channel. But you can say for sure that all people with !, @ and % are somehow responsible for the channel.
6. Basic commands
I think the question of how to send some text to the channel is not relevant. You might have figured that out yourself by now. But there are several ways to send some text to another person besides the chat in the channel where other people can see what you type. These are called notices and private messages. As the name already says - these forms of messages can only read the person you sent it to. To send a notice do
/notice nick text
If you want to chat with someone in private then the "private message" would be the better choice. Just double click on a nick you want to chat with and a private message window will pop up. There you can chat with that person in private. However, if you don't have a nick to click on this will be a bit complicated so there exists a command for that. To open a private message window (short query) just type
/query nick
You might notice that if you double click into the query some weird information pop up in your status window like:
Borg is This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. * Borg
Borg has identified for this nick
Borg on #idlerpg @#vhost @#script !@#middle-earth !@#irchighway !@#help !@#abuse
Borg using irc.irchighway.net The IRCHighWay Network
Borg is using a secure connection (SSL)
Borg is a Network Administrator
Borg is a Services Administrator
Borg is available for help
Well this is called a /whois. A /whois nick shows you more or less useful information about a nick. There you can see:
the hostmask of someone
if the nick has identified for a registered nickname
in what channels the nick joined
what server the nick uses
if the nick uses an encrypted connection.
The last 3 lines have only people who are running the Network (IRCops). If you use our example of the #help channel then all admins / operators / halfoperators are IRCops. Well I think these commands are all you need for now but if you have questions about some specific things you can always ask patiently in #help.
List of basic commands:
/list: list all non secret channels which are currently in use/list pattern: list all non secret channels which match the pattern/join #channel: join #channel/part #channel: leave #channel/notice nick text: send a notice to a nick/msg nick text: send a private message to a nick/query nick: opens a private message window for the nick Actually one question might be already there and because this comes up relatively often.
7. What is SSL?

REGISTERSyntax: /msg ChanServ REGISTER channel password descriptionRegisters a channel in the ChanServ database. In order to use this command, you must first be a channel operator on the channel you're trying to register. The password is used with the IDENTIFY command to allow others to make changes to the channel settings at a later time. The last parameter, which must be included, is a general description of the channel's purpose.When you register a channel, you are recorded as the"founder" of the channel. The channel founder is allowed to change all of the channel settings for the channel; ChanServ will also automatically give the founder channel-operator privileges when s/he enters the channel. See theACCESS command (/msg ChanServ HELP ACCESS) for information on giving a subset of these privileges to other channel users.NOTICE: In order to register a channel, you must have first registered your nickname. If you haven't, /msg ChanServ HELP for information on how to do so.

SET SUCCESSORSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel SUCCESSOR nickChanges the successor of a channel. If the founder's nickname expires or is dropped while the channel is still registered, the successor will become the new founder of the channel. However, if the successor already has too many channels registered (<num>), the channel will be dropped instead, just as if no successor had been set. The new nickname must be a registered one.
SET PASSWORDSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel PASSWORD passwordSets the password used to identify as the founder of the channel.
SET DESCSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel DESC descriptionSets the description for the channel, which shows up with the LIST and INFO commands.
SET URLSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel URL [url]Associates the given URL with the channel. This URL will be displayed whenever someone requests information on the channel with the INFO command. If no parameter is given, deletes any current URL for the channel.
SET EMAILSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel EMAIL [address]Associates the given E-mail address with the channel. This address will be displayed whenever someone requests information on the channel with the INFO command. If no parameter is given, deletes any current E-mail address for the channel.

SET BANTYPESyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel BANTYPE bantypeSets the ban type that will be used by services whenever they need to ban someone from your channel. bantype is a number between 0 and 3 that means:
0:
ban in the form *!user@host
1:
ban in the form *!*user@host
2:
ban in the form *!*@host
3:
ban in the form *!*user@*.domain
SET KEEPTOPICSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel KEEPTOPIC {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the topic retention option for a channel.

SET TOPICLOCKSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel TOPICLOCK {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the topic lock option for a channel. When topic lock is set, ChanServ will not allow the channel topic to be changed except via the TOPIC command.
SET MLOCKSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel MLOCK modesSets the mode-lock parameter for the channel. ChanServ allows you to define certain channel modes to be always on, off or free to be either on or off.The modes parameter is constructed exactly the same way as a /MODE command; that is, modes followed by a + are locked on, and modes followed by a - are locked off. Note, however, that unlike the /MODE command, each use of SET MLOCK will remove all modes previously locked before setting the new!Warning: If you set a mode-locked key, as in the second example below, you should also set the RESTRICTED option for the channel (see HELP SET RESTRICTED), or anyone entering the channel when it is empty will be able to see the key!Examples:
SET #channel MLOCK +nt-iklps
Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and s off. Mode m is left free to be either on or off.
SET #channel MLOCK +knst-ilmp my-key
Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modes i, l, m, and p off. Also forces the channel key to be "my-key".
SET #channel MLOCK +
Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free to be either on or off.
SET PEACESyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel PEACE {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the peace option for a channel. When peace is set, an user won't be able to kick, ban or remove a channel status of an user that has a level superior or equal to his via ChanServ commands.
SET PRIVATESyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel PRIVATE {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the private option for a channel. When private is set, a /msg ChanServ LIST will not include the channel in any lists.
SET RESTRICTEDSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel RESTRICTED {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the restricted access option for a channel. When restricted access is set, users who would normally be disallowed from having channel operator privileges (users with negative access levels and, if secure ops is set, users not on the access list) will instead be kicked and banned from the channel.
SET SECURESyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel SECURE {ON | OFF}Enables or disables ChanServ's security features for a channel. When SECURE is set, only users who have registered their nicknames with ChanServ and IDENTIFY'd with their password will be given access to the channel as controlled by the access list.
SET SECUREOPSSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel SECUREOPS {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the secure ops option for a channel. When secure ops is set, users who are not on the userlist will not be allowed chanop status.
SET SECUREFOUNDERSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel SECUREFOUNDER {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the secure founder option for a channel. When secure founder is set, only the real founder will be able to drop the channel, change its password, its founder and its successor, and not those who are IDENTIFY'd with ChanServ.
SET SIGNKICKSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel SIGNKICK {ON | LEVEL | OFF}Enables or disables signed kicks for a channel. When SIGNKICK is set, kicks issued with ChanServ KICK command will have the nick that used the command in their reason.If you use LEVEL, those who have a level that is superior or equal to the SIGNKICK level on the channel won't have their kicks signed. See /msg ChanServ HELP LEVELS for more information.
SET XOPSyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel XOP {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the xOP lists system for a channel. When XOP is set, you have to use the AOP/SOP/VOP commands in order to give channel privileges to users, else you have to use the ACCESS command.Technical Note: when you switch from access list to xOP lists system, your level definitions and user levels will be changed, so you won't find the same values if you switch back to access system!You should also check that your users are in the good xOP list after the switch from access to xOP lists, because the guess is not always perfect... in fact, it is not recommended to use the xOP lists if you changed level definitions with the LEVELS command.Switching from xOP lists system to access list system causes no problem though.
SET OPNOTICESyntax: /msg ChanServ SET channel OPNOTICE {ON | OFF}Enables or disables the op-notice option for a channel. When op-notice is set, ChanServ will send a notice to the channel whenever the OP or DEOP commands are used for a user in the channel.

Lists AOP entries numbered 2 through 5 and 7 through 9.
The AOP CLEAR command clears all entries of the AOP list.The AOP ADD and AOP DEL commands are limited to SOPs or above, while the AOP CLEAR command can only be used by the channel founder. However, any user on the AOP list may use the AOP LIST command.This command may have been disabled for your channel, and in that case you need to use the access list.

If a reason is given with the command, that reason will be used when the user is kicked; if not, the default reason is "You have been banned from the channel".The AKICK STICK command permanently bans the given mask on the channel. If someone tries to remove the ban, ChanServ will automatically set it again. You can't use it for registered nicks.The AKICK UNSTICK command cancels the effect of the AKICK STICK command, so you'll be able to unset the ban again on the channel.The AKICK DEL command removes the given nick or mask from the AutoKick list. It does not, however, remove any bans placed by an AutoKick; those must be removed manually.The AKICK LIST command displays the AutoKick list, or optionally only those AutoKick entries which match the given mask.The AKICK VIEW command is a more verbose version of AKICK LIST command.The AKICK ENFORCE command causes ChanServ to enforce the current AKICK list by removing those users who match an AKICK mask.The AKICK CLEAR command clears all entries of the akick list.

With this command, you can define the access level required for most of ChanServ's functions. (The SET FOUNDER and SET PASSWORD commands, as well as this command, are always restricted to the channel founder.)LEVELS SET allows the access level for a function or group of functions to be changed. LEVELS DISABLE (or DIS for short) disables an automatic feature or disallows access to a function by anyone other than the channel founder. LEVELS LIST shows the current levels for each function or group of functions. LEVELS RESET resets the levels to the default levels of a newly-created channel (see HELP ACCESS LEVELS).For a list of the features and functions whose levels can be set, see HELP LEVELS DESC.

For more information on a specific command, type

STATUS
NOTICE: This service is intended to provide a way for
IRC users to ensure their identity is not compromised.
It is NOT intended to facilitate "stealing" of
nicknames or other malicious actions.
Abuse of NickServ
will result in, at minimum, loss of the abused
nickname(s).
REGISTER
Syntax: /msg NickServ
REGISTER password [email]
Registers your nickname in the NickServ database.
Once
your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS
commands to configure your nick's settings as you like
them.
Make sure you remember the password you use when
registering - you'll need it to make changes to your nick
later.
(Note that case matters!
EPONA, Epona, and
epona are all different passwords!)
Guidelines on choosing passwords:
Passwords should not be easily guessable.
For example,
using your real name as a password is a bad idea.
Using
your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,
in fact, NickServ will not allow it.
Also, short
passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so
you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.
Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.
The parameter email is optional and will set the email
for your nick immediately. However, it may be required
on certain networks.
Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won't be given to
any third-party person.
This command also creates a new group for your nickname,
that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing
the same configuration, the same set of memos and the
same channel privileges. For more information on this
feature, type /msg NickServ HELP GROUP.
GROUP
Syntax: /msg NickServ
GROUP target password
This command makes your nickname join the target nickname's
group. password is the password of the target nickname.
Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,
memos, and channel priviledges with all the nicknames in the
group, and much more!
A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even
if a nick of the group is dropped, you won't lose the
shared things described above, as long as there is at
least one nick remaining in the group.
You can use this command even if you have not registered
your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you'll
need to identify yourself before using this command. Type
/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This
last may be not possible on your IRC network.
It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered
nick because it will be registered automatically when
using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to
change your group) only if your network administrators allowed
it.
You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is
not possible.
Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.
IDENTIFY
Syntax: /msg NickServ
IDENTIFY password
Tells NickServ that you are really the owner of this
nick.
Many commands require you to authenticate yourself
with this command before you use them.
The password
should be the same one you sent with the REGISTER
command.
LOGOUT
Syntax: /msg NickServ
LOGOUT
This reverses the effect of the IDENTIFY command, i.e.
make you not recognized as the real owner of the nick
anymore. Note, however, that you won't be asked to reidentify
yourself.
DROP
Syntax: /msg NickServ
DROP [nickname]
Drops your nickname from the NickServ database.
A nick
that has been dropped is free for anyone to re-register.
You may drop a nick within your group by passing it
as the nick parameter.
In order to use this command, you must first identify
with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more
information).
ACCESS
Syntax: /msg NickServ
ACCESS ADD mask
ACCESS DEL mask
ACCESS LIST
Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.
This
is the list of addresses which will be automatically
recognized by NickServ as allowed to use the nick.
If
you want to use the nick from a different address, you
need to send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ
recognize you.
Examples:
ACCESS ADD anyone@*.bepeg.com
Allows access to user anyone from any machine in
the bepeg.com domain.
ACCESS DEL anyone@*.bepeg.com
Reverses the previous command.

Displays the current access list.

to change nicks instead of the usual 60.
If you select
IMMED, user's nick will be changed immediately without being
warned first or given a chance to change their nick; please
do not use this option unless necessary.

KILL option.

taken it; this does the same thing that NickServ does
automatically if someone tries to use a kill-protected
nick.

user online with the same nickname as the user you're
trying to recover your nick from.
This causes the IRC
servers to disconnect the other user.
This fake user will
will remain online for one minute to ensure that the other
user does not immediately reconnect; after that minute, you
can reclaim your nick.

GHOST nickname [password]
Terminates a "ghost" IRC session using your nick.
A
"ghost" session is one which is not actually connected,
but which the IRC server believes is still online for one

computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection
goes down while you're on IRC.
