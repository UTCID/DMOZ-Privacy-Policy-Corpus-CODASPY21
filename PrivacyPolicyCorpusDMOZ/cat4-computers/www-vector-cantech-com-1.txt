Principles
'Personal data' are any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; these are normally names, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, IP addresses, order details, advertising and contract details, and information about the use of media we offer, e.g. access time on our website or our newsletters and other comparable categories of data.
We only process and use your personal data where there is a legal ground for this or where you, as the data subject, have given us your consent.
The following points are covered in the information provided below:Which personal data do we collect and process? Why do we process your data and what is the legal basis for doing so? How long will we store your data and to whom might we transfer them? What are your data protection rights? Who can you contact if you have any questions?
Automated Data (server log files)
Whenever you use the internet, your browser automatically transfers certain information, which we collect and store in server log files (hereinafter also referred to as "log files"). The information stored in the server log files includes, but is not limited to:Your IP address Your browser version and type Your operating system Your referrer URL The hostname of your accessing computer Your time of query on our serverSuch data is not combined with data from other sources.
The basis of data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits data to be processed for the purposes of performance of a contract or to take steps prior to entering into a contract.
The system needs to store your IP address temporarily to be able to display the website on your computer. For this to happen, your IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.
The data stored in the log files are used to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data help us to optimize our website and to maintain the security of our IT systems.
We delete personal data as soon as they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected.
Data that is stored in log files will be deleted within 30 days or less. It is possible that data will be stored and combined with other data for analysis and optimization purposes, and to improve the offer of information on our website. In this case, the user's IP address will be deleted or altered so that it can no longer relate to the accessing client.
The collection of data for provisioning the website and storing of data in log files is carried out for the purposes of error analysis. It is absolutely necessary for the operation and the ongoing enhancement of our website. As a result, you, as the user, have no means of objecting to this.
General Collection of Data
Our website continues to collect and store data in an anonymous form for marketing and optimization purposes. This visitor data is saved under a pseudonymous user ID and can be used to generate a usage profile. Cookies may be used for this. These are, however, collected and stored only in pseudonymized form. The data collected are not used to personally identify website visitors and are not combined with the personal data of the person to whom the pseudonym refers. You will find more information on the use of cookies in the section below "Use of cookies".
Some of the data are collected to ensure that the website functions properly. Other data are collected for the purposes of analyzing user behaviour.
In addition, personal data are only collected, processed or used if you disclose them to us voluntarily while visiting our website, for example, during a download or while placing an order, while booking a training course, when requesting information or offers from us, when reporting defective software or hardware, when providing us with feedback, subscribing to our newsletter or when applying for a job online.
The legal basis for this processing and for sending you our newsletter is that we have received your consent as user (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You will find more information on subscribing to our newsletter in the section "Newsletter".
If you order goods or services from us, we will only collect and use your personal data insofar as this is necessary for the establishment, implementation or termination of the contract. The legal basis of this kind of data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits data to be processed for the performance of a contract or to take steps prior to entering into a contract. No further collection or processing can take place without your express consent. The customer information collected will be deleted after the order has been completed or when the business relationship ends. Legal record keeping requirements remain unaffected.
Furthermore, your personal data will only be processed if you, as user, have so consented (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
Transfer of Personal Data
Your personal data will only be transferred to a third party insofar as this is necessary for the establishment, implementation or termination of a contract with you or for the delivery of goods or services. This applies particularly to the transfer of your data to a shipping company, credit institution or other service company used for performing a contract. Third parties of the kind described may also be other companies within the Vector Group.
The legal basis of data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits data to be processed for the purposes of performance of a contract or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract, a legitimate interest on our part in the transfer of personal data, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR or your explicit consent.
Personal data may be transferred to recipients located outside the EEA in third countries only insofar as there is an appropriate level of data protection at the recipient's location or where you have given your consent to the transfer. If you would like a summary of the recipients in third countries and information about the rules in place to ensure that there is an appropriate level of data protection, please use the information provided in the section headed "Contact".

Newsletter
How to subscribe/unsubscribe
As a visitor to our website, you will be offered the option of subscribing to our company newsletter. By looking at the entry form used to subscribe to the newsletter, you can see which personal data will be sent to the processor.
At Vector, we use our newsletter to inform our customers, business partners and potential customers at regular intervals about our company's offerings. You will essentially only be able to receive our newsletter if you have a valid e-mail address and have subscribed to the newsletter. For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will first be sent to the e-mail address that you used to subscribe to the newsletter (double opt-in). The purpose of this confirmation e-mail is to verify that you have authorized the use of your e-mail address for the receipt of the newsletter.
Data that you provide us with for receiving our newsletter will only be used for that purpose.
Should you later decide that you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may, at any time, stop receiving it by revoking your consent with future effect.
Each newsletter contains a link for revoking your consent. By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter. Alternatively, you can, at any time, unsubscribe from the newsletter simply by going directly to our website (www.vector.com/unsubscribe/) or by writing to us (see more on this in the section "Contact").
Your consent as user provides the legal basis for processing your personal data and sending our newsletter to you (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
Contact, Feedback and Order Forms
By clicking on the "Send" button on the contact, feedback and order forms and the transfer of your information, you give your consent to our processing and storing of the information which is in the contact form, and in particular of your personal data, for the purposes for which you wish to have it transferred. We will erase such data as soon as it is no longer needed for its intended purpose.
The data will only be sent to the addressee specified on the respective contact form.
The data you supply on the contact, feedback and order forms is thus only processed on the basis of the consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) given to us when you send the form. You may, at any time, revoke your consent with future effect. All that you need to do is send us an e-mail with an informal notice revoking your consent (VGDataprotection@vector.com).
