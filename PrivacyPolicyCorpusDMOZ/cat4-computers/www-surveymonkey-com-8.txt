This will make it easier for you to manage your preferences regarding cookies and similar technologies on our sites. In the meantime, you are able to manage cookies within your browser.1. What is a Cookie?Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other mobile device) that you use to access any of the SurveyMonkey websites (the Sites), so we can recognize repeat users. Each cookie expires after a certain period of time depending on what we use it for. In our Cookies Notice, we use the word “cookies” as a catchall term to include not only cookies, but also other technologies such as pixels, web beacons and page tags. Like most commercial websites we use cookies on SurveyMonkey web pages. We use cookies for several reasons. Below we list and describe the various types of cookies we use on our Site.2. What Cookies Do We Use?Below we list the different types of cookies that may be used on the Sites. Section 7 includes detailed lists of cookies used on each of our Sites which include information about type of cookie, expiry periods and links to third party sites where applicable.The Sites use both first party cookies (which are set by the Sites being visited) and third party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Sites).3. Required Cookies(Example: a cookie used for login authentication)Certain cookies are necessary in order for the Sites and Services to operate correctly and remain secure, to ensure essential functionality, to measure and analyze site traffic at the aggregate level and to stabilize the Sites. Often these cookies are set in response to a request for service or functionality made by you. We have to load required cookies for legitimate interests pursued by us in delivering essential functionality of our Sites and Services to you and your respondents.4. Functional Cookies(Example: a cookie that stores your language preference)These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and collect information about your use of the Sites and Services which enable us to improve functionality. For example, these cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Sites, allow us to present the Sites according to the settings you selected, help us record any difficulties you have with the Sites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. In some cases these cookies allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Sites, rather than the usage of a single person (except where that is part of the necessary function of the cookie).5. Advertising Cookies(Example: cookies set from domains corresponding to our marketing affiliates, like ads.linkedin.com or bing.com or facebook.com)We may use cookies to market SurveyMonkey services to you on third party websites or to measure and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts so that we can tailor our advertising more effectively.We also contract with third party advertising networks that may collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, emails, and on third party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting website navigational information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. You may see these advertisements on other websites. Generally, information provided to third parties via Advertising Cookies does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after we receive it. Please note that cookie data is typically encrypted so only authorized services can interpret the data. Additionally, many services aggregate or obfuscate individual data to minimize privacy concerns.6. How Do I Manage Cookies?New Cookie Management Tool coming soon!

Do Not Track DisclosureRegulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission have promoted the concept of Do Not Track as a mechanism to permit Internet users to control online tracking activity across websites through their browser settings. Since no industry standard has been adopted, we currently do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do-not-track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit the SurveyMonkey website or use SurveyMonkey.Community:DevelopersFacebookTwitterLinkedInOur BlogInstagramYouTubeAbout Us:Leadership TeamBoard of DirectorsInvestor RelationsApp DirectoryNewsroomOffice LocationsJobsSitemapHelpPolicies:Terms of UsePrivacy NoticeCalifornia Privacy NoticeAcceptable Uses PolicySecurity StatementGDPR ComplianceEmail Opt-InAccessibilityCookies NoticeUse Cases:Online PollsFacebook SurveysSurvey TemplateScheduling PollsGoogle Forms vs. SurveyMonkeyEmployee Satisfaction SurveysFree Survey TemplatesMobile SurveysHow to Improve Customer ServiceAB Test Significance CalculatorNPS CalculatorQuestionnaire TemplatesEvent Survey Sample Size CalculatorWriting Good SurveysLikert ScaleSurvey Analysis360 Degree FeedbackEducation SurveysSurvey QuestionsNPS CalculationCustomer Satisfaction Survey QuestionsAgree Disagree QuestionsCreate a Survey Online QuizzesQualitative vs Quantitative ResearchCustomer SurveyMarket Research SurveysNPS SurveySurvey Design Best PracticesMargin of Error CalculatorQuestionnaireDemographic QuestionsTraining SurveyOffline Survey360 Review TemplateCopyright © 1999-2020 SurveyMonkey
