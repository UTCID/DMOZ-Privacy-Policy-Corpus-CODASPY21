Website Design - The Awful Truth
With website designers you get a few good, a lot
bad and some really ugly.
The reality is, there are companies out there
who promise you gold and give you lead or charge the earth for peanuts. We
regularly come across website designers whose fees
are beyond ridiculous for what they actually provide. Some even charge extortionate
fees for supporting services you never actually receive.
