Department of Commerce
Washington, DC 20230 In the Matter of Digital Entertainment and
Rights Management Comments of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center
July 17, 2002
1. Existing digital rights management systems, designed to
provide a more
predictable and secure environment for the transmission of
copyrighted material,
are ineffective and do so at the expense of consumers' rights and
innovation.
Existing digital rights management ("DRM")
technologies designed
to produce a more predictable and secure environment for
transmission of copyrighted
materials invariably do so at the expense of the consumers'
rights: to privacy;
to freedom of expression; to 'fair use' rights; and, the
promotion of science
and the useful arts generally. Far from creating positive
conditions for commerce,
DRM subsidizes inefficient channels of content-delivery in the
face of more
efficient and more equitable systems of distribution. Existing DRM systems threaten consumers' privacy.
Today, individuals are free to explore different ideas presented in books,
music, and movies anonymously. [1]
Existing DRM systems weaken this
right by allowing
copyright owners to monitor private consumption of content. In an attempt
to secure content, many DRM systems require the user to identify
and authenticate
a right of access to the protected media. In the case of Microsoft's eBook
Reader, this means that the media software and users' choices in books are
digitally linked to the hardware system and to the Passport
profiling system. [2]
Some systems, such as Microsoft's Windows Media
Player, assign a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to the media device that
facilitates tracking. [3]
These systems create
records that
enable profiling and target marketing of individuals' tastes by the private
sector. Law enforcement can also gain access to these records by subpoena
or by simply purchasing them. In February 2002, Sunncomm, Inc., a DRM systems developer, and
Music City
Records settled a lawsuit by a California woman who objected to
their practice
of tracking and disclosing personal information - including music
consumption
patterns - to third-parties with no opt-out scheme. The
settlement agreement
required the companies to provide notice to consumers of their information
collection practices and to refrain from requiring consumers to
disclose their
personal information as a condition of downloading, playing, or listening
to a CD. [4]
Linking personally-identifiable information to content may
result in "price
discrimination." Price discrimination is the practice of
selling an item
at different costs to different consumers. It can be facilitated where the
seller knows the consumer's identity, and can associate the identity with
a profile that includes financial information on the consumer. DRM systems
may enable content owners to control access to content, but also to adjust
the price of content based on the consumer's identity. Alternative models exist that would provide copy protection
while protecting
privacy; they are discussed in more detail in the response to Question #3,
below. DRM systems cannot recognize consumers' "fair use"
rights. 'Fair use' allows individuals to interact with content to
promote cultural
production, learning, innovation, and equity between content
owners and consumers.
'Fair use' includes libraries' and educators' rights to provide content to
users, the right to sell physical copies of certain content that
one acquires
lawfully (the "first sale" doctrine), and the ability to make a
backup copy of software and music.
It is impossible for DRM systems to incorporate 'fair use' principles in
code because they are difficult to define and evolve over time.
No DRM standard
developed affords users these rights. [5]
Nor is it likely that any future DRM technology
could do so, as engineers would need to be able to program a federal judge
onto a computer chip." [6]
Any
attempt to enumerate
the conditions of 'fair use' in code will necessarily give it an
artificially
rigid scope and shrink the rights and expectations Americans now enjoy in
law. DRM systems threaten consumers' freedom of expression and the
public domain. DRM restricts access to the public domain at the whim of copyright owners
and creates obstacles to the free flow of information, even for legitimate
purposes. The Constitution grants copyright to authors for limited terms,
after which works are supposed to enter the public domain. However, even
with authorization, an archivist cannot be confident in his or her ability
to migrate and store content protected by DRM, particularly when
limitations
are placed on which devices can be used to access the content or
when access
is provided in conjunction with a pay-per-use system. The unfortunate fact is that copyright holders have a commercial, albeit
short-sighted, incentive to design DRM systems restrictively
when it comes
to protected uses. [7]
Understandably, this has led many to worry that the architecture
of cyberspace
will create too much, rather than too little, control over the
distribution
of content.
"[T]he technology of cyberspace, in combination with
the protections
of law, will produce greater control over the use of
copyrighted material
than the balance intended by the Copyright
Act." [8]
[Emphasis added]
The combination of DRM and legal remedies against circumvention
of copyright
protection or the altering of rights management information means
that copyright
holders could write, through code, their own copyright laws to
put legal force
behind any restrictions chosen by a copyright holder. Professor
Charles Nesson
of Harvard Law School recently described the problem as follows:
"[W]ithout respect for time limits on copyright, the
amount of uncopyrightable
material within the 'protective envelope', or the doctrines
of first sale
and fair use… copyright holders are thus staking a claim far in excess
of the exclusive rights explicitly granted them in existing copyright
legislation." [9]
Professor Lawrence Lessig of Stanford Law School, perhaps the
most outspoken
critic of the negotiation of public law by private code, [10]
suggests that we are entering
an age in which "The problem will center not on copy-right
but on copy-duty,
- the duty of owners of protected property to make that
property accessible." [11]
The Business Software Alliance, an industry watchdog, dismisses
this objection,
stating that "such proposals are intended to preserve the
existing balance
[of interests established by the Berne Convention] between
[creators'] rights
and exceptions to those rights (including access to works in the
public domain)." [12]
But the road to
copyright Hell
is paved with such intentions and there is plenty of evidence that we are
already on our way. [13]
DRM systems threaten consumers with criminal sanctions. Criminal sanctions are blunt instruments and should be employed
with great
caution in the copyright context. Until recently, penalties were
invoked only
for serious, damaging infringers, and not against non-infringers or de
minimis infringers. [14]
Provisions in the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act change this balance by prohibiting
the circumvention
of DRM technologies, even where there is no commercial copyright
infringement
or criminal intent to defraud copyright holders.
The Secure Digital Music Initiative ("SDMI"), an
industry sponsored
research effort, challenged scientists to break their industry encryption
code for the purpose of determining if it was suitably secure. In return,
the SDMI offered a reward, but only if researchers who broke the
code promised
not to publish their findings. [15]
Princeton University Professor Edward Felten and a team of
researchers cracked
the code but chose not to claim the reward. Instead, they decided
to publish
their results at a conference. In response, the SDMI threatened Felten and
his team with possible litigation, claiming that the paper,
which explained
how the team had defeated watermarking technology meant to protect digital
music, was a circumvention technology under the DMCA. Public
pressure forced
the SDMI to back down and Felten subsequently launched a counter-suit with
help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The suit was dismissed, but
the chilling effect on academic freedom had already been felt. In July 2001, U.S. Federal agents arrested Dmitry Sklyarov at
the "DEF
CON" conference in Las Vegas, after he described a program
he had written
to export content from Adobe Systems' proprietary encrypted
eBook format to
its non-encrypted portable document format (PDF). The action Sklyarov had
engaged in was not prohibited in his native country, Russia,
where the program
had been developed.In response to Sklyarov's arrest, Rep. Rick
Boucher (D-VA),
pointed out that Sklyarov's technology could be used for
legitimate purposes
such as copying a digital book to another device (i.e. a PDA) for personal
use. He stated, "We now have seen the law being misused…
this went too
far." [16]
Sklyarov was
released in December 2001 in exchange for testifying against his employer,
Elcomsoft, for whom he had written the decryption program. Last August, a Dutch cryptographer, Neils Ferguson, reported that he had
found a flaw in Intel's digital content protection technology,
but has refused
to publish it because he fears ending up in Dmitry Sklyarov's
shoes the next
time he lands in the U.S. [17]
Intel has indicated
that Ferguson
is welcome to present his work, but if the FBI chooses to track him down,
it's out of their hands.
[18]
This is not much incentive for Ferguson to
publish his findings
and Intel will suffer as a result. DRM systems threaten consumers' ability to use free and open
source software. DRM schemes and laws that require embedding copy protection into devices
endanger the development of free and open-source software. Free
and open-source
software developers rely on reverse engineering to write programs that can
interact with hardware. This practice is illegal under the DMCA.
Additionally,
some DRM standards require that software be "tamper-resistant."
"Tamper-resistant" is defined in such a way that it
makes open source
implementations non-compliant.
Existing DRM systems threaten the innovation and the
promotion of science
and the useful arts.
The ability of intellectual property owners to misjudge the
benefits of new
information and communications technologies to the point of
actual or potential
self-inflicted harm can never be underestimated. [19]
David Boies, a
prominent attorney
who represented Napster in its recent travails, reminds us that Hollywood
has waged a kind of neo-Luddite battle against technology for
over fifty years,
"Cable television came along and copyright owners said, 'Oh, this is
terrible. They're reproducing our copyrighted shows and not
paying us.' They
sued to stop it." [20]
In the 1954 Canadian case of Canadian Admiral Corp. v.
Rediffusion,
Inc., [21]
the court held that non-consensual cable-based retransmission
infringed neither
the then-existing 'public performance right', nor the
then-existing 'communication
right'. Fifty years later, the result is an explosion in cable-viewing and
a demand for content that has tremendously enriched the very
same copyright
holders who fought against this technology. Today, some of the
largest companies
on Canada's national stock exchange are cable companies. The
same story was
repeated here in the U.S. In the late seventies and early eighties, the battle between
copyright and
technology once again grew heated. In Sony v. Universal
City Studios,
[22]
copyright holders sought to enjoin the sale of video tape
recorders, declaring that "the VCR is… to the American film producer
and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman
alone…."
[23]
Luckily for the public, equipment manufacturers
and
for the motion picture industry, the Supreme Court did not agree with this
analogy nor with the argument generally that manufacturers should be held
liable for unauthorized copying by the public. The court held that where a
technology functioned as a tool for infringement, but was capable
of significant
non-infringing uses, supplying the technology to consumers did not violate
the law. Justice Stevens, delivering the opinion of the court,
declared that
"audiences may increase and, given market practices, this should aid
plaintiffs rather than harm them." [24]
Allowing an injunction
to issue in such a case would disserve the public interest. Copyright holders can often be heard to argue that what matters is which
use of the technology predominates. That has never been the
law, and, indeed, in the Sony case, it was absolutely
clear that more
than 80 percent of the use was copyright infringement. The issue
is not which
is the predominant use, but rather, is there any substantial
non-infringing
use? And in fact, in Sony, the Supreme Court did not say there had
to be any actual substantial non-infringing uses - it said that
the technology
merely had to be capable of substantial non-infringing uses.
DRM systems threaten consumers' expectations and set the
stage for a pay-per-use
business model.
DRM systems can limit users' interaction with media. Through
limiting interaction,
DRM technologies can change users' over time expectations about
control and
use of digital content.
[25]
DRM developers also may be attempting to
acclimate consumers
to a pay-per-use business model, one where consumers lose rights to access
content that has been purchased.
2. Existing DRM standards and systems create major obstacles to the
open commercial exchange of digital content. Consumers are the ultimate arbiters of any DRM system. [26]
In order for a standard to be
useful, it must be adopted by a critical mass of consumers. Any framework
that does not take into account the public interest in privacy, freedom of
speech, and 'fair use' in copyright is doomed to alienate the
very individuals
at which it is aimed and will thus fail. This is the primary
weakness of all
current DRM systems: they do not take into account the public interest. Further, as has already been discussed at length in response to Question
#1, existing DRM standards call for proprietary systems which
impinge on the
neutrality of the network, making it more difficult to innovate
future, unforeseen
uses - not only for DRM, but for all applications. Finally, as will be discussed in the responses to Questions #3 and #4, DRM
standards that do not take adequate account of the public
interest will fail. 3. A future framework for success will recognize public
interests. At a recent Congressional hearing on the consumer benefits of
DRM, the Vice-President
of Microsoft's Windows New Media Platform Division recognized
that DRM systems
cannot alone solve the piracy problem.
"Microsoft and others in the industry learned from
their technical
protection efforts in the 1980s, using DRM protections as an
anti-piracy
club, without adequate regard for consumer convenience and
expectations,
risks alienating lawful consumers and impeding the growth of
legitimate
distribution channels. Instead, content owners must combine
the effective
use of DRM tools with new business models that give
consumers realistic
and attractive alternatives to piracy."
[27]
A successful DRM technology will protect consumer privacy Traditionally, copyright and privacy were compatible because
copyright controls
public distribution, performance and communications.
[28]
DRM technologies change this equation to include
the surveillance
and control of private use of digital content online. Many existing
DRM technology facilitate the profiling of consumers' preferences
and consumption
patterns. While this is not a new phenomenon, profiling in the digital age
is more problematic because it is often more invasive and less transparent
to the consumer. A successful DRM system will not force a consumer to
identify himself
or herself for the benefit of accessing online entertainment.
Instead, a successful
system will only confirm the eligibility of a particular consumer
to perform certain actions (i.e. receive a subscription, fill a
prescription,
make a bill payment, etc.).
[29]
A successful DRM system will not impinge 'fair use' rights. At the Congressional hearing on the consumer benefits of today's
DRM systems,
Rep. Howard Berman (D-CA), ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on
Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, noted that "consumers
are understandably concerned about how DRM systems may restrict
their expectation
to be able to make fair uses of copyrighted works…" and that Congress
must "give serious consideration to how today's
DRM-protected products
and services affect the fair use expectations of consumers." [30]
At the same meeting Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) argued that
"DRM technology
will ultimately fail if it prevents [fair use] and other consumer
expectations
in the name of outdated business models. Put simply, the rights
of the copyright
owner to control their work must be balanced with the rights of
the consumer.
Traditionally, copyright law has aspired to do just that. The
great challenge
today is to maintain that balance in the digital world by finding ways to
prevent and punish digital pirates without treating every
consumer as one."
[31]
A successful DRM system will not impinge consumers' freedom
of expression
or the public domain. Copyright is a critical part of the process of creativity. While a great
deal of creativity would not exist without the protections of the law, the
same can be said of the existence of a meaningful public domain. The goal
of law should be to push cultural products quickly into a
public-domain ''commons''
where they can be enjoyed by all - and, perhaps, transformed
into something
new. [32]
Any successful
DRM system will need to recognize and facilitate this goal. A successful DRM system will not render free or open source software
non-compliant. DRM systems are used, by copyright holders, to retain market share and
protect copyright, by constraining what consumers can do with
digital content,
devices to access that content and by making it expensive to
switch from one
proprietary product or standard to another. [33]
The architecture of digital
rights management facilitates and expands monopolies of market
power and allows
copyright holders and technology developers to control not only
users' present
behavior, but more importantly, their future options and choices. Successful DRM standards and systems must give consumers the
greatest amount
of individual choice, including the choice to use free or
open-source software
systems. A successful DRM system will not impact network neutrality
or discourage
legitimate unintended uses of content or infrastructure.
To take just a few examples, Internet telephony, peer-to-peer,
and electronic
commerce are all applications far outside the range of
expectations of those
who designed the Internet (or even those who, much later, created
the World-Wide
Web). Indeed, e-mail itself, the first true "killer app" of the
Internet, was an unintended by-product hacked by early users of
the network,
not the point of the network itself. [34]
By keeping the cost
of innovation
low in the future - especially in the context of broadband media
- the design
of the successful DRM standards should respect the neutrality of networks
and will facilitate innovation not dreamed of by those who design
the standards.
4. Current consumer attitudes towards online entertainment demonstrate
the failures in current digital rights management systems. Our transactions in cyberspace - commercial and otherwise - are mediated
more by private code than public law or by public laws giving legal force
to private code. If copyright is a bargain - a relationship between equal
stakeholders - then the subsuming of accountability in the relationship is
a betrayal of that relationship. When individuals feel betrayed
in relationships,
they often begin to act outside of them; we see this manifesting
in the widespread
piracy on the Internet. [35]
The continued growth of broadband penetration indicates clear
consumer demand
for rich-media content: music, movies, and other forms of online
entertainment.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's February 2002
report on national
internet use, "The rate of growth of internet use in the
United States
is currently two million new internet users per month.
[36]
Consumers enjoy online entertainment because it is convenient and easy to
access and share digital content. Consumers enjoy the freedom of
listening,
reading or watching from the comfort and privacy of their own
home. Unfortunately,
in the absence of legitimate services the online demand is
manifested largely
through piracy. [37]
According to online polls, consumers consider anonymity of consumption of
content to be vital to their online activities. Most consumers
are concerned
with corporate profiling and marketing strategies and want
legislation protecting
their right to privacy online. According to the Wall Street
Journal/NBC News
Poll in the Fall of 1999 of 2,025 adults by phone found that the
loss of personal
privacy was the number one risk of Americans as twenty-first
century approaches.
29% of respondents reported that the "loss of personal privacy"
was a top concern. Privacy outranked other high-profile concerns
such as overpopulation
(23%), terrorist acts (23%), racial tensions (17%), world war
(16%), and global
warming (14%).
[38]
A more recent poll by BusinessWeek/Harris Poll: A Growing
Threat, BusinessWeek
Magazine, March 2000 conducted by phone of 1,014 adults found
that 89% were
uncomfortable with schemes that merged tracking of browsing habits with an
individual's identity, 95% were uncomfortable with profiles that included
tracking of browsing habits, identity, and other data, such as income and
credit data, 63% were uncomfortable with tracking users' movements on the
Internet, even when the clickstream was not linked to
personally-identifiable
information, 92% were uncomfortable with web sites that shared
user information
with other organization, 93% were uncomfortable with web sites
that sold user
information to other organizations and finally 91% were uncomfortable with
information sharing that allow tracking users across multiple web
sites.
[39]
In a series of surveys conducted by Georgia Institute of
Technology's Graphic, Visualization, & Usability (GVU) Center
repeatedly
demonstrated strong support for Internet Anonymity. In the GVU
surveys, individuals
expressed "strong agreement" with the statement that
anonymity on
the Internet is valuable [40]
This means that individuals want accountability and security when online
and want to know when information is being collected, its
purposes, and whether
it is being sold to other entities. A successful DRM system must take into
account these consumer demand for privacy and anonymity of access.
Both EPIC [41]
and EFF [42]
maintain extensive
online resources on DRM technologies. We encourage the Department to
draw upon these resources, as you go forward. We also request to meet
with you or your staff to discuss these issues.
