Terms & Conditions
Terms and Conditions Your Rights and Responsibilities Internet Access Service AgreementEffective November 11, 2014This Internet Access Service Agreement (“Agreement”) is between you and TOAST.net. By purchasing or using TOAST.net’s Internet access, e-mail, web hosting, or any other services (“Service”) and any software, hardware or other equipment provided by TOAST.net (“Equipment”) and any firmware or software used by TOAST.net to provide the Service, whether embedded in any Equipment, or used in connection with the Service (collectively "Software"), you agree to be bound by and comply with the following: Service and Term.
TOAST.net agrees to provide Service in exchange for monthly payment from you. Your service is paid in advance and provided to you on a month-to-month basis. You will be automatically billed on the first of each calendar month, using the credit card associated with your online account. If you wish to suspend automatic billing, you must notify TOAST.net in accordance with the provisions in Service Termination. Alternatively, you can elect to pay for service for an entire year as provided on the TOAST.net site.  Payments and Billing.
You will make payments to TOAST.net for the Service and Equipment using your cash, check, money order or credit, debit, or other acceptable bank card (the "Card"). You will ensure that the Card information you have provided to TOAST.net is valid at all times. Failure to provide valid Card information or Card status may result in Service suspension or termination. Charges for Service may be found under “My Account.” (My Account is TOAST.net's web-based online account management system that allows you to view your account status, view and pay for service, make changes to your account profile at any time and purchase additional services at any time). Whenever you update your Card information on file with us, TOAST.net may charge a reasonable fee to validate your Card. TOAST.net will bill you on a monthly basis. Monthly charges will be automatically charged to your Card on record as specified in any applicable recurring payment plan you enter with TOAST.net. You expressly agree that TOAST.net may charge your Card all amounts associated with your TOAST.net account. You will pay TOAST.net all outstanding balances when due. Accounts not paid in full by the due date are subject to suspension or termination by TOAST.net. Persons applying for service must be 18 years of age or older. To avoid service suspension or termination you must maintain valid Card information on your account. If your Card expires or the account is closed or suspended and you have not provided TOAST.net with valid replacement Card information, your account may be suspended or terminated. Before Service can be reactivated, you must pay TOAST.net all amounts due. You may also be required to pay a reasonable re-activation fee per account to cover TOAST.net's administrative costs associated with the termination.  Service Availability.
You acknowledge that TOAST.net Service is not available in some areas. Within coverage areas, service availability, signal strength, quality, and network speeds may be lower than advertised or be insufficient for use of the Service. Service activation may take up to 30 days depending on the type of service. DSL service may require a one-year commitment and early termination of such service will result in a termination fee (see Service Termination).  Service Usage.
We reserve the right to safeguard our network from abuse, excessive bandwidth consumption, on current dial-up, cable and DSL sessions, or any activity that compromises the performance of our network. We may limit throughput speeds, control the amount of data transferred, and suspend, modify or terminate service, without notice, if your usage adversely impacts our network or exceeds the monthly allowance of your data plan. All excess usage may be billed at a rate in accordance with the service plan you selected. We may monitor your compliance with the above but will not monitor the content of your transmissions except as otherwise expressly permitted or required by law.  Prohibited Uses.
Services may not be used in a manner that violates any law (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws) or this Agreement.  Website Terms of Use Policy.

No refunds or credits will be made for service outages for any reason, whether such outages are the result of planned or unplanned maintenance performed by TOAST.net or for any other reason. From time to time, TOAST.net or its applicable suppliers or network providers may perform maintenance on its network at such times as each may determine in their sole discretion. Maintenance or service interruptions may occur without notice to you. TOAST.net will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance outages so as to minimize the impact on its customers, but cannot guarantee that your Service will not be interrupted. You acknowledge and agree that TOAST.net shall not be responsible for any losses or damages suffered by you as a result of any Service interruptions due to maintenance outages.  Credits.
No credit or adjustment will be made for interruptions or degradations of the Service.  Billing Disputes.
You must notify TOAST.net in writing no later than thirty (30) days after receiving your Card or bank account statement if you dispute any TOAST.net charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived.  Third-Party Fees.
