Thus, your Personal Information needs to be Processed, so we may perform the contract and provide our services (Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR).
2. For legitimate business interests
We Process your Personal Information for our legitimate business interest (Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR):

We have a legitimate interest in analysing how our Customers and Users use our Service and Platform, to improve and expand our customer base. Users of the Platform who have expressed their interest in receiving marketing communication to their email address give us their free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent.

At the same time, they expect that the communication we will send should be consistent with their interests. Personalized marketing communication allows our Customers to use our Service more effectively and benefit from our attractive offers. For profiling, we use only the Data our Customers or Users provide us with or the Data concerning their activity within the Platform or Service. We’re only interested in what you do on our Platform or when you use our Service, and not what you do on other websites.
