Governmental Agencies can opt for
our Institutional Terms of Service
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Welcome to WhenToWork.com. WhenToWork, Inc. ("W2W"), provides its online service and mobile apps ("Service") to you ("User"), subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using our Service.
Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these TOS. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these TOS. If you disagree with any part of the TOS then you do not have permission to access the Service.
These TOS apply to all individuals accessing the Service through your W2W account and you are responsible for ensuring all individuals accessing your account are aware of and comply with all TOS stated terms and conditions.
2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
W2W currently provides Users in the United States, Canada and other Non-European Union ("EU") Countries with paid subscription access to online resources, including various online scheduling abilities, (the "Service"). Fees are based on the number of employees added into the W2W account and the duration paid, as more specifically described online at: http://WhenToWork.com/pricing.htm. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any changes that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new W2W features shall be subject to this TOS. You understand and agree that use of the Service is at your sole risk and is provided "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE" and that W2W assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications, data entry or personalization settings.
Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account if any User is found to be infringing on a copyright.
You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third-party posts on or through the Service. However, by posting Content using the Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service. W2W has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all Content provided by users.
3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree:
(a) When you create a paid subscription with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.
(b) When contacting W2W customer service you will be honest about your identity, name and company title and any information about your request.
(c) While the person who initially creates the W2W account is the "Main Manager" (the one person who can add and edit other managers) W2W has the authority to change the Main Manager on the account at our discretion at any time. W2W adheres to strict Main Manager change guidelines to protect your account, and the data contained therein, from unauthorized access and modification.
(d) When a W2W account is created to schedule employees of an organization, that organization is considered the owner of the account.
Anyone who makes a payment is considered an agent for the owner and all rights to the account belong to the organization.
4. W2W PRIVACY POLICY
Registration Data and certain other information about Users is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at https://whentowork.com/privacy.htm.
5. USER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
You will create a username and password upon completing the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that login information, and are fully responsible for all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or login. You agree to immediately notify W2W of any unauthorized use of logins on your account or any other breach of security.
It is recommended that you sign out from your account at the end of each session, especially on a shared device. W2W cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.
6. USER CONDUCT
You understand that all information, data, text, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means that you, and not W2W, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. W2W does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will W2W be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted through the Service;

You acknowledge and agree that W2W may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of W2W, its users and the public.
You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

You and W2W agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Orange, California. The failure of W2W to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
