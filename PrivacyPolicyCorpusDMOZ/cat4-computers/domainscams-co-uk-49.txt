Legislation
Home: Consumer Law :
Trading Schemes Act 1996 and Trading Schemes Regulations 1997
Trading schemes, also known as direct selling schemes, multi-level marketing or various other names, involve participants earning money by selling the scheme’s goods or services, often from home. These two pieces of legislation set out the rules which a trading scheme should follow.
Certain information must be included in advertisements for such schemes and in contracts which anyone considering joining the scheme must receive. In the first seven days after signing the contract you should not be asked to pay the scheme more than £200 in total and you have cancellation rights up to 14 days after signing the contract. It is a criminal offence to run a scheme which does not comply with these rules.

Domain Name Facts - know the facts, avoid being scammed
International & UK domains are registered instantly - no other company is informed of the registration and no-one can intervene
International (.com .net .org) domains can be registered for 1 - 10 years, whereas UK (.co.uk .org.uk .ltd.uk .plc.uk .me.uk) domains are registered and renewed at 2 year intervals - it is not possible to register a UK domain for anything more or less than 2 years
Domain names can be registered cheaply, quickly and easily online, you do not necessarily need an agent to register for you
Companies that sell domain names by telesales are almost always scammers
A registration company is not obliged to check trademarks and company names before agreeing to register any domain - this is the registrant's responsibility
Owning a trademark or company name does not automatically entitle you to the matching domain names
It is not possible to "earmark" or reserve a domain name
DON'T send money to companies you've never heard of
