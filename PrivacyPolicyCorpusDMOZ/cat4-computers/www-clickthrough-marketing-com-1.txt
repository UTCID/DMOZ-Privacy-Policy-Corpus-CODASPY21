We would like to send you information about our services and products which may be of interest to you.  If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at a later date.
You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your information to other members of our group.
If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please email privacy@clickthrough-marketing.com or click the unsubscribe at the bottom of our marketing email communications.
Access to your information, correction and deletion- your rights
The GDPR grants you the right to access particular Personal Data that we hold about you.  You therefore have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you.  If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal information, please email or write to us at the following address: c/o Phil Robinson, ClickThrough Marketing Ltd, Charter House, Lichfield, WS13 6QA.
We shall respond promptly to any such request and in any event, within one month from the point of receiving the request and all necessary information from you. In certain circumstances, we may make a small charge for this service.   Our formal response will include details of the Personal Data we hold about you, including the following:
Sources from which we acquired the information;
The purposes for Processing; and
The persons or entities with whom we are sharing the information.
You also have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have the right to ask us to transmit it to another controller if technically possible.
We want to make sure that your Personal Data is accurate and up to date.  You may ask us to correct or remove without delay any information about you that you think is inaccurate by emailing us at privacy@clickthrough-marketing.com or writing to us at the above address.
You have the right to seek a restriction of the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.  Further, you have the right to lodge an objection if you feel that one of the grounds relating to your particular situation apply. When you exercise your right to object, we must stop any processing unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing, which override your interest, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

How long will we hold your data for?

You will have the opportunity to opt out or update or delete Personal Data at any point should you need to do so and details are set out in this policy as to how to achieve this.
Our need to use your personal information will be reassessed on a regular basis and we will dispose of Personal Data which we no longer require.
Transferring your information outside of Europe
As part of the services offered to you through this website, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area. For example, some or our third-party providers may be located outside of the EEA.  Where this is the case we will take steps to make sure the party receiving the data agrees to provide the same or similar protection that we do and that the information they receive is used only in accordance with our instructions.  By submitting your Personal Data, you are agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing.  Where our third-party suppliers are in the US we have ensured that their services fall under the “Privacy Shield” whereby participating companies are deemed to have adequate protection and therefore facilitate the transfer of information from the EEA to the US.]
If you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EU to give you with those services.
Complaints
If you feel that your personal data has been processed in a way that does not comply with the GDPR, you have a specific right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.   The supervisory authority will then inform you of the progress and outcome of your complaint.  The supervisory authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner’s Office.
