Araize GDPR Policy
The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which regulates how companies protect EU citizens’ personal data, takes effect on May 25, 2018. As part of this, companies need explicit permission from EU residents to send them communications.
Your Nonprofit and GDPR
If you have constituents in the EU, regardless of where you are, the GDPR applies to your organization. EU constituents must explicitly express consent to receive communications from your organization.
FastFund Online and GDPR
Keep track of consent in FastFund Online using Email Selections and Email Preferences.
You can set up email restrictions using Codes and Email Select as as filters when generating exports for mailings and emails.
How does FastFund Online help you obtain and track consent from your constituents? By May 25, 2018:
If you have an online form collecting data from constituents, you need to have an opt-in checkbox for any address that is from the EU.
All constituents can be marked as Do No Mail, or their email addresses can be deselected, if they choose to opt-out of any communications sent from your organization.
