PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
THIS CONTAINS TERMS AND CONDITIONS REGARDING CUSTOMER LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES FOR USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SIGNING UP FOR ANY SERVICES.
These Universal Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) is an agreement between INMOTION HOSTING, INC. (“Company”) and the party (“Customer”) set forth in the related order form, which is incorporated herein by this reference (together with any subsequent order forms submitted by Customer, the “Order Form”), and applies to the purchase of all web based products and services ordered by Company to Customer on the Order Form (collectively, the “Services”).

WHEN CUSTOMER SIGN UP FOR AND/OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICES SUCH CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Modification to this Agreement and/or the Services.
Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change or modify this Agreement, and any other policies or agreements posted on Company’s website (“Policies”) which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to Company’s website (“Company’s Site”).
Customer’s use of Company’s Site or the Services after such changes or modifications have been made shall constitute Customer’s acceptance of this Agreement as of the last revised date stated above. If Customer does not agree to be bound by this Agreement as of the last revised date, Customer should not use or continue to use Company’s Site or the Services.
Company may occasionally notify Customer of changes or modifications to this Agreement by electronic mail. It is therefore important that Customer keep Customer’s Company account (“Account”) information accurate and current. Company assumes no liability or responsibility for Customer’s failure to receive an electronic mail notification if such failure results from an inaccurate Account information.
Company may terminate Customer’s use Company’s Site or the Services for any violation or breach by Customer of any of the terms of this Agreement or Policies.
COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, CHANGE, OR DISCONTINUE ANY ASPECT OF COMPANY’S SITE OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRICES AND FEES FOR THE SAME, AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.
Authority To Contract.
Company’s Site and the Services are available only to individuals (“Users”) who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. By using Company’s Site or the Services, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is (i) at least eighteen (18) years of age, (ii) otherwise recognized as being able to form legally binding contracts under applicable law, or (iii) is not a person barred from purchasing or receiving the Services found under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.
If Customer enters this Agreement as a representative or on behalf of a corporate entity or third party that retains or may retain ownership in an Account, Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the legal authority to bind such corporate entity or third party to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, in which case the terms “Customer” or “User” shall refer to such corporate entity or third party. If, after Customer’s electronic acceptance of this Agreement, Company finds that Customer does not have the legal authority to bind such corporate entity or third party, Customer will be personally responsible for the obligations contained in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any payment obligations. Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from Company’s reliance on any instruction, notice, document or communication reasonably believed by Company to be genuine and originating from an authorized representative of Customer’s corporate entity or third party. If there is reasonable doubt about the authenticity of any such instruction, notice, document or communication, Company reserves the right (but undertakes no duty) to require additional authentication from Customer. Customer further agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement for transactions entered into by Customer, anyone acting as Customer’s agent and anyone who uses Customer’s account or the Services, whether or not authorized by Customer.
Customer’s Account.
In order to access some of the features of Company’s Site or use some of the Services, Customer must create an Account. Customer represents and warrants to Company that all information Customer submits when Customer creates an Account is accurate, current, and complete, and that Customer will keep such Account information accurate, current and complete. If Company has reason to believe that the Account information is untrue, inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete, Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend or terminate the Account. Customer is solely responsible for the activity that occurs on the Account, whether authorized by Customer or not, and Customer must keep the Account information secure, including without limitation all Customer number or login, password, payment method(s). For security purposes, Company strongly recommends that Customer change Customer’s password periodically for any Account.
If the Customer acts on behalf of a corporate entity or third party, upon request by Company, Customer shall provide Company with any contact or other information related to the true owner of the relevant Account.
Customer agrees to abide by all U.S. Export Laws (as defined herein).
Customer must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of the Account. Customer may be liable for any loss Company or others incur caused by an Account, whether caused by Customer, or by an authorized person, or by an unauthorized person.
Acceptable Use Policy and Content
Under this Agreement and Policies, Customer shall comply with Company’s then current Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), as amended, modified or updated from time to time by Company, which currently can be viewed here or under the Legal Details section of Company’s Site, and which is incorporated in this Agreement by this reference.
Customer hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed the AUP and that the terms of the AUP are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the AUP, the terms of the AUP shall govern. Company does not monitor the content that is submitted to, stored on or distributed or disseminated by Customer via the Services (collectively, the “Customer Content”). Customer Content also includes (but is not limited to) content of Customer’s website(s), customer(s) and/or user(s).
Some of the features of Company’s Site or the Services may allow Users to view, post, publish, share, store, or manage ideas, opinions, recommendations, or advice via forum posts, literary, artistic, musical, or other content (“User Content”). All content submitted through an Account is considered User Content. By posting or publishing User Content to Company’s Site or through the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Company that (i) Customer has all necessary rights to distribute User Content via Company’s Site or via the Services, either because Customer is the author of the User Content and has the right to distribute the same, or because Customer has the appropriate distribution rights, licenses, consents, and/or permissions to use, in writing, from the copyright or other owner of the User Content, and (ii) the User Content does not violate the rights of any third party.
Customer understands and agrees that the content posted and/or stored on the Customer’s website(s) will not contain adult content, pornography nudity of any kind, and/or the written word of a sexual nature.
Customer understands and agrees that posting and/or storing of material that contains hate speech is not permitted.
Customer understands and agrees that all Customer Content posted and/or stored on Customer’s website(s) will not be used for cryptocurrency mining, render farming, committing or promoting any type of illegal activity including, but not limited to, fraud, mailbombing, denial of service attacks, storing and/or housing and/or linking to illegal content, including but not limited to, “warez,” “hacking”/”cracking”/”key generators,” gambling, obscene material or be used in the traffic of illegal materials.

Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all of Customer Content or User Content that is submitted through an Account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.
Customer shall be solely responsible and will be held liable for incorrect setting of netmasks, routes, or any other network configuration or programming issue which causes unnecessary broadcast or multicast traffic on Company’s network, or denial of service, deliberate or not, caused by forging address resolution protocol (“ARP”) queries or replies or by configuring internet protocol addresses into Customer’s hardware which were not assigned to Customer’s Account. The foregoing actions may result in disconnection of the Services. Any loss of functionality of the Account related to the foregoing actions will be and remain the Customer’s sole responsibility. If the foregoing actions are deemed by Company to not warrant an immediate and drastic action, Customer will be contacted.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company may immediately take corrective action, including removal of all or a portion of the Customer Content, disconnection or discontinuance of any and all Services, or termination of this Agreement. In the event Company takes corrective action due to a violation of this Agreement or the AUP, Company shall not refund to Customer any fees paid in advance of such corrective action. Customer hereby agrees that Company shall have no liability to Customer or any of Customer’s customers due to any corrective action that Company may take (including, without limitation, disconnection of the Services).
Customer’s Responsibilities.
Customer is solely responsible for the quality, performance, and all other aspects of the Customer Content and the goods or services provided through the Services.
Customer will cooperate fully with Company in connection with Company’s performance of the Services. Customer must provide any equipment or software that may be necessary for Customer to use the Services. Delays in Customer’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement will extend the time for Company’s performance of its obligations that depend on Customer’s performance on a day for day basis.
Customer assumes full responsibility for providing any of its end users with any required disclosure or explanation of the various features related to Customer Content and any goods or services described therein, as well as any rules, terms or conditions of use.
Because the Services permit Customer to electronically transmit or upload content, Customer shall be fully responsible for uploading all content and supplementing, modifying and updating the Customer Content, including all back-ups. Customer is also responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content and all aspects of the Customer Content are compatible with the hardware and software used by Company to provide the Services, as the same may be changed by Company from time to time. Specifications for the hardware and software used by Company to provide the Services will be available on Company’s Site. Company shall not be responsible for any damages to the Customer Content or other damages or any malfunctions or service interruptions caused by any failure of the Customer Content or any aspect of the Customer Content to be compatible with the hardware and software used by Company to provide the Services.
CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING BACK-UP COPIES OF ALL CUSTOMER CONTENT.
Data Protection.
The Services may involve the submission, collection and/or use of personally identifying or identifiable information about Users, Customer and Customer own customers (“Data”) in the course of Customer use of these Services (“Covered Services”). The Data, for the purpose of this Section, excludes any User Content. Company’s Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), which is hereby incorporated by reference and applicable to Covered Services, is meant to provide Customer contractual assurance that Company has robust mechanisms to ensure the transfer of Customer Data, including transfers of Customer Data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the Covered Services, meets with compliance under applicable data privacy laws. The DPA can be viewed on the Company website.
For the purposes of the DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses attached to the DPA (when and as applicable), Customer (and Customer applicable affiliates) are considered the Data Controller/Data Exporter (as such terms are defined in the DPA), and Customer acceptance of the terms of service governing Covered Services at the time of purchase of any Covered Services will also be treated as Customer acknowledgment and acceptance of the DPA and its appendices (including the Standard Contractual Clauses and its appendices, as applicable). If Customer wishes to print, sign and return a physical copy of the DPA, please send an email request to privacy@inmotionhosting.com.
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) Company has made clear the opt-out procedure for sharing of personal data, implemented security measures to safeguard the personal data that we do keep, minimized the data collected to that which is relevant to the operation of our business and the customer’s site, made available the data collected in an easily accessible way to the customers to whom it belongs, as well as provide an easy method by which they can request that their personal data be purged from our system. Company’s GDPR information can be located on the Company website.
Customer’s Representations and Warranties.
Customer hereby represents and warrants to Company, and agrees that during the Initial/Introductory Term and any Term (as such terms are defined herein) thereafter Customer will ensure that:
Customer is the owner or valid licensee of the Customer Content and each element thereof, and Customer has secured all necessary licenses, consents, permissions, waivers and releases for the use of the Customer Content and each element thereof, including without limitation, all trademarks, logos, names and likenesses contained therein, without any obligation by Company to pay any fees, residuals, guild payments or other compensation of any kind to any Person;
Customer’s use, publication, and display of the Customer Content will not infringe any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any person, or constitute a defamation, invasion of privacy or violation of any right of publicity or any other right of any person, including, without limitation, any contractual, statutory or common law right or any “moral right” or similar right however denominated;
Customer will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding the Customer Content and will use the Customer Content only for lawful purposes; and
Customer has used its best efforts to ensure that the Customer Content is and will at all times remain free of all computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other malicious code.
Customer shall be solely responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of Customer Content, online store and electronic commerce activities, for all products and services offered by Customer or appearing online and for all contents and materials appearing online or on Customer’s products, including, without limitation: the accuracy and appropriateness of the Customer Content and content and material appearing in its store or on its products; ensuring that the Customer Content and content and materials appearing in its store or on its products do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any person; and ensuring that the Customer Content and the content and materials appearing in its store or on its products are not defamatory or otherwise illegal. Customer shall be solely responsible for accepting, processing, and filling customer orders and for handling customer inquiries or complaints. Customer shall be solely responsible for the payment or satisfaction of any and all taxes associated with its web site and online store.
Customer grants Company the right to reproduce, copy, use, and distribute all and any portion of the Customer Content to the extent needed to provide and operate the Services.
In addition to transactions entered into by Customer on Customer’s behalf, Customer also agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement for transactions entered into on Customer’s behalf by anyone acting as Customer’s agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses Customer’s account, whether or not the transactions were on Customer’s behalf.
License to Company. Customer hereby grants to Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license during the Initial Term and any Term thereafter to do the following to the extent necessary in the performance of the Services:
digitize, convert, install, upload, select, order, arrange, compile, combine, synchronize, use, reproduce, store, process, retrieve, transmit, distribute, publish, publicly display, publicly perform and hyperlink the Customer Content;
make archival or back-up copies of the Customer Content (although Company is not required to do so; Customer is solely responsible for backing-up any Customer Content);
except for the rights expressly granted above, Company is not acquiring any right, title or interest in or to the Customer Content, all of which shall remain solely with Customer; and
Company, in its sole discretion, reserves the right (i) to deny, cancel, suspend, transfer or alter, modify, correct, amend, change, program, or take any other corrective action to protect the integrity and stability of the Services (including altering, modifying, correcting, amending, changing, programming, or taking any other corrective action regarding any malicious code, software or related abusive activity, Customer Content and/or web site(s)), and/or (ii) to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, or requirements, requests of law enforcement, or to avoid any liability, civil or criminal. Customer further agrees that Company shall not be liable to Customer for any loss or damages that may result from such conduct.
Billing and Payment.
Customer shall pay to Company any fees for the Services in the manner set forth in the Order Form.
Any Service fees do not include any applicable sales, use, revenue, excise or other taxes imposed by any taxing authority with respect to the Services or any software provided hereunder (excluding any tax on Company’s net income). All such taxes will be added to Company’s invoices for the fees as separate charges to be paid by Customer. All fees are fully earned when due and subject to Company’s refund policy, when paid to Company.
Unless otherwise specified, all fees and related charges shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If any invoice is not paid within seven (7) days after the date of the invoice, Company may charge Customer a late fee of $15.00 for; in addition any amounts payable to Company not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.
If Company collects any payment due at law or through an attorney at law or under advice therefrom or through a collection agency, or if Company prevails in any action to which the Customer and Company are parties, Customer will pay all costs of collection, arbitration and litigation, including, without limitation, all court costs and Company’s reasonable attorneys’ fees.
If any check is returned for insufficient funds Company may impose a minimum processing charge of $25.00.
In the event that any amount due to Company remains unpaid seven (7) days after such payment is due, Company, in its sole discretion, may immediately terminate this Agreement, and/or withhold or suspend Services.
A minimum charge of $50.00 to reinstate accounts that have been suspended or terminated.
Wire transfers will be assessed a minimum $35.00 charge.
A minimum charge of $35.00 for all credit card chargebacks will be assessed.
Autorenewal
Other than as required by applicable law, Company does not retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to Customer payment or usage of Company automatic renewal services, and Company are therefore unable to provide any such document upon request.
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMER DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, THE SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. EXCEPT FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THIS SECTION, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL RENEWS THE APPLICABLE SERVICE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD.
UNLESS CUSTOMER DISABLES THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL AND WILL TAKE PAYMENT FROM ANY PAYMENT METHOD CUSTOMER HAVE ON FILE WITH COMPANY AT COMPANY’S THEN CURRENT RATES, WHICH CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD. IN ORDER TO SEE THE RENEWAL SETTINGS APPLICABLE TO CUSTOMER AND THE SERVICES, CUSTOMER WILL NEED TO LOG INTO THE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT WANT ANY SERVICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, CUSTOMER MAY ELECT TO CANCEL RENEWAL, IN WHICH CASE, THE SERVICES WILL TERMINATE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, UNLESS CUSTOMER MANUALLY RENEWS THE SERVICES PRIOR TO THAT DATE (IN WHICH CASE THE SERVICES WILL AGAIN BE SET TO AUTOMATIC RENEWAL). FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, SHOULD CUSTOMER ELECT TO CANCEL CUSTOMER PRODUCT AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW THE SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, CUSTOMER MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL RENEWAL OF A CUSTOMER DOMAIN NAME AND/OR SECURED SOCKET LEVEL (“SSL”) REGISTRATION, COMPANY MAY PROCESS THE RENEWAL CHARGES UP TO TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER’S EXPIRATION DATE UNLESS CUSTOMER EXPLICITLY REQUESTS IN WRITING OTHERWISE.
COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON CUSTOMER BANK’S PARTICIPATION). IF COMPANY ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE CUSTOMER EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR CUSTOMER BANK) MAY NOTIFY COMPANY OF UPDATES TO CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE CUSTOMER NEW CREDIT CARD ON COMPANY BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO COMPANY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT COMPANY ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE CUSTOMER PAYMENT PROFILE ON CUSTOMER BEHALF. COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT COMPANY WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS CUSTOMER SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMER ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) CANCELLING THE SERVICES AND (II) ENSURING CUSTOMER ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID. FURTHER, CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT CUSTOMER FAILURE TO DO SO, MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICES, AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
If for any reason Company is unable to charge Customer payment method for the full amount owed, or if Company receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to Customer payment method, Customer agrees that Company may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation of the Services, without notice to Customer. Company also reserves the right to charge Customer reasonable “administrative fees” for (i) tasks Company may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Company may incur in providing the Services, and/or (iii) Customer noncompliance with these TOS (as determined by Company in its sole and absolute discretion), which typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (a) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (b) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of the Services, incurred by Company as the results of chargebacks, reversals, payment disputes, penalties or other payment disputes brought by Customer, Customer bank or Customer payment method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the payment method Customer has on file with Company.
Company may offer a Service pricing in various currencies. The transaction(s) will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment. For certain payment methods, the issuer of Customer payment method may charge Customer a foreign transaction fee or other charge(s), which may be added to the final amount that appears on Customer bank statement or post as a separate amount. Please check with the issuer of Customer payment method for details. In addition, regardless of the selected currency, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer may be charged Value Added Tax (“VAT”), Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on Customer bank and/or the country indicated in Customer billing address section.
Customer Conduct. Company will protect the health, safety, and welfare of our employees. Unprofessional conduct, threats, abusive language (including, but not limited to, disparaging remarks regarding the sex, race, religion, or sexual orientation of our employees) and/or anything that could be considered hate speech in the course of Customer communications with Company will not be tolerated. Persistence in these behaviors throughout the Contact can and may result in the termination of that communication. Repeated offenses over multiple contacts may lead to the termination of Customer account without refund as determined by Company’s sole discretion.
Company as Reseller or Licensor. Company may act only as a reseller or licensor of the hardware, software, and equipment used in connection with the products and/or Services that were or are manufactured or provided by a third party (“Non-Company Product”). Company shall not be responsible for any changes in the Services that cause the Non-Company Product to become obsolete, require modification or alteration, or otherwise affect the performance of the Services. Any malfunction or manufacturer’s defects of Non-Company Product either sold, licensed or provided by Company to Customer or purchased directly by Customer used in connection with the Services will not be deemed a breach of Company’s obligations under this Agreement. Any rights or remedies Customer may have regarding the ownership, licensing, performance or compliance of Non-Company Product are limited to those rights extended to Customer by the manufacturer of such Non-Company Product. Customer is entitled to use any Non-Company Product supplied by Company only in connection with Customer’s permitted use of the Services. Customer shall use its best efforts to protect and keep confidential all intellectual property provided by Company to Customer through any Non-Company Product and shall make no attempt to copy, alter, reverse engineer, or tamper with such intellectual property or to use it other than in connection with the Services. Customer shall not resell, transfer, export or re-export any Non-Company Product, or any technical data derived therefrom, in violation of any applicable United States or foreign law.
Internet Protocol (IP) Address Ownership. If Company assigns Customer an Internet Protocol (“IP”) address for Customer’s use, the right to use that IP address shall belong only to Company, and Customer shall have no right to use that IP address except as permitted by Company in its sole and absolute discretion in connection with the Services, during the term of this Agreement. At all times, Company shall own and control ownership of all Internet Protocol numbers and addresses that may be assigned to Customer by Company, and Company reserves the right to change or remove any and all such Internet Protocol numbers and addresses, in its sole and absolute discretion. Any IP numbers which remain unused after a 30-day period will be subject to reassignment by Company, as determined in its sole discretion. In such event, no prior notice will be given to Customer; however, Company may email Customer to inform of the action taken. Any services performed and/or costs incurred in reclaiming any unused IP numbers which have been registered as nameservers will be billed to Customer at Company’s then current administrative services rates.
Caching. Customer expressly grants to Company a license to cache the entirety of the Customer Content, including content supplied by Users or to third parties, and agrees that such caching is not an infringement of any of Customer, User or third party’s intellectual property rights.
CPU Usage. Customer agrees that Customer shall not use excessive amounts, as defined by Company, of CPU processing on any of Company’s servers. Any violation of this policy may result in corrective action by Company, including assessment of additional charges, disconnection or discontinuance of any and all Services, or termination of this Agreement, which actions may be taken in Company’s sole and absolute discretion. If Company takes any corrective action under this section, Customer shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid in advance prior to such action.
Bandwidth and Disk Usage. Company shall provide Customer with a large volume of bandwidth, disk space, and other resources as defined in the Service offering. The Services are intended for reasonable, as determined by the Company, business use only. Any activity that results in excessive usage inconsistent with reasonable usage patterns is strictly prohibited. Customer agrees that such bandwidth and disk usage shall not exceed the amounts set by Company for the Services (the “Agreed Usage”). These allotments are optimized and dedicated towards serving the Customer Content. Customer shall not use any bandwidth and/or disk usage for materials other than the Customer Content. Company will monitor Customer’s bandwidth and disk usage. Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to take any corrective action if Customer’s bandwidth or disk usage exceeds the Agreed Usage or other improper storage or usage. Such corrective action may include the assessment of additional charges, disconnection or discontinuance of any and all Services, removal or deletion of Customer Content and/or other materials or termination of this Agreement, which actions may be taken in Company’s sole and absolute discretion. If Company takes any such corrective action under this section, Customer shall not be entitled to a refund or credit of any fees paid prior to such action. Customer will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding Customer Content.
Property Rights.
Company hereby grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license, exercisable solely during the term of this Agreement, to use Company technology, products and services solely for the purpose of accessing and using the Services. Customer may not use Company’s technology for any purpose other than accessing and using the Services. Except for the rights expressly granted above, this Agreement does not transfer from Company to Customer any Company technology, all rights, titles, and interests in, and to any Company technology, shall remain solely with Company. Customer shall not, directly or indirectly, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code or other trade secrets from any of the Company.
Company owns all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Company’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, inventions, copyrights, trade secrets, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights relating to the design, function, marketing, promotion, sale and provision of the Services and the related hardware, software and systems (“Marks”). Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a license to Customer to use or resell the Marks.
Company’s “Web Interface” and “C-Panel” are proprietary to Company. Although Company does not protect either with compilation nor encryption, each is protected under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other laws. Customer shall not modify or distribute such proprietary materials in any fashion unless authorized in writing by Company. Under no circumstances will Company allow Customer to make any changes to any copyright notice and/or disclaimers related thereto. Requests for modification(s), including translating into other languages, addition of links or advertising, changes to menus, or customer-specific options, must be sent to the Company’s Legal Department via the methods found at Company’s Website. All such requests are subject to an approval process by Company. Changes for the benefit of a single customer which would cause more than one concurrent version of the software will not be considered.
Term; Termination; Cancellation Policy.
The initial/introductory term of this Agreement shall be as set forth in the Order Form or when you signed up for the Services (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term shall begin upon commencement of the Services. After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew. The Initial Term and all successive renewal periods shall be referred to, collectively, as the “Term.”
AFTER THE INITIAL TERM, CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND AUTHORIZES COMPANY TO AUTOMATICALLY BILL AND/OR CHARGE ON CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD FOR SUCCESSIVE TERMS OF EQUAL LENGTH AS THE INITIAL TERM, UNLESS TERMINATED OR CANCELLED BY EITHER PARTY AS PROVIDED HEREIN. REFER TO SECTION 9, BILLING AND PAYMENT, FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.
This Agreement may be cancelled by Customer upon proper notice to Company, prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Term thereafter. Customer will be subject to a minimum $50.00 charge as an early cancellation fee. If Customer cancels this Agreement, no refund will be provided for unused time on the Account if outside the criteria of the Money Back Guarantee. Customer shall be obligated to pay one hundred percent (100%) of all charges for all Services for each month remaining in the Term. Customer shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the date of such cancellation.
