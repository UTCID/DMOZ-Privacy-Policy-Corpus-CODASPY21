This is typically refered to as "try-before-you-buy".While evaluation versions are copyrighted, and the copyright holder retains all rights, the author specifically grants a user the right to freely evaluate and distribute the program, with limited exceptions outlined in the License Agreement included with every IceWarp Server installation.After using an evaluation version for a defined trial period, the user must purchase a licensed copy or remove the evaluation version from their system.Refund PolicyIceWarp makes every effort to ensure that you are 100% certain that IceWarp Server and all related products meet your requirements exactly before you purchase the software.IceWarp Server and all related add-ons are available for a free 30-day trial. All software is unlimited use for this time period for up to 200 users accounts and is not otherwise limited in any way.Additionally, to ensure that you are certain IceWarp Server is the right product for you, you can receive free web-based support related to technical problems during your trial period as well as free pre-sales support via our "Sales Chat" related to functionality, licensing and purchase questions.The advantage of our try-before-you-buy strategy over normal store-bought software is that you can try all versions of IceWarp Server software before you buy it with no limitations on functionality.

If for some reason IceWarp Server software does not meet your requirements, you are under no obligation to purchase and you simply remove it from your computer using the included un-install.As opposed to store-bought software that cannot be tested or returned after the box is open, IceWarp Server software can be fully tested for 14 days with no obligation to purchase.So feel free to try out our software free of charge and our web-based support free of charge.IceWarp Server doesn't need to be reinstalled or reconfigured after registering the full license, all features ordered will be immediately available for the licensed term. (This does NOT limit you to running IceWarp on the machine that it was licensed on. It can be easily migrated.)Once we have released your license to you we cannot control the destiny of that license as there is no physical product to return to us. Thus we cannot accept refunds for licenses that have already been delivered to the customer either via email, fax, phone or mail.We make every effort to ensure that you are 100% confident that IceWarp Server is the right product for you prior to purchase. The fully functional (200 users) 30-day trial, to free web-based technical support and free pre-sales support works well for us and works very well for our customers.
