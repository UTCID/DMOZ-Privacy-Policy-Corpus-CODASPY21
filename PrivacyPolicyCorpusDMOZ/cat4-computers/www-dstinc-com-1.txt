For example, we may aggregate Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.

In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
3. HOW IS DATA COLLECTED?

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
8. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Residents of California
Under certain circumstances, you have the right to:
Request disclosure of what personal information the business collects uses, discloses or sells.
Request deletion of personal information collected or maintained by us. You must make this type of request through the webform on www.dstinc.com.  We will ask you to verify that you have requested deletion of all or certain personal information.
Non-discrimination. Your exercise of privacy rights conferred under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) will not result in discriminatory treatment.
Use an authorized agent. California law allows you to use an authorized agent to make a request under CCPA on your behalf.  You must provide us with written documentation that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf or a power of attorney.  We may also contact your directly to verify your identity.
NOTICE TO CA RESIDENTS:  Where we receive valuable consideration for the provision of personal data to third parties, we do so as a service provider for a third party.  We do not sell information that identifies a person to other businesses. We have not sold personal information, as those terms are defined in the CCPA, within the last twelve months.
RESIDENTS OF NEVADA
Nevada residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personally identifiable information.  While we do not intend to sell personal information, Nevada customers have the legal right to opt out even if their information is not currently being sold.  Use the webform on www.dstinc.com to make a request.
APPLICABLE TO THE European Union
Under certain circumstances, you have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
NOTICE RE: INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS:  Personal Data may be transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, Mexico and India for processing.
Other Jurisdictions
You may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Contact us for more information.
RIGHTS REQUESTS
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us via the webform provided on www.dstinc.com or through the contact information set out above.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  If your request provides and email address or our records contain your email address, we may ask you to verify your identify through such address.  Where additional information is required, we try to ask only information that can be corroborated through our records.  We may also ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within forty-five days (or thirty days for residents in the EU).  Occasionally it may take us longer. If so, we will notify you and keep you updated.  If we deny your request, we will explain the basis for such denial.  We will keep a record of rights requests and responses for at least twenty-four months in a log that will not be used for any purpose other than for record-keeping and analytics.
