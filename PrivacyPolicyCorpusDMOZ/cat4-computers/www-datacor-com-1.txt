Privacy Policy
Get in Touch
Datacor, Inc. (“Datacor,” “we,” “us” and “our”) respects individual privacy and values the confidence of our customers and potential customers. This Privacy Policy sets out the privacy principles that we follow with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide through any of Datacor’s website, software or services which reference this Privacy Policy. Please read this entire Privacy Policy before using Datacor’s website or submitting information to Datacor through this website. By using the Datacor website, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us by any of the methods described below. If you do not agree with our policies, do not use the Datacor website or provide Datacor with your information.
Collected Information
It is Datacor’s general policy not to collect user’s personal information from the website. However, when users use Datacor’s software, subscribe to Datacor publications, or otherwise contact Datacor by email or the website’s designated contact section, in order for Datacor to respond, users may be asked to provide personal information from which you can be identified, such as your name, date of birth, postal and e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information. Datacor only collects personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit to Datacor.
When you terminate your contract with Datacor, or Datacor website account access, Datacor may continue to share information about you according to our legal and regulatory requirements. We will use the information you provide us solely for the purpose of providing you with information that Datacor believes may be of interest to you, providing you with information and materials you have requested, administering our relationship with you, and for internal business purposes such as Datacor research and development projects.
Sharing and Disclosing Information
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.
Datacor may also use this information for performing marketing studies, research projects, or for other commercial purposes for which it may receive compensation. If Datacor collects credit card information through this website, such information will be used to fill your order but Datacor will not share your personal payment information with third parties without your consent. Datacor may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal a website user’s identity or confidential information. We do not otherwise sell your personal information to, or share such personal information with, third parties for their promotional use or for marketing purposes. Third parties refer to any entity not within the Datacor organization structure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Datacor may disclose your personal information as required by law or as needed in legal proceedings when Datacor believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a third party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by Datacor will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.
Providing Us With Information About Others
If you provide us with personal information about someone else, you are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any obligation and consent obligations under applicable data protection laws in relation to such disclosure. Insofar as required by applicable data protection laws, you must ensure that you have provided the required notices and have obtained the individual’s explicit consent or otherwise have a legal basis to provide us with the information and that you explain to them how we collect, use, disclose, and retain their personal information or direct them to read our Privacy Policy.
Security Measures
This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Datacor’s control. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) as part of the enrollment process, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
When you submit information to Datacor through our website, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information.
