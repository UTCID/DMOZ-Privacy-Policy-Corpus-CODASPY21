5. GDPR Rights
The GDPR is a comprehensive EU data privacy law that went into effect on May 25, 2018. This regulation states that everyone in the EU has a right to protection of their personal data, and applies to all companies who collect and process data for EU residents. Rights under the GDPR include:
The right to access the personal data the organization is processing, as well as to receive information about the particulars of the processing activities;
The right of an individual in the EU to have the personal data concerning him or her be corrected or updated;
The “Right to Erasure,” sometimes called the “Right to be Forgotten,” which enables individuals in the EU to require the deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances “without undue delay.” Circumstances that may trigger this right include the data’s retention becoming no longer necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected;
The right to withdraw a previously given consent to the use of personal data;
The “Right to Object” to use of an individual’s personal data for some types of “profiling” or automated decision making. This includes the right to be informed if the data subject’s information will be used for automated decision making or profiling;
The “Right to Portability” in certain circumstances, which includes the right to get a copy of stored personal data an individual has provided and to transfer the data, unimpeded, to another organization;
The right to complain to a local data protection authority in the EU if a data subject believes that his or her data is being unlawfully processed.
