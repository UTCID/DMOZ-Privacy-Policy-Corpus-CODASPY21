Screen Share Terms of Use
You have requested the assistance of a Netfirms employee or consultant to provide you
with technical support through remote screen sharing connection to your computer. You
understand and agree that by requesting such assistance, you will be providing a
Netfirms employee or consultant with access to view information contained on your
computer screen. You will be providing the employee or consultant with this access to
perform only work requested by you and to troubleshoot your issues.
The use of this screen sharing session is in accordance with these terms. By accepting the
screen share session from Netfirms, you are agreeing to give Netfirms "view only"
access to information contained on your computer screen.
Be sure to close any web browser windows with sensitive or confidential information. Should
sensitive information be shared, we advise you to reset any passwords or other sensitive
information that may have been shared upon completion of the screen share session.
Netfirms recommends that you remain seated at your desktop throughout the entire screen
share session. You acknowledge and agree that the screen sharing session may be cut short,
delayed, rescheduled, and/or terminated as a result of matters outside of our reasonable
control.
The screen sharing session is provided at your sole risk and Netfirms will not be liable
to you for any loss, costs, expenses, or damages incurred by you, including but not limited
to any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages.
