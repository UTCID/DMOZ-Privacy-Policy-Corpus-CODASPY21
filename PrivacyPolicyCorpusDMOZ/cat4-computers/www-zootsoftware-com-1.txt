All data accessed in this manner travels directly from those company servers to the user's personal computer.
At no time does any data from these servers travel through any Zoot Software servers.
If you use a cloud storage service like OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox please refer to the privacy policy of that service for additional information about your data and privacy.
