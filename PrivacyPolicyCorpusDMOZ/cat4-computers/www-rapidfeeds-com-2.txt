PRIVACY POLICY
RapidFeeds is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most

keeping your personal information safe.
How we collect and use personal information
Registering for membership on RapidFeeds gives you access to all of the site's services.
The only information required is your name and e-mail address. With your approval, we
occasionally will send e-mail to notify you about important changes to the site, new services,
important upgrades and special offers from us. If you would rather not receive these e-mail
notifications, then please use the instructions on the bottom of the e-mail to unsubscribe.
RapidFeeds uses the best technology around in preserving your personal information,

How we protect your personal information
All personal data you enter on RapidFeeds is secure with the same state-of-the-art security software
we use to guard all of our company's essential business data. In addition to using the most secure
technology available, we work tirelessly to make sure that we use any information you provide us
only in ways you have approved.
How we use "cookies"
As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your
computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, RapidFeeds uses cookies to
identify members so they dont have to enter a user ID and password upon each visit. You can select
the "remember my password" option, which remembers your password for up to 2 weeks. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject
cookies on a case-by-case basis. Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the
features on our site by logging in manually with each visit.
Obtaining your consent
By using our Web site, you give RapidFeeds permission to collect information about the
pages served to you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics.
If you register at RapidFeeds, you authorize RapidFeeds to use information you provide to personalize
the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate
customer data. As a registered member, you give RapidFeeds permission to send you e-mails related to
our website and partnering sites. RapidFeeds will not sell or rent your email address to anyone without
your consent. If you are under the age of 13 you must not provide your name, e-mail address, or any other
identifying information without the consent of your parent or guardian, or as otherwise provided for by
applicable law. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
