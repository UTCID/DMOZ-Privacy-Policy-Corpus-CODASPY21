3.1.1  Products and Services where the price is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market, and cannot be controlled by Cadline and which may occur within the cancellation period;
3.1.2  the supply of Bespoke Products or other Products made to the Client’s specification or are clearly personalised;

3.1.8  Products that become mixed inseparably (according to their nature) with other items after delivery.
3.2  Where the Regulations apply, the Client is entitled to cancel these Terms if the Client so wishes, provided that the Client exercises the right to cancel no longer than 14 days after:
3.2.1   the day on which the Client acquires or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by the Client acquires physical possession of the Products; or
3.2.2  in the case of a contract relating to multiple Products ordered by the Client in one order and delivered separately, the day on which the Client acquires or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by the Client acquires physical possession of the last Product; or
3.2.3  in the case of a contract relating to delivery of Products consisting of multiple lots or pieces, the day on which the Client acquires or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by the Client acquires physical possession of the last lot or piece; or
3.2.4  in the case of a contract for regular delivery of Products during a defined period of time, the day on which the Client acquires or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by the Client acquires physical possession of the first Product; or

3.3  To cancel under this clause 3, the Client must inform Cadline of their decision to cancel by a clear statement (for example, a letter sent by registered post to: Sales at Cadline Limited, Cadline House, Drake Avenue, Staines-upon-Thames, Middlesex, TW18 2AP, fax to: 01784 252555 or email to: sales.support@cadline.co.uk). The Client can use the model cancellation form set out in Schedule 1 of these Terms but it is not obligatory.
3.4  In the event the Client wishes to exercise their right of cancellation under the terms of this clause 3, the Client must retain possession of the Products and take reasonable care of them.
3.5  Unless Cadline has offered to collect the Products or in the case of an Off-premises contract the Products were delivered to the Client’s property when the contract was entered into and could not, by their very nature, normally be returned by post, the Client should return the Products at the Client’s cost within 14 days of such cancellation and Cadline will reimburse the Client (using the method used to pay for the original transaction unless the Client agrees otherwise) the amount in relation to the Products to which the cancellation rights under this clause apply. This includes the cost of delivery, unless the Client expressly chooses a kind of delivery costing more than the least expensive common and generally acceptable kind of delivery offered by Cadline, in which case Cadline is to reimburse the Client for an amount the Client would have paid if the Client chose the least expensive common and generally acceptable kind of delivery offered by Cadline.
3.6  Cadline will make the reimbursement to the Client without undue delay and not later than:
3.6.1   14 days after the day on which it receives back from the Client any Products supplied;
3.6.2  (if earlier) 14 days after the day the Client provides evidence that the Client has returned the Products; or
3.6.3   if no Products were supplied, 14 days after the day on which Cadline is informed about the Client’s decision to cancel this contract
3.7  Cadline has the right to deduct an amount from any refund due to the Client, or request payment from the Client, to reflect the loss in value of any Products supplied as a result of handling of the Products by the Client beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Products.
3.8  If the Client wishes for and instructs Cadline in writing to commence works and/or to supply and/or provide Products and/or Services before the expiry of the relevant cancellation period referred to in this clause 3, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the Client loses their right to cancel once the contract has been performed. If the Services provided by Cadline have not been completed and the Client cancels within the cancellation period, the Client will have to pay for the part of the Services that Cadline has carried out. If Products were supplied with Services, the Client has the right to return the Products if the Client cancelled within the relevant cancellation period but the Client will be liable to pay for some or all of the Services provided.

Failure to comply with this time period will render any potential claim void.
9.3    Once notified in accordance with clause 9.2 of the damage, shortage or fault in specification by the Client, Cadline will at its option:
9.3.1       As soon as reasonably practicable deliver to the Client to the address specified on the Client’s order any shortage of the Products provided that Cadline is satisfied that there is such a shortage of Products; or
