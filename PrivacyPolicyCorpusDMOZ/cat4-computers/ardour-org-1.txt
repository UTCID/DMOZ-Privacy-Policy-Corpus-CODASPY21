Privacy Statement for ardour.org
Who is ardour.org?
ardour.org is a website paid for and administered by Paul Davis,
doing business as Linux Audio Systems, in Galisteo,
New Mexico. The website exists to make the digital audio
workstation software called "Ardour" available to users and
developers, and to share information about the program.
You can always reach Paul via email
at paul@linuxaudiosystems.com,
though general privacy and data protection questions should go to
privacy@ardour.org.
What Information Do We Collect from You?
We collect your email address and the name you provide when you
register with the website (or its sub-sites such as
tracker.ardour.org). If you use our forums, we will also store the
text you provide us for your forum posts. We also keep generalized
web server logs that contain your internet address when using the
website.
If you purchase Ardour from us, we will store information about the
transaction that we are provided by the payment processor. This
includes the email address you gave them.
If you download and use a ready-to-run version of Ardour from
ardour.org, the program will attempt to contact ardour.org at
startup to determine if you should be notified about a new release
of the software. If the computer where you use Ardour is connected
to the internet, this process will store the computer's internet
address and an identifier for its operating system.
If you report a bug to our bug tracker, we will store whatever
information you provide as part of the bug report.
If you are granted access to our Git server, we will store a public
SSH key that you provide us, in order to provide you with access to
the server. If you push commits to our Git server, we will store
those git commits, and will retain these commits in perpetuity
because they are required for the legitimate interests of the Ardour
software project. Analysis of the development history of the
software is a critical task, and altering the history represented by
git commits interferes with that task in a fundamental manner.
How Do We Use Personal Information
We use your personal information only to establish and maintain your
account(s) at ardour.org. In particular, we want to be able to provide
you with software updates without cost, since this an explicit part
of our contract with you when you pay for the software.
If you report a bug to our bug tracker, we may send email
notifications to the email address you provide when the status of
the bug report changes, so that you may remain involved with the
report you created.
We do NOT use your personal data for marketing, to
carry out polls or surveys, or to announce new releases or other
news.
When Do We Privately Share Personal Data?
Never, unless required to by law.
When Do We Publically Share Personal Data?
Never, except for forum posts and bug reports which are inherently
public by their nature.
Where Do We Store and Process Data?
ardour.org runs on the services provided by Amazon Web Services
(AWS), specifically their US East (Virginia) region. Your data is
stored on hardware run by AWS, using virtual computers administered
by us.
How Do We Secure Personal Data?
The data we collect from you is stored on computers with typical
administrative measures in place to prevent unauthorised
access. Two individual persons have authorisation to login to the
computer system involved.
How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data
In general there is no fixed lifetime for your personal information.
Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
You have the right to access a copy of the personal data we have
stored about you. You have the right to request that we delete all
personal data we have stored about you. To exercise these rights,
contact privacy@ardour.org
via email.
For developers only: please note that git commits that you might
have made are considered part of the legitimate interests of the
ardour.org, as a part of the Ardour software project. Our record of
these commits will not be edited or removed under any circumstances,
regardless of any personally identifying information in the body of
your commit or in the commit meta-data.
