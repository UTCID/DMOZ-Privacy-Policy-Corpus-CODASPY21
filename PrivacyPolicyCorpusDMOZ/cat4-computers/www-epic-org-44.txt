President Bush's proposed $2.57 trillion
federal budget for Fiscal Year 2006 greatly increases the
amount of money spent on surveillance technology and programs
while cutting about
150 programs—most of them from the Department of Education.
EPIC's "Spotlight
on Surveillance" project scrutinizes these surveillance programs. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested more
than $2 billion to finance grants to state and local governments for homeland
security needs.1 Some of this money is
being used by state and local governments to create networks of surveillance
cameras to watch over the public in the streets, shopping centers, at airports
and more.2 However, studies have found
that such surveillance systems have little effect on crime, and that it is
more effective to place more officers on the streets and improve lighting
in high-crime areas.3 There are significant
concerns about citizens’ privacy rights and misuse or abuse of the system.
A professor at the University of Nevada at Reno has alleged that the university
used a homeland security camera system to surreptitiously watch him after
he filed a complaint alleging that the university abused its research animals.4 Also,
British studies have found there is a significant danger of racial discrimination
and stereotyping by those monitoring the cameras.5  Previous

Cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and New Orleans have installed camera
surveillance networks with financing from the federal government. Such
cameras, which can $60,000 each, can be remotely controlled by police
to pan, tilt, zoom and rotate; have day and night vision capabilities,
and wireless technologies.6
Chicago has 2,250 cameras in its “Homeland Security Grid,” which
DHS helped finance with a $5.1 million grant, and will be adding
cameras in the next two years with funds from another $48 million grant
from
Homeland Security.7 By 2006, Chicago
will have a 900-mile fiber-optic grid.8 The
cameras are linked to a $43-million operations center constantly monitored
by police officers.9
For more information
about video surveillance,
see EPIC's Observing
Surveillance project.Baltimore has used federal grants to finance its camera system and
$1.3 million “Watch Center.”10 The
cameras are connected to the state’s existing highway monitoring
cameras, and the plan is for five counties in Maryland – Anne Arundel,
Baltimore, Carroll, Hartford and Howard – to connect with the city’s
surveillance system.11
In New Orleans digital camera images are sent to a main server archive
for monitoring, and the Internet-based archive can be accessed from any
location, including police vehicles.12 Cameras
are currently operating in the city, but New Orleans’ extensive 1,000-camera
surveillance system is expected to be fully deployed by the end of the
year.13 Paramus, N.J., is launching
a pilot camera surveillance system at shopping malls that will be partially
financed by federal grants.14
Though cities are spending millions for these systems, studies have
shown that they do not decrease criminal activity. Last year, a Milwaukee
study found that law enforcement officials in cities such as Detroit,
Mich.; Miami, Fla.; and Oakland, Calif., abandoned the use of these surveillance
systems because they had little effect on crime prevention.15
Several American cities looked to Great Britain’s surveillance
system when developing their own. London has 200,000 cameras, and more
than 4 million cameras have been deployed throughout the country.16 It
is estimated that there is one camera for every 14 people.17 The
average Briton is seen by 300 cameras per day, according to estimates.18 However,
several studies have shown that these systems have very little effect
on crime. In 2002, the British Home Office examined 22 camera surveillance
systems in North America and the United Kingdom, and found that such systems
had a small effect on crime.19 It
is more effective to place more officers on the streets and improve lighting
in high-crime areas.20
Studies have also shown that there is a serious risk of race discrimination
with the use of camera surveillance networks. Black males are disproportionately
scrutinized when such cameras systems are used.21 The
National Association for the Criminal Rehabilitation of Offenders found
race discrimination in the systems and stated “[w]hen certain sections
of the community are disproportionately monitored, this not only acts
to portray an impression of criminality amongst these groups (certain
acts are noticed whilst other groups may be carrying out the same acts
unmonitored and unnoticed), it also conveys a message to these individuals
that they are not trusted.”22
There are also concerns that the homeland security camera systems will
be misused or abused. The University of Nevada at Reno installed a network
of 80 surveillance cameras throughout campus grounds and in school buildings
with a $598,000 grant from Homeland Security in 2003.23 Professor
Hussein S. Hussein filed suit after finding that the university used a
homeland security hidden camera to watch his lab after Mr. Hussein had
previously found a hidden university police camera, installed inside a
smoke detector, was being used to monitor his lab.24 The
university admitted installing the hidden camera, but claimed it was investigating
a “potential hate crime.”25
The University of Nevada at Reno is just one of many universities that
are using camera surveillance systems, including the University of Texas
at Austin and the University of Pennsylvania.26 At
the University of Northern Iowa, students protested after Cedar Falls,
Iowa, installed cameras to monitor crowds gathered for Homecoming.27
The list of places installing camera surveillance systems includes smaller
towns. Cicero, Ill., (population: 83,000) plans to install several surveillance
cameras, at a cost of $50,000 each, with a grant from Homeland Security.28 A
federal grant of $150,000 will help Newport, R.I., (population: 86,000)
to pay for the installation of surveillance cameras.29 St.
Bernard Parish, La., (population: 66,000) spent $112,000 in federal funds
for surveillance cameras.30
EPIC has been following the growth in the use of such camera systems
for years. In 2002, EPIC launched the Observing Surveillance project.31 The
project includes a map of camera locations in areas of downtown Washington,
D.C., which indicates both the locations of surveillance cameras installed
by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the projected surveillance
radius of those cameras.
