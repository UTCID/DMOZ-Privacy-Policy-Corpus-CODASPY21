We could bang on about what we will do and won't do with any data we collect in a legalistic and complicated way but basically:
We are registered under the Data Protection Act.
We will do nothing with the data that we collect on this site except store it on our server so that we can keep you up-to-date with information about the company and new products/services.
We will not sell, pass on or otherwise disseminate your data. Cookies may be used on some pages to help navigation but only meaningless user ids and session ids are stored.
If you have any problems or questions please email us.
