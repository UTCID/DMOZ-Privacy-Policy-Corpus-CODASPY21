Lynda.com’s Cookie Policy
Does Lynda.com use cookies?
Yes. Lynda.com uses cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses Lynda.com has the best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Lynda.com features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Lynda.com and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Lynda.com.
What are clear gifs?
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded on Web pages.
What is a Flash cookie?
Local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies”, are similar in function to browser cookies in that they store some information about you or your activities on our Websites. We use Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. The options within your browser may not prevent the setting of Flash cookies. To manage Flash cookies please click here.
When does Lynda.com place cookies?
We use cookies on our Services, including our Websites and App. Any browser visiting our Websites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non- Lynda.com sites that host our content.
What types of cookies does Lynda.com use?
We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Lynda.com or interact with our Services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Lynda.com when you return to one of our Websites or a partner site that uses our Services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).
Which Lynda.com entity is using cookies?
If you reside in the United States, LinkedIn Corporation will be responsible for your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services. If you reside outside the United States, LinkedIn Ireland U.C. will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services.
What are cookies used for?
Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Lynda.com, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that's in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Lynda.com faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Lynda.com sites and bring customized features to you.
What is Do Not Track (DNT)?
DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow and no standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Lynda.com does not generally respond to "do not track" signals.
How are cookies used for advertising purposes?
Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third-party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by Lynda.com may also set third party cookies.
If you are logged in on Lynda.com or browsing a third party partner site of Lynda.com and one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage (such as your browsing behavior) and log data (such as your IP address) will be associated by us with your account. We also use aggregate data from third parties and Lynda.com activity.
If you are a Lynda.com member but logged out of your account on a browser, Lynda.com may still continue to log your interaction with our services on that browser in order to generate usage analytics for our services, which analytics we may share in aggregate form with our advertising customers.
Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:
provide more relevant, interest-based advertising
provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners
improve our Services and other products
We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers unless you have given us permission to do so.
What third-party cookies does Lynda.com use?
Our cookie table lists some of the third party cookies on our sites. Please note that the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, service providers, and other third parties is not covered by our Cookie Policy and we do not have access or control over these cookies.
Controlling cookies
Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
What to do if you don't want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?
If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other device you're using to access our services. If you use Lynda.com without changing your browser settings, we'll assume that you're happy to receive all cookies on Lynda.com Websites. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies, including Lynda.com cookies. Please note that the Lynda.com site will not work properly without cookies.
To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit wikipedia.org, www.allaboutcookies.org, or www.aboutcookies.org. You may exercise control over the use of certain advertising-related cookies by using the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AdChoices program website.
