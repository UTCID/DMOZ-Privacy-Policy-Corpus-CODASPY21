You do not have to accept all of the cookies used by our Websites. When you arrive on each of our Websites, a pop-up window will appear informing you that such Website uses cookies and asking you to first agree to the storage of cookies on your device in order to navigate such Website. Through this pop-up window, you can choose to accept all cookies or customize your cookie settings on such Website.

4. AppGate’s Use of Google Analytics.
Our Websites also use Google Analytics, a third-party web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how their visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics collects information anonymously, and reports web site trends without personally identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. The Google Analytics cookie is used to store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. A different Google Analytics cookie is used for each website that uses the Google Analytics tool, and visitors are not tracked across multiple websites. To disable this type of cookie, some browsers will indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis. In addition to declining cookies, you can also install the Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on in your browser, which prevents Google Analytics from collecting information about your website visits. Information collected by the Google Analytics cookie is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices. To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, please visit: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245. To opt out of Google Analytics, please visit: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
