SHIPPING POLICY
Summary of MetaVR's shipping policy
MetaVR's corporate shipping policy provides for the use of Federal Express (FedEx) exclusively.
All shipments are fully insured to destination. If any portion of a shipment is lost or damaged when it arrives at a customer's receiving dock or upon opening and inspection of the shipment at the customer's receiving facility, MetaVR will replace item(s) at no charge to the customer. Any damage or lost components must be documented by the customer at the time of receipt and sent to MetaVR via email at shipping@metavr.com.
Your order may be delivered in multiple shipments depending on when any one complete line item is ready for shipment. You will automatically receive all tracking information upon shipment and receipt of your orders via email from the FedEx tracking system. Shipments directed to APO/FPO addresses may be delayed. Shipments can not be delivered to a Post Office Box, whether domestic or international.
There are two options for handling shipping charges:
You provide MetaVR with your FedEx account number and we bill the shipment directly to your FedEx account. We will use your Purchase Order number in the reference field so that you can track the shipping costs. Typically, customers of larger companies have lower FedEx rates than MetaVR can obtain.
You prepay a fixed shipping charge, reflected on your Purchase Order; this is MetaVR's estimated shipping charges billed as a fixed firm price. MetaVR will not bill you at a later time for any difference in the actual shipping costs. Our Federal Express billing cycle precludes us from providing receipts for the actual shipping costs and as well, billing for the primary purchase and the shipping charges separately has prohibitive administrative costs.
All orders are shipped Monday through Friday. Sunday delivery is not available. For two-day delivery, two non-holiday business days are required for delivery. For one-day delivery, orders must be received by 12 PM ET.
MetaVR does not bill shipping costs collect (COD.)
MetaVR ships internationally. Please bear in mind that all customs clearing, duties and taxes are not included in the freight calculation and are the responsibility of the customer. Note that shipments that are not retrieved from customs are not covered by MetaVR's insurance. Customer Shipper identification number are required and restrictions may apply.
All policies on this page are subject to change without notice.
