Privacy Policy
Updated: Thursday, July 23, 2009
Philosophy
We are only interested in collecting and retaining the information that is necessary to effectively run our business. We respect your right to keep your personal information private.
IP Addresses & Cookies
High-Logic uses IP addresses and cookies for statistical and system administration purposes. Our Forum uses cookies to keep track of registered members preferences and to provide you with information on posts since your last visit. We do not use this information to track your individual behavior.
Forum Participation
Please note that information you place in your "profile" on the Forum can be viewed by the general public. If you do not wish to make your email address or personal information public, you can still register for the Forum. You should omit any personal information from the "profile" that you don't want seen by the general public. By participating in the Forum, you agree that we may reproduce any of your contributions elsewhere on the website or in our newsletters. However, we will only publish the information that you make public.
E-mail
We will not sell your e-mail address, nor do we provide it to advertisers or mass marketers. In other words, you will never receive junk mail based on information you submit directly to us.
Newsletter (opt-in mailing list)
Information gathered from e-newsletter subscriptions is used to provide you with the e-mails you have requested and to allow us to customize future e-mail and e-newsletter offerings. You may remove yourself from our electronic mailing lists by following the directions included in each e-mail or at this page.
Ordering
In our own customer database we store your name, e-mail address, order details, as well as your address. All our online orders are encrypted, secured, and processed by our online payment procesor so we never receive your credit card information.
