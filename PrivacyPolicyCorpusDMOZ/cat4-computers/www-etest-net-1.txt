Privacy Statement
eTest takes the privacy of its test takers seriously. For our company to continue to grow and be successful, it is important that we earn the respect and trust of the companies using our services and the individuals taking the tests. To that end, we will fully protect and guarantee your privacy, and pledge to neither lend, sell, or make available test results to 3rd parties outside of the client company or the individual test taker.
By taking the test on behalf of a client company, test takers provide implicit permission to share their test results with that company, and that company only.
eTest will not make your test results available to other companies, corporations, individuals, or legal entities unless expressly granted permission by both you and the original client company.
If you have questions about our privacy policies, please contact us at Privacy@eTest.net for clarification.
