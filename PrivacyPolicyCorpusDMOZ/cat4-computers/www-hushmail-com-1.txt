CEO and Founder - GoodTherapy.org
At GoodTherapy.org, we are committed to reducing harm and protecting the best interest of those in therapy and we’re thrilled that Hushmail has developed a service which will enable therapists to more reliably protect the privacy and confidentiality of their clients electronically.
Brenda Fowler, MA, LPC
Marriage and Relationship Counselor - Turnstone Counseling
The more client communication I have, the more I want to make sure I am protecting them and myself. Hushmail has worked well for me as a safe and HIPAA compliant way to share progress notes with my clients so they are able to keep track of our work together.
Gregory N. Essig, PhD
Licensed Counseling Psychologist - Feathergill and Associates
Hushmail is easy to use. Not having had any headaches with Hushmail is huge. There is almost always some when we have had to deal with other companies in other areas of the practice. Hushmail was pretty easy to figure out on my own. Email is such an integral part of our business and having it operate smoothly... you can’t really overstate that.
Brad Fowler, Owner
Construction EMarketing
I am very satisfied with the service that you offer and your customer service is excellent. You do great follow-ups. If I send a tech support ticket it is responded to within a matter of 24 hours. And if I ever need to, I can just pick up the phone and contact you.
Michael J. Vogel, Psy.D.
Licensed Psychologist - Cornerstone Family Counseling
Hushmail is very helpful and necessary in the current era. Some providers assume it is sufficient to use non-secure email with a disclaimer underneath their signature lines. I prefer to know that what I write is HIPAA-compliant, secure and encrypted.
