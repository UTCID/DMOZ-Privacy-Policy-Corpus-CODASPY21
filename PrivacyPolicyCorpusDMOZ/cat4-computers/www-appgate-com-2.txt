Where we transfer EEA/EU/UK/Switzerland Personal Data to Group Affiliates that are not covered by the EU-US or Swiss-U.S., as applicable, Privacy Shield Framework, we will put in place appropriate intra-group agreements in accordance with the GDPR requirements, including use of the EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers as appropriate.

X. Data Retention
We will retain Personal Data that we collect and Process where we have a justifiable business need to do so and/or for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this GDPR Privacy Policy.

For current Customers, badge activity and badge holder profiles stored within our access control system are retained for the duration of the contract and for up to 12 months thereafter. Such information may be retained for longer if it is included in other types of records that are subject to a longer retention period.
When, in our reasonable discretion, we have no justifiable business need to Process your Personal Data (for example, after all of our necessary interactions have ended, our internal record keeping policies no longer require us to continue to Process your Personal Data, and we have no other legal obligations to retain your Personal Data), we will either delete it or anonymize it.

Individuals may contact us, at the address provided in the Section IV captioned “Our Contact Details” above to exercise any of those rights and we will respond with the requested action or information, or will let you know why such rights do not apply to you.
These rights are not absolute and are subject to various conditions under applicable data protection and privacy legislation and the laws and regulations to which we are subject.
In some cases, the exercise of these rights (for example, erasure, objection, restriction or the withholding or withdrawing of consent to processing) may make it impossible for us to achieve the purposes identified in Section V or VI, as applicable, of this GDPR Privacy Policy and otherwise provide services.
A. Right Not to Provide Consent or to Withdraw Consent. We may seek to rely on your consent in order to Process certain Personal Data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of the Processing conducted based on consent before its withdrawal.

C. Right of Rectification. You have the right to require that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data concerning you, and that we complete incomplete Personal Data.
D. Right of Erasure. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase Personal Data concerning you; for example, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected and we do not otherwise have a legitimate reason to retain it.
We may need to retain certain Personal Data when legally required, for internal, record keeping purposes, and/or in order to complete any transactions initiated prior to an individual’s request to remove or delete their Personal Data. Where we are unable to delete data from our systems, we will anonymize it so it will no longer be tied to your identity.
E. Right to Restrict Processing. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the Processing of the Personal Data that we have collected about you; for example, where you believe that the Personal Data that we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held.
F. Right to Data Portability. In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, and for us to transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we stop Processing your Personal Data, including where we rely on legitimate interests as legal basis in the tables on the details of Processing provided above. If you receive commercial electronic communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the receipt of future commercial electronic communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided in such communications. Please also note that if you do opt out of receiving commercial electronic communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages (such as updates about your account or changes in the Services), and you cannot opt out from receiving these messages, unless you stop receiving our Services.
H. Right Not to be Subject to Decisions Based Solely on Automated Processing that Produce Legal Effects. We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing - including profiling - that produces legal effects or similarly affects you.
I. Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority if you believe that our Processing of Personal Data relating to you is inconsistent with our obligations under the GDPR. In this situation, we ask you please consider contacting us first, so that we can try and assist with your query or address your concern.
To exercise any of your rights as set forth herein, please contact us in writing, via email or postal mail as indicated in Section IV “Our Contact Details” above, so that we may consider your request under applicable law. We may ask that you provide the following Personal Data for us to address your request speedily:

In addition, please note that, depending on the nature of your inquiry, request, or complaint, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request and may require proof of identity, such as in the form of a government issued ID and proof of your physical address. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case within the timelines prescribed by applicable laws. However, we reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example because it is repetitive) and/or, in some cases, to charge a fee that takes into account the administrative costs for providing the information or the communication or taking the action requested.
