RightFax® Support Policy Changes

New Support Policy Changes From RightFax®.
RightFax® Support Contracts renew every year. It is very important that you are aware of the latest changes in policies that affect your renewal.
RightFax® has made certain changes to RightFax® Support Renewals that you must be made aware of. These policies are effective immediately. Here is what you NEED TO KNOW:
Decommission Policy: If there are any supported components of your current RightFax® environment (modules, channels, hardware, etc.) that you NO LONGER plan to use and/or support, you must ‘decommission’ those products at least 90 days before your contract expiration date. If these products are not decommissioned at least 90 days prior to your contract expiring, you will be charged for another full year of support on these products. Please contact Ingenium as soon as you wish to decommission products so we can help you.
Late Fees: It is critical that you renew your support contract on time. RightFax® imposes a 3% late-penalty (of the total cost of your renewal) that begins the day after a Support Contract expires, and an additional 3% every 30 days a contract remains expired. Please renew your contract with before it expires to avoid these costly penalties!
You can avoid costly penalties by taking a few proactive steps now. You can count on Ingenium to help you renew your support agreement prior to the expiration date. DO NOT WAIT when needing to decommission a product or renewing your support. We will work with you to make this process as smooth as possible.
If you have any questions, please call us at 770-936-0600 or reach out to your Ingenium Account Manager.
