At SautinSoft, we respect your privacy. We will not sell, share,
or rent any data collected on our site to others.
Cookies
We don't use cookies.
OrdersWhen ordering a product from us, the purchaser's
name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number,
and expiration date are encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket
Layers) and passed through to the credit card processing company.
This is necessary for processing and fulfilling orders and
providing notification of the order status. If you don't wish
to disclose your credit card number, feel free to order by
mail using a check. You can also pay by international wire
transfer, in which case we will know only the account holder
name and the e-mail address to which we should e-mail the
registration codes.
Software
The software distributed on our site doesn't collect any personal
information or send any information to our servers. We don't
and never will distribute spyware.
Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing
a friend about our site, we ask the user for their name and
the friend's e-mail address. We will automatically send the
friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site.
The friend's e-mail address is used for the sole purpose of
sending this one-time e-mail, and is stored in the log files
to prevent abuse of this service. The log files are deleted
on a monthly basis.
Server Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally
identifiable information. The log files are deleted on a monthly
basis.
