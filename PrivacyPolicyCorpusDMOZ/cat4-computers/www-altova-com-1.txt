H.	POSTED MATERIALS.
Altova does not claim ownership of the materials you provide to Altova or post, upload, share, input or submit to any Services for review by anyone (each a "Submission" and collectively "Submissions"). However, by posting, uploading, sharing, inputting, providing or submitting ("Posting") your Submission you are granting Altova, its affiliated companies and necessary sublicensees permission to use your Submission in connection with the operation of their Internet businesses (including without limitation all Services), including without limitation the license rights to: copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your Submission; to publish your name in connection with your Submission; and to sublicense such rights to any supplier of the Services.
By Posting a Submission you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission, including without limitation all rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, share, input or submit the Submissions. No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission, as provided herein. Altova is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide, and Altova may remove any Submission at any time in its sole discretion.
In addition, by Posting a Submission that contains images, photographs, pictures or that is otherwise graphical in whole or in part ("Images"), you warrant and represent that (a) you are the copyright owner of such Images, or the copyright owner has granted you permission to use such Images or any content and/or images contained in such Images consistent with the manner and purpose of your use and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Use and the Services, (b) you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Use, and (c) any person depicted in such Images has provided consent to the use of the Images as set forth in these Terms of Use, including without limitation the distribution, public display and reproduction of such Images.

No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Images.
If you object to a Submission, you may “flag” or “report” the Submission to Altova by clicking the icon indicating same. You will then be prompted to state the good faith reason for the objection and provide sufficient information for Altova to contact you to request additional information, if applicable. Additionally, you may use the DMCA Take Down Procedure discussed below.
Altova permits users to post hypertext links to content hosted and maintained by third parties. Although linked sites are not generally reviewed by Altova’s moderators, links are subject to treatment like any other type of content posted to the Forums. You may not include a link in the Forums that directs users to any content or information that, if posted in the Forums, would constitute a violation of these terms. Viewing any linked site, including those controlled by Altova, is at your own risk. You should use your own judgment before you use any link or access any linked site. When leaving the Forums using a link provided by a user, you should be aware that Altova’s terms and policies no longer govern, and, therefore, you should review the applicable terms and policies of that site. If you access a linked site and find that material to be in violation of these terms, you may report the link as described below. Altova makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, the quality, content, nature or reliability of sites accessible by hypertext link from the Forums.
We encourage you to use caution and not reveal information that you do not want to make public in your postings. Any personal information that you post can be obtained and used by others. Anything you post in the Forums you post at your own risk. You use the Forums at your own risk. In any online forum like Forums, it is not possible to be sure that other users are who they say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated.
I.	REGISTRATION FOR FORUMS.
You are not obligated to register in order to access the Forums and read the message boards. However, registration (via provision of a valid email address, user name and password) and login are required in order to post to the message boards, share Content and adjust user settings. Altova will handle all information received from you in accordance with the Altova Privacy Policy and Altova Cookie Policy but does reserve the right to release information as set forth therein and below. When you register, you will also be asked to enter some personal information. Please keep in mind when choosing a user name and filling out your profile that whenever you post to a message board your user name and a link to your profile and online status will appear when you are on the Forums. Your profile may display historical information such as “joined,” “last visit” or number of posts. Altova may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, a user name (or email address) that is already being used by someone else, impersonates another person, belongs to another person (without his or her prior consent), violates the intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity, is vulgar or otherwise offensive, or that Altova rejects for any other reason at our sole discretion. In consideration of your use of the Forums, you agree that all information provided in your profile is accurate, true, current and complete.
You may never use another's account without permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Altova immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Altova will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Altova or others due to such unauthorized use.
Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that the user, and not Altova, is entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via the Forums. No user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities on the Forums that, in the judgment of Altova, is likely to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual property. Altova reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse or delete any Content at any time. Altova shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably considers to violate this Agreement or be otherwise illegal. Altova, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by Altova to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Forums’ users and the public.
Altova does not control the Content posted to the Forums and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will Altova be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via the Forums. Each user, by using the Forums, may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable and hereby do waive any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Altova with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless Altova, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Forums. Each user must evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of any Content including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
By sending or transmitting to Altova Content or by posting such Content to any area of the Forums, you grant Altova and Altova’s designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to link to, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), adapt, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform or otherwise use such Content in any media now known or hereafter developed. If submitted with Content or as part of your registration, you hereby grant Altova permission to display your logo, trademarks and company name on the Forums and in press and other public releases or filings. Further, by submitting Content to Altova, you acknowledge that you have the authority to grant such rights to Altova. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF ANY COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN ANY CONTENT YOU SUBMIT.
J.	DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT.
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further detail):

Attention: DMCA Notice - General Counsel

K.	DCMA COUNTER-NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE.
After receiving a notification of alleged infringement, Altova will remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. At the same time, Altova will provide the poster of the contested material with a copy of the notice. The provider of the affected material may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Please be advised that you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations pursuant to federal law in the counter notification. When we receive a counter notification, we may reinstate the material in question. To file a counter notification the provider of the affected material must provide a written communication (by postal mail, overnight mail, or, when digitally-signed, by email) that sets forth the items specified below.
To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):
a.	Identify the material that Altova has removed or to which Altova has disabled access and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (e.g. the URL).
b.	Provide your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in Massachusetts (if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Altova may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the initial notification of infringement or an agent of such person.
c.	Include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the removed material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”
d.	Sign the paper or affix an electronic or digital signature to the communication in a form reasonably acceptable to Altova.
e.	Send electronically or digitally-signed communication to legal@altova.com.
f.	Send written communication to the following address:
Altova, Inc.
900 Cummings Center, Suite 314T
Beverly, MA 01915
USA
Attention: DMCA Notice - General Counsel
Upon receipt of a counter notification in substantial compliance with the DMCA, Altova will provide the person who provided the initial notification of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification. After receipt of the counter notification, Altova will generally replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it, unless Altova’s designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order regarding the removed material.
Altova is generally unable to evaluate the merits of trademark disputes because trademark rights may be based on registration or common law use, exist only for certain categories of goods or services and may differ internationally. Therefore, Altova expects you to resolve trademark disputes directly with the Content provider rather than utilizing Altova as an intermediary.
L.	WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.
YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALTOVA, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND YOUR USE THEREOF.

Article 26 of the European Union's Data Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to this Agreement, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and the processing of that information as described in this Terms of Use, the Altova Privacy Policy, and the Altova Cookie Policy.
