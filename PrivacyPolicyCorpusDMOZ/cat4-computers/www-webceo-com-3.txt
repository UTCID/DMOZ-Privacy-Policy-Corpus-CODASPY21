Privacy Policy
Last Revision: June 22, 2020
WebCEO LP (hereinafter "WebCEO") is firmly committed to the privacy of its customers. WebCEO shall take all reasonable measures to have your personal information protected to ensure you feel safe and secure.
This Privacy Policy covers how WebCEO uses personal information that users provide to WebCEO when they use the WebCEO software service (hereinafter "WebCEO") through our software (cloud-based SEO platform) and our website located at https://www.webceo.com (the “Website”). Such service, the software and the Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Service”. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. By using any of the services you accept the terms of our Privacy Policy.
How We Collect and Use Your Information
You can browse the WebCEO website, located at https://www.webceo.com, without providing any personally identifying information.
To start using WebCEO, you will need to register at
https://online.webceo.com
and provide some personal information such as a unique email address and password, or get authorized with your Facebook, Google, LinkedIn or Yahoo account. We may use your Personal Information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve the Service, to customize your experience or to send updates or notices about the Service.
If you choose to link your Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo or Google account to WebCEO, you will be prompted to allow us to get access to your email and name from your Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo or Google account, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can delete your WebCEO account and thus the connection to your social media account or service account at any time by contacting our support team.
The information that WebCEO collects about you can be classified as Personally Identifying Information and Anonymous Information. Personally Identifying Information refers to information that identifies you as a person, for example, your name, postal address, phone number, email address, payment details. Anonymous Information refers to information that does not identify a specific individual. We may use and analyze the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our website and the products and services we offer. We may collect information from third party service providers only upon your grant of respective permissions.
Personally Identifying Information (PII)
We collect your email address when you register in the Service. If you subscribe to one of the paid service plans in the WebCEO cloud-based SEO platform, we collect such information as your full name, billing address, credit card information, phone number and other billing information.
We may use your PII to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve the Service, to customize your experience at the Website, or to send updates or notices about the Service. We also use your PII to bill you for the Service subscriptions and other charges. The billing is performed by a third-party billing service that meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards securing your sensitive financial and billing information.
Anonymous Information
Every time you visit the Website, WebCEO collects certain technical information from your Web browser. This includes your internet connection, browser language, operating system, hardware specs, the pages that were visited and returned to, the time spent on the Website by a visitor, the referring site and any keywords used to find the Website on search engines. This information does not contain any reference to personal information. This information can only be accessed by
and can be used with the sole purpose of tracking visits to the Website and improve the experience, content and layout of the Website. Using the anonymous information, WebCEO can also identify defects in the Service and thus continually improve the quality of the Service.
Data Policy and Cookie Policy
As is common practice with almost all professional websites and services, this site uses cookies. Cookies are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This chapter describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site’s functionality.For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies .
Cookies are also the cornerstone for any Web analytics solution that tracks interaction between a browser and a website. WebCEO uses information collected from cookies to track the pages of the Websites that our users view, the browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Websites.
We use third-party analytics services to help understand your usage of our services. We utilize Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, to better understand your use of our Website and Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Websites, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data collected to track and examine the use of the Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Website to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. WebCEO has implemented Remarketing with Google Analytics for Display Advertising online. WebCEO and third-party vendors, including Google Inc., use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a person's past visits to the Website. As a result, WebCEO's ads are displayed on sites across the Web. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available here.
We provide a limited amount of your information (such as sign-up date and some personal information like your email address) to Intercom, Inc. (“Intercom”) and utilize Intercom to collect data for analytics purposes when you visit our website or use our product. As a data processor acting on our behalf, Intercom analyzes your use of our website and/or product and tracks our relationship by way of cookies and similar technologies so that we can improve our service to you. For more information on Intercom's use of cookies, please visit https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#cookie-policy. We may also use Intercom as a medium for communications, either through email, or through messages within our product(s). As part of our service agreements, Intercom collects publicly available contact and social information related to you, such as your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses, to enhance your user experience. For more information on the privacy practices of Intercom, please visit https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy. Intercom’s services are governed by Intercom’s terms of use which can be found at https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#terms. If you would like to opt out of having this information collected by or submitted to Intercom, please contact us.
If you are subscribed to the Service and you wish to log in to your Service account, your Web browser must accept cookies. A cookie/session variable is assigned to you when you log in, and is placed on your computer for programming purposes only. It ensures that you have properly logged in and that your personal information is only accessible to you. The Web browser's settings can be customized to refuse cookies and to remove them from your computer.
Connecting to Google Applications via the WebCEO service
WebCEO provides several tools that allow users to connect with certain Google services, such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console and Google My Business. WebCEO's Google Ads tool pulls data from Google Analytics so your Google Ads and Google Analytics accounts should be connected. Different WebCEO tools may ask for different permissions, so it is important to review the requested permissions before allowing access.
In order for these WebCEO applications to work properly, a user must begin the process by clicking the 'Connect' button. The user will be taken to a secure page on Google.com via a pop-up window or tab, where the permissions the tool requires will be displayed. If the user consents to grant WebCEO permission, Google will issue a token that our tools can use to access the requested information.
After receiving permission, WebCEO can, within the scope of the approved access, request information about, or data from, any profile the user has access to. For these tools, WebCEO uses a short-lived access token to request user Google Analytics, Search Console or Google My Business data.
The information that we request is used by our tools in calculations and visualizations about your selected data. We store the requested data up to 30 days to build reports and provide additional analytics data in various WebCEO tools. At the end of the specified period we delete the data and make a new request. If a user revokes access to the Google Analytics, Search Console or Google My Business data, we delete all previously requested data.
By default, our tools are able to see the email address of the user’s account. Our tools do not ever see or store a user’s password, as that is entered on a secure pop-up window or tab on Google’s website and not visible to us. At any time the user can revoke access to their Google Analytics, Search Console or Google My Business data in the WebCEO settings.
We shall not disclose, sell or rent your Google Analytics, Search Console or Google My Business data to any third party. We shall share your Google Analytics, Search Console or Google My Business data with the third parties only if you instruct us to and only if such information is required to provide you with specific services.
To monitor which tools by WebCEO and others tools, have been granted access to your information, and to see which permissions have been granted, review your connected applications here: myaccount.google.com/permissions
