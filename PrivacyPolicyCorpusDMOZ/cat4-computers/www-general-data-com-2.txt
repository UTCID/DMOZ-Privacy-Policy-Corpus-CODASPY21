WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SITE AND THE MATERIALS IT CONTAINS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

GDC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU (AND NOT GDC) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.
GDC MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS REGARDING (1) THE CURRENCY, CORRECTNESS, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR OPERATION OF THE SITE AND THE MATERIALS; OR (2) YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR MATERIALS; OR (3) ANY THIRD-PARTY WEB SITE YOU MAY ACCESS THROUGH THE SITE. DESPITE THE CHOICE OF OHIO LAW, THE MANDATORY LAW OF SOME JURISDICTIONS DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, TERMS, REPRESENTATIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS ARE PROVIDED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SOME MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GDC, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEM BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, INTEREST OR BUSINESS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S CLAIMS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELIANCE ON OR THE USE OF, DELAY IN BEING ABLE TO USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, THE MATERIALS IT PROVIDES, OR ANY OTHER HYPERLINKED WEB SITE OR ANY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF GDC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. DESPITE THE CHOICE OF OHIO LAW, THE MANDATORY LAW OF SOME JURISDICTIONS DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS CLAUSE SHALL NOT EXCLUDE OR IN ANY WAY LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR (I) FRAUD OR (II) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY ITS NEGLIGENCE.
EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS RELATED TO PURCHASES MADE THROUGH THE SITE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY WHICH GDC, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND ITS LICENSORS, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEM MAY INCUR FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE EQUIVALENT OF $100.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless GDC, its suppliers and licensors, their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates, and each of them from any third-party claim, liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Site or any Materials it contains; your failure to comply with these Terms of Use; your infringement, violation, or misappropriation of any third party rights or any applicable law or regulation.
Jurisdiction
The Site is controlled and operated by GDC from its offices within the State of Ohio, United States of America. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms of Use, including without limitation this paragraph.
General
Unless otherwise required by local law, these Terms of Use shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. GDC's performance of these Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use shall derogate GDC's right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by GDC with respect to such use. We may provide notices to you via postings on the Site, via email or via any other means of communication for which you have provided contact information. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use by GDC shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and GDC’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein, and replace all prior or contemporaneous communications, oral or written. If there is any discrepancy between the English version and other language versions of these Terms of Use, the English version shall prevail.
