About Oracle
Strategic Acquisitions
Oracle and Passlogix
Oracle Buys Passlogix
Oracle has acquired Passlogix, adding enterprise single sign-on (ESSO) and network authentication capabilities to Oracle's Identity Management Suite.
Building on a successful partnership of more than three years, this combination is expected to build on integration points that deliver value to customers, and better alignment of our technologies for a more comprehensive ESSO offering. With increased investment in ESSO technology, we expect to provide enterprises with new capabilities such as strong network authentication that supports a variety of credential types—improving security while providing more user flexibility—and support for modern architectures and devices, cloud deployment and newer browsers.
