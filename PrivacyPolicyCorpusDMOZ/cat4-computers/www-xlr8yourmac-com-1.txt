Warning on Fake/Spoofed Emails:
If you ever get an unsolicited mail (i.e. not in Reply to Your mail) 'from' any of these sites/domains, it is a Fake.
I only send mail in reply to reader questions, requests for help, etc.(I do not send any newsletters, etc. either.)
Sponsor Ad/Pricing Notes:
Due to frequent price changes and potential supply issues, pricing shown in advertiser banners may not be current and not all items may always be available/in-stock. Check the linked/advertiser pages for current pricing and availability.
And any Prices/sales notes/links, etc on archives pages were valid for that day only. (One man site here and impossible for me to keep up with off-site pricing changes. Sorry.)
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, BECAUSE USE OF THE SITE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
The following are terms of a legal agreement between you and Accelerate Your Mac!, its publishers, subsidaries and affiliates. By accessing, browsing and/or using this site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these terms and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. These terms may be changed at any time without notice.
This site provides a range of information about computer hardware, software and related products, including without limitation product descriptions, pricing and editorial commentary (collectively called "information"). Although I try to
provide Information that is useful, I cannot possibly insure the accuracy of all of the Information at all times (specs, hardware/software designs, pricing, etc. are changed without notice by manufacturers all the time). You should not rely on the information in situations where its inaccuracy would cause you to suffer any significant loss. All reader comments and opinions do not
necessarily represent those of the site publisher.
THE INFORMATION ON THIS SITE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY AND "WITH ALL FAULTS." I MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR SUITABILITY OF THE INFORMATION, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. POSTS OF SALES, ITEMS, OR REVIEWS ARE NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPANIES MENTIONED.
xlr8yourmac, accelerateyourmac, and related sites are all provided "as is" without warranty of any kind whatsoever. The owner/authors thereof, shall not be held responsible or liable, under any circumstances, for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the information within.
The various products referenced or reviewed on this Site (hereafter referred to as "products") are provided by third party vendors. I do not sell, resell or license any of these products, and disclaim any responsibility for or liability related to the products. Any questions, complaints or claims related to any product should be directed to the appropriate vendor.
The Information is being provided free of charge for non-commercial purposes. Accordingly, I SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OR UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT MAY BE SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER USER OF THIS SITE IN CONNECTION WITH OR AS A RESULT OF THE INFORMATION OR THE PRODUCTS, REGARDLESS OF HOW SUCH DAMAGES MAY ARISE AND EVEN IF I HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. (It is impossible for me to even read 25% of the mail being sent every day).
The information here is subject to change without notice and archived pages older than the current date may contact sale items, products or services no longer available (due to company product changes, companies going out of business, price changes or product availability changes beyond our control).

Overclocking. Although many manufacturer's products are adjustable for operational speeds and these settings
are explored for review purposes, all speeds above those of the rated components is risky and is not recommended for anyone. Any time you run
a CPU, cache, motherboard, Video card or other component beyond its rated speed there is the risk of
failure, data corruption, and/or long term negative impacts to reliability. Heed all manufacturer's recommendations on speed settings and if in doubt, ask the manufacturer for recommended settings. The information on this site is for reference only and cannot be guaranteed to be
reliable in the short or long term.You are in control of your hardware and are therefore ultimately
responsible for any choices you make as far as speed settings or use of the manufacturer's adjustable
circuit cards and software controls. Understand that running any component beyond its rated speed
is risky and can void the warranty. Refer to the documentation and consult the hardware
manufacturer for warranty impact and recommended speeds.
Although it is a PC site, Mac overclockers may want to read the risks of overclocking (for example
www.pcguide.com/opt/oc/risksRisksCPU-c.html). Overclocking risks include electromigration and hardware failure as noted in the URL above. The risks to data (and voided warranties) are why I don't recommend it to others.
