This Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of One World Hosting, Inc. ("OWH") or AAA Domain Register ("AAA") for web hosting and/or domain name related services. You certify that you are at least 18 years of age. To become an OWH|AAA account holder, you must read and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement, the fee schedules on the Online Order forms and any policies that are or may be published by OWH|AAA. This Agreement will become effective when accepted by OWH|AAA. By posting notice 30 days in advance at a web page available on our web site (http://oneworldhosting.com), OWH|AAA may modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the prices of its services, as well as discontinue or change the services offered. You will be bound by the modified Agreement, prices and/or policies if you continue to use the services.
Scope of Services and Your Obligations
1.1. This Agreement defines the terms and conditions of the OWH|AAA services as offered by OWH|AAA and used by you, including the provision of web hosting and domain name services via our servers and connectivity to the Internet (the "Services"). OWH|AAA will provide the Services in exchange for payment of fees and full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In performing the Services, OWH|AAA maintains control and ownership of any and all Internet protocol ("IP") numbers and addresses that may be assigned to you and reserves the right to change or remove any and all IP numbers and addresses at its sole discretion. OWH|AAA uses the phrase "unlimited resources" to be defined as: "within the limits of the specific server that the hosting account resides on." Calculating this amount also must take into consideration preserving the integrity of all of the servers safe performance parameters and specification.
1.2. As part of the Services, OWH|AAA will also provide your own web-based client record (the "Client Area") containing links to your payment history, summaries of the Services you have chosen, newsletters and other current information.
1.3. You are responsible for producing, electronically uploading and maintaining HTML files, execution scripts, applets and applications (the "Upload Materials") to your website, and you hereby warrant that all Upload Materials shall be owned or properly licensed by you and shall not adversely impact the Services or violate any rights of any third parties. You are responsible for ensuring that all Upload Materials will function properly and as intended. You are responsible for all activity originating from your website, unless proven to be a victim of outside hacking or address forgery. You assume responsibility for all material on your website that may be put on by a third party (such as the usage of Free For All links pages). Use of the Services requires a certain level of knowledge in the use of Internet languages, protocols, and software, which can vary depending on your anticipated use and desired content of your website, and includes, but is not limited to, the following: web publishing requires knowledge of HTML, properly locating and linking documents, FTPing web contents, graphics, text, sound, image mapping, etc.; CGI-scripts requires knowledge of the UNIX environment, tar & gunzip commands, Perl, CShell scripts, permissions, etc.; and mail requires knowledge of use of mail clients to receive and send mail, etc. You acknowledge that you have the necessary knowledge to create, modify and maintain your website. OWH|AAA assumes no responsibility to provide you with such knowledge.
Finally, you are responsible for keeping all applications and associated code up to date with current release versions. Failure to keep applications up to date may result in suspension, forced updates, and other measures as we deem necessary to secure the server.
1.4. In connection with the Services, OWH|AAA may provide for your use certain tools and software, including, but not limited to, certain specialty scripting software and/or certain programming language software for designing websites (collectively, the "Tools"). Access to these Tools may be accessed via your Control Panel. These Tools are copyrighted and proprietary property owned by OWH|AAA. To the extent that such Tools are provided to you, you are granted a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Tools in object-code form only for your internal use, solely in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement.
1.5. Every web hosting account with OWH|AAA features a 30-day money back guarantee. If you choose to cancel your account within the first 30 days, we will refund all routine account fees, exclusive of any set up or domain names fees. All fees associated with domain name purchase, lease, renewal or transfer are completely non-refundable. Accounts closed after 30 days do not qualify for refund of any pre-paid fees. To close your account, log into your client area, https://oneworldhosting.com/support/clientarea.php and select My Services. Along the right side of the page you'll see a little green arrow icon - click on that and you'll see the request cancellation link toward the bottom - we request this cancellation process strictly to validate ownership.
1.6. For server restoration purposes only, OWH|AAA makes full back-ups of websites weekly; however, OWH|AAA makes no guarantees of any kind, either expressed or implied, as to the integrity of these back-ups. You are responsible to maintain local copies of your website.

THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO ALL VIOLATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT.
4.2. Use and Misuse of Materials. Materials in the public domain (e.g., images, text, and programs) may be downloaded or uploaded using the Services. You may also re-distribute materials in the public domain. You assume all risks regarding the determination of whether the material is in the public domain.
You are prohibited from storing, distributing or transmitting any unlawful material through the Services. Examples of unlawful material include, but are not limited to, threats of physical harm, child pornography, and copyrighted, trademarked and other proprietary material used without proper authorization. Pornography and sex-related merchandising, or links to such material, even if legal, are not acceptable uses of OWH|AAA's servers. You may not post, upload or otherwise distribute copyrighted material on OWH|AAA's servers without the consent of the copyright holder.
Unacceptable uses of website content also include the presence of the following programs or the activities associated with them, regardless of whether or not any actual intrusion results in the corruption or loss of data: server broadcast messages or any message sent on an intrusive basis to any directly or indirectly attached network; attempts to circumvent any user authentication or security of host, network, or account; accessing data not intended for user; probing the security of any network; spawning dozens of processes; port scans, ping floods, packet spoofing, and forging router information; denial of service attacks, sniffers, flooding, spoofing, ping bombing, smurfs, winnuke, land and teardrop; promulgation of viruses; and IRC bots, such as eggdrop or BitchX.

However, examples of unacceptable activities include posting private information about a person without his or her consent, defaming a person or business, and knowingly making available code that will have a deleterious effect on third-party computers. Where there are allegations that your on-line activity has violated the legal rights of a third party, OWH|AAA will not substitute itself for a court of law in deciding tort claims raised by the third party.
4.3. Email Use. Unacceptable affronts to netiquette and unacceptable activities include, but are not limited to, the following: spamming (sending unsolicited advertising to those with which you have no existing business relationship and posting off-topic advertising in newsgroups); spoofing (using a return email address that is not the valid reply address of the sender or sending an email message that does not contain enough information to enable the recipient to identify you); passive spamming (promoting a website hosted by OWH|AAA by spamming from some other source); trolling (posting controversial messages in newsgroups to generate responses); mailbombing (inundating a user with email without any serious intent to correspond or sending large or multiple files to a user); generating a higher volume of outgoing mail than a normal user (over 10% of available system resources); propagating chain letters; and subscribing someone else to an electronic mailing list without that person's permission. A message is considered unsolicited if it is posted in violation of a newsgroup charter or sent to a recipient who has not requested the message. Making an email address available to the public does not constitute a request to receive messages. Distribution of mass emailing programs is also prohibited. All recipients on a mailing list must have personally subscribed. Mailing lists may not be used to distribute unsolicited email. If you are repeatedly mailbombed or attract such behavior, the Services will be terminated.
You should not send email to any user who does not wish to receive it, either at OWH|AAA or elsewhere. OWH|AAA recognizes that email is an informal medium; however, you must refrain from sending further email to a user after receiving a request to stop.
OWH|AAA reserves the right to zip (compress) any customer email box that exceeds 50 megs in size. Customers with zipped boxes will be notified and instructed on how to access or download their zipped email files. If zipped boxes remain unaccessed for 30 days OWH|AAA reserves the right to delete the email box.
You may not alter the headers of email messages to disguise their identity or to prevent users from responding to the messages. OWH|AAA may disclose the usernames of accounts responsible for forged email messages to system administrators or users requesting the information.
Violations of the OWH|AAA policies outlined herein can sometimes result in massive numbers of email responses. If you receive so much email that OWH|AAA resources are affected, OWH|AAA staff may shut down your mailbox.
OWH|AAA reserves the right to subscribe to multiple RBLs (real-time blocking lists) and other server-wide spam and virus fighting measures we deem necessary to automatically block known open SMTP relays and known spamming relays. As per Section 2, OWH|AAA will not be liable for any costs or damages associated with any failure to receive legitimate email due to our spam fighting procedures. Clients do have the option to request relocation of their service to a non-RBL configured server by contacting OWH|AAA support.
4.4. System Security. You are prohibited from utilizing the Services to compromise the security of system resources or accounts on servers at OWH|AAA or at any other site. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security or containing viruses or trojans are prohibited. Examples of these tools include, but are not limited to, password guessing programs, cracking tools or network probing tools.
If you are involved in violations of system security, OWH|AAA reserves the right to release all usernames of users involved in such violations to system administrators at other sites in order to assist them in resolving security incidents. OWH|AAA will also fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected lawbreakers.
4.5. System Resources. System abuse includes any use of OWH|AAA resources that disrupts the normal use of its servers or services for others. Examples of system abuse include running excessive numbers of processes or consuming excessive amounts of CPU time, memory or disk space.
Any usage of 10% or more of OWH|AAA's system resources is an undue burden on OWH|AAA's system and is unacceptable. If your usage ever exceeds 10% of system resources, your account may be terminated immediately and without prior notice.
Further, running programs in the background on a OWH|AAA server without OWH|AAA's prior written authorization, or running chat rooms, Internet Relay Chat, IRC bots, more then 1,000 emails a day and the like are not acceptable uses of OWH|AAA's servers.
Due to their use of flat files instead of databases, One World does not allow the use of UBB or YABB bulletin boards. Use of these boards for large or very active forums may result in system performance degradation, and cannot be allowed in our shared server environment. One World suggests using VBulletin or phpBB as more efficient, database-driven alternatives to these bulletin boards.
5. WH|AAA's Right to Terminate Agreement
(a) OWH|AAA reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Services to you and remove or prevent access to any material from your website at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any conduct that OWH|AAA, in its sole discretion, believes violates this Agreement or is otherwise harmful to OWH|AAA's interests or the interests of other accountholders.
(b) OWH|AAA also reserves the right to comply with the take-down provisions of the DMCA and to seek injunctive, declaratory, interpleader or other judicial or equitable relief (and, pending such action, to suspend all access to your website) if any third-party claim is made that your website content or use violates any of the acceptable uses or your obligations or representations described in this Agreement.
6. Arbitration; Governing Law
6.1. Except for OWH|AAA's compliance with take-down provisions of the DMCA or injunctive or other equitable actions initiated by OWH|AAA pursuant to Section 5(b), if any controversy or dispute arises in connection with this Agreement, the Services or your use of OWH|AAA's servers, such controversy or dispute shall first be presented for resolution by OWH|AAA and you. If no resolution is reached within 7 days thereafter, then such controversy or dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Columbus, Ohio, under the then-current rules of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. Each party shall select an arbitrator with expertise in computer law and the Internet, and these two arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator with such expertise. The validity, terms, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed and construed by its provisions and in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio (without regard to conflicts of laws principles).
6.2. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Columbus, Ohio, for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to Section 5(b) of this Agreement and the arbitration contemplated by this Section 7.

As consideration for the domain name registration services provided by AAA Domain Register to you, you agree to pay OWH|AAA, prior to the effectiveness of the desired domain name registration, the then-current amounts set forth in the OWH|AAA price schedule for the initial registration of the domain name and, should you choose to renew the registration, the then-current amounts set forth in the OWH|AAA price schedule for any subsequent renewals of the registration. To view the current rates for using the OWH|AAA domain name services, please see the OWH|AAA FAQ. All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term. OWH|AAA reserves the right to change fees, surcharges, renewal fees or to institute new fees at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion.
Your requested domain name will not be registered unless we receive actual payment of the registration or renewal fee.
In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with the payments of the registration or renewal fee for your domain name registration, you agree and acknowledge that the domain name registration shall be transferred to OWH|AAA as the paying entity for that registration to the registry and that we reserve all rights regarding such domain name including, without limitation, the right to make the domain name available to other parties for purchase. We will reinstate your domain name registration solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the initial registration or renewal fee and our then-current reinstatement fee, currently set at US$250.00.
You will be notified thirty (30) days prior to when a renewal fee is due. Should a renewal fee go unpaid within the time specified in a second notice or reminder regarding renewal, your registration will be cancelled. Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may indicate in the registration application or renewal form. We will renew your name for you for the term specified provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date, unless you instruct us otherwise within the time specified. If your billing information is not accurate and you wish to renew your domain name registration, we will contact you to update this information and charge you accordingly.

OWH|AAA may modify the Dispute Policy in its sole discretion at any time. Your continued designation of OWH|AAA as the registrar of your domain name after modification to the Dispute Policy becomes effective constitutes your acceptance of those modifications. You agree that you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time a third party challenges your domain name.

If you license use of a domain name to a third party, you are nonetheless the holder of record of the domain name and are responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical, administrative, and zone contact information.
You acknowledge that OWH|AAA will make some of the information that you provide during the registration process publicly available as required by ICANN. Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may impose guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that OWH|AAA may or must make available to the public or to private entities.

IN NO EVENT SHALL OWH|AAA'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00 USD). BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

You must remedy any breach of your obligations under this Agreement within 30 days after notice by OWH|AAA. If you fail to cure the breach within such period, OWH|AAA shall have the right in its sole discretion to delete, revoke, suspend, transfer or otherwise modify your registration of the domain name.
You also agree that OWH|AAA shall have the right in its sole discretion to delete, revoke, suspend, transfer or otherwise modify a domain name registration at such time as OWH|AAA receives a properly authenticated order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or arbitration award, requiring the deletion, revocation, suspension, transfer or modification of the domain name registration.
7.11. Right of Refusal
OWH|AAA, in its sole discretion, reserves the right (i) to refuse to register or reserve your chosen domain name and (ii) to provide any other service requested. Further, OWH|AAA reserves the right to delete your domain name within thirty (30) days after receipt by OWH|AAA of payment for such services, or the date of registration of your domain name, if later. In the event that we do not register or reserve your domain name or provide other requested services, or we delete your domain name within such thirty (30) day period, we agree to refund your applicable fees paid. You agree that OWH|AAA shall not be liable to you for any loss or damages that may result from our refusal to provide any such services, or the deletion of your domain name.

You agree to review OWH|AAAâs web site periodically to keep track of any such changes to the Agreement. Such changes will remain binding on you until such time as OWH|AAA is no longer the registrar of your domain name. If any such change constitutes a materially adverse change to you, you may change the term of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no provision of this Agreement, including the Dispute Policy, may be amended or modified by you except by means of a written document signed by OWH|AAA.
7.14. General
This Agreement, including without limitation the fee schedule and the Dispute Policy, together with all amendments or modifications to any of them, constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and OWH|AAA, and supersedes and governs all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.
If your domain name is parked on OWH|AAA's servers but not in active use, you agree that OWH|AAA may point such domain name to an under construction or registered or reserved style page designated by OWH|AAA until you request otherwise.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. The failure of OWH|AAA to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by OWH|AAA of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole. OWH|AAA will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of OWH|AAA as reflected in the original provision. All provisions of sections 1 through 14 of this Agreement shall survive the termination or other expiration of this Agreement.

Failure on the part of a party to complain of any act or failure to act of another party or to declare another party in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by the first mentioned party of its rights under this Agreement.
