To be considered a Qualified User, your information will be provided directly Fluenz’s third-party verification system. Fluenz reserves the right to determine if you are a Qualifying User in our sole discretion.
(g) You agree to promptly notify Fluenz of any changes to the Payment Method you provided while any subscriptions remain outstanding. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions purchased by you.
(h) In the course of your use of the Products, Fluenz and its third party payment service provider may receive and implement updated credit card information from your credit card issuer in order to prevent your subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to Fluenz and Fluenz’s third party payment service provider at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer.
(i) Our obligation to provide the Products only comes into being when we take receipt of your Order, and we confirm your purchase to you by email.

“Gift Subscriptions” are pre-paid memberships to the Product. A person who purchases the gift is referred to in these terms as the “Giftor”. A person who receives and redeems a Gift Subscription to the Products is referred to in these terms as the “Recipient”. Gift subscriptions are paid for as a one-off upfront payment. Once bought, the Giftor will receive an Order confirmation and receipt. The Fluenz gift subscription will be sent to the Recipient on the Giftor’s specified date. Gifting codes can only be used once in the country for which they were purchased and cannot be redeemed for cash, resold or combined with any other offers, including free trial. Please note that gifting codes cannot be redeemed if the Recipient has already purchased a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone application, or the Google Play Store or our Android application. We will automatically bill the Payment Method you provided for any purchased Gift Subscriptions at the time of purchase, not delivery. There are no refunds or other credits for Gift Subscription that are not redeemed. Fluenz will notify the Recipient prior to the end of the Gift Subscription that the gift period is about to expire. Fluenz is not responsible if a Gift Subscription is lost, stolen or used without permission.
2.7 CORPORATE AND EDUCATIONAL

In some cases, these Enterprises may supplement these Terms with their own terms and conditions. In such event, these Enterprise terms and conditions shall also apply to your use of the Products. In the event of any conflict with such additional terms and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail.
2.8 CHANGING FEES AND CHARGES

We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any remedies in respect of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms or the documents referred to in them. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract. Nothing in this section limits or excludes any liability for fraud.
12.10 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
A person who is not party to these Terms will not, subject to section 12 (DMCA), have any rights under or in connection with these Terms.
12.11 OUR LIABILITY
(a) We will use reasonable endeavors to remedy faults in the Products. If we fail to comply with these Terms, we will be liable to you only for the purchase price of the Products in question. In addition, we will not be liable for:
(i) Faulty operation of computers during the registration process or during completion of a subscription or during the transmission of any data and/or for incorrect or overly slow transmission of data by the internet provider and/or any damage that occurs due to information submitted by you not being received by us or not being received promptly or not being considered, as a consequence of technical faults with our software or hardware (whether or not they are within or outside of our control).
(ii) Any loss or damage due to viruses or other malicious software that may infect your Device, computer equipment, software, data or other property caused by you accessing, using or downloading from the Products, or from transmissions via emails or attachments received from us.
(iii) Any use of websites linked to the Products but operated by third parties.
(b) To the extent permitted by law, Fluenz and its affiliates, suppliers, clients, or licensors (collectively, the “Protected Entities”) shall not be liable for any consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising from, or directly or indirectly related to, the use of, or the inability to use, the Products or the content, materials and functions related thereto, your provision of information via the Products, or lost business or lost sales, or any errors, viruses or bugs contained in the Products, even if such Protected Entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall the Protected Entities be liable for or in connection with any content posted, transmitted, exchanged or received by or on behalf of any user or other person on or through the Products. In no event shall the total aggregate liability of the Protected Entities to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise) arising from these terms of use or your use of the Products exceed, in the aggregate, the amount, if any, paid by you to Fluenz for your use of the Products.
12.12 ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH FLUENZ, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM FLUENZ.
(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Fluenz are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
(b) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.
If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Fluenz. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Fluenz for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
(c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Fluenz. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Fluenz.
(d) Jury Trial Waiver. You and Fluenz waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Fluenz elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Fluenz over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Fluenz waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND FLUENZ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Fluenz are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in section 13.13 below.
(f) Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. If you do so, neither you nor Fluenz can force the other to arbitrate. To opt-out, you must notify Fluenz in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Fluenz account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Fluenz, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 1000 5th St, suite 200, Miami Beach, FL 33139 or usersupport@fluenz.com
(g) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Fluenz may bring an individual action in small claims court.
(h) Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Fluenz.
12.13 EXCLUSIVE VENUE
To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Fluenz agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the South Florida area. You and Fluenz consent to the personal jurisdiction of courts in that area.
12.14 CHOICE OF LAW
Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of Florida govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.
12.15 SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
These Terms are effective and were last updated on April 12, 2019.
