Impact of ARRA 2009
[email protected]
Health Privacy Resources
Health Privacy Project at Center for Democracy and Technology
Health IT and electronic health information exchange have tremendous potential to improve health care quality, reduce costs, and empower consumers
The public wants health IT – but also has significant privacy concerns
Failure to build foundation of trust is an obstacle to achieving greater health information exchange
Health Privacy Project at CDT
For years there was no progress on resolving the privacy and security issues raised by e-health
Project’s aim: Develop and promote workable privacy and security policy solutions for personal health information
Evolution of Federal Privacy Protections
1996 – Enactment of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Congress gives itself 3 years to enact privacy legislation
Rulemaking
1999 – Proposed rules
2000 – Final rule
2002 – Regulatory changes
2003 – Effective for most
Era of Health Information Technology
Health IT bills stalled in 108th &109th
Privacy was framed as the obstacle – but it wasn’t the only issue
Legislation moved furthest in 110th – but economic woes stalled progress
ARRA (Title XIII- HITECH)
Broke the privacy "logjam"
Most significant change to the healthcare privacy and security environment since the original HIPAA privacy rule
Not a change to everything about HIPAA – but some significant changes that will need to be addressed by many entities handling health care information
