dslreports.com and your privacy
dslreports.com [referred to herein as DSLR] detail our policy on collecting and using personal information.
DSLR's Policy
DSLR's policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet site
is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. DSLR does not
disclose rent or sell your email address or any other information we may receive
to any third party - unless you specifically request this..
In registration, DSLR requires an email address.
all other details are optional.
At any time, you may remove your records (but not your past contributions in
the form of forum posts, ISP reviews or other data) from our user database,
and receive confirmation by email that your identifying data has been erased
from our production systems.
Please note that contributions you make to the site (postings, reviews,
news, and other writings), under our terms of use policy, are ours to
use (delete, republish, modify) as we like. In case where these contributions
are provided to third parties, aggregated or published, information
sufficient to identify the original author will be removed, OR your permission
to keep the identification with the material will be sought via an email
to your registered user address.. In the case that your email address is
not answered, or no longer valid, we consider any notification obligation
we have relating to use of the material is discharged.
DSLR and Cookies
Upon your first login to DSLR, We send a "cookie" to your
browser. It can also store personal preferences and user data.
A cookie tells
us that you previously logged in sucessfully, and therefore gains you
access to the site. Google analytics is also used for data aggregation of
visitor page requests.
DSLR and Google Analytics
We have enabled the Google Analytics Advertising Feature: "Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting". This collects data via Google Advertising cookies (more at this google page) and anonymous identifiers (more at this google page) in addition to data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation.
We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.
Should you choose to, you can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by using this broswer add-on here: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
Advertising networks such as Google Adsense, and others at our discretion, may also send cookies to your system. This is done for the purpose of tracking advertising performance, managing the display of advertising and for improving relevancy of adverts shown to users. At no time is any personally identifiable information shared from DSLR to third-parties without prior consent being received.
DSLR uses a cookie to associate your browser with your registration details, and to track usage.
Ad serving
Ads are served by Google Adsense and by other third-party advertising networks at our discretion. With the exception of errors, we do not show display adverts from these networks to logged-in members of the site.
Third party revenue sources
SKIM LINKS
This site also earns revenue using Skimlinks and Amazon. In the interests of disclosure and ethics, we want to be open about how we make money from our site. Besides display advertising, we also may get paid a commission if you purchase a product or service via a link anywhere on our site. Skim Links is a 3rd party service that handles this for links that are not Amazon. For Amazon links we use our own referral code. We do not know what products you have purchased, and Skimlinks and Amazon do not know who you are on our site.
Changes
We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time. If the change involves a reduction in privacy protection of any kind,
a notice will be posted to our site feedback forum explaining the change.
Change History:
June 2015 - "DSLR and Google Analytics"
October 2016 - "Third party Revenue Sources"
