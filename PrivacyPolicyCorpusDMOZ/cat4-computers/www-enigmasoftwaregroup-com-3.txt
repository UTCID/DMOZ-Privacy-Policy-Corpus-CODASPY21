What is SpyHunter's Spyware HelpDesk?
Further enhancing the seamless user experience of SpyHunter, the Spyware HelpDesk for SpyHunter
subscribers has combined the latest in advanced malware removal technology with 24/7 customer support
through its interactive services. SpyHunter's Spyware HelpDesk provides subscribers with several
levels of support to resolve even the toughest malware problems. The Spyware HelpDesk includes a customer
support ticketing system that allows subscribers direct access to our technical support team. Also included
are tools that can be used by subscribers to generate diagnostic reports which can be used to analyze a
subscriber’s unique system and develop custom fixes for their individual issues. Our technical support
team can also, at your option, provide you with phone support and remote assistance to assist with any
issues. All of these features are included with the SpyHunter subscription at no additional charge. The
combined power of SpyHunter's Spyware HelpDesk and advanced malware detection and remediation engine are
engineered to help users combat ever-changing computer threats, risks and issues.
How Does SpyHunter's Spyware HelpDesk Work?
SpyHunter and its built-in Spyware HelpDesk connect our technicians directly to a subscriber (and
their computer system) in instances where SpyHunter is unable to resolve a malware issue automatically.
SpyHunter and the Spyware HelpDesk are completely integrated; you never have to leave SpyHunter
to receive help! The system is designed to allow subscribers to quickly and easily create support tickets.
The Spyware HelpDesk helps save you time by eliminating long and frustrating phone calls and hold times;
you don’t have to pick up a phone to initiate a request for help.
Cybercriminals and hackers constantly update and alter malware to avoid detection by anti-malware utilities
like SpyHunter. To proactively combat ever-evolving malware and other threats and issues, SpyHunter's
malware detection databases are frequently updated. SpyHunter also connects to our cloud servers for
additional malware identification capabilities. Intelligence gathered or developed from diagnostic reports
is utilized in updating our malware definitions. We also trawl the web to collect and analyze ever-changing
malware from dark corners of the Internet. Although no anti-virus program can assure 100%, 24/7 effectiveness,
SpyHunter is designed to detect, block and remove even the most persistent malware. This
is one reason the Spyware HelpDesk is a powerful tool to assist subscribers.
Unlike some other anti-malware solutions, SpyHunter and its Spyware HelpDesk are committed to going to
extra lengths in working with subscribers to assist in removing stubborn malware and addressing other system
issues. Subscribers can generate and submit a Diagnostic Report, which can be transmitted directly to our
technical support team.
Within 48 hours, one of our technicians will review your Diagnostic Report and generate a unique fix designed
to address your system’s individual issues. Fixes are transmitted directly to SpyHunter, which can then
execute them using its built-in advanced removal engine. The process is very user-friendly. When a fix is
received by SpyHunter, you will receive a notification that it is ready to be applied. Applying the fix
is as simple as clicking the "Apply Fix" button. SpyHunter will take care of the rest.
Our Spyware HelpDesk Support Center offers optional one-on-one customer care, included with your subscription
at no extra charge.
If neither SpyHunter nor the Spyware HelpDesk custom fix is able to resolve a subscriber's issue, subscribers
have the option to have our customer support technicians contact them by phone. Our technicians can conduct
a remote control session on the subscriber’s computer to assist with unresolved issues.
Spyware HelpDesk Key Features

assistance with a variety of issues. The Spyware HelpDesk provides a convenient and user-friendly
interface to create new tickets and to view existing tickets. Technical support assistance for your
computer issues is just a few clicks away!
Diagnostic Report
Diagnostic Reports are a valuable feature of the Spyware HelpDesk. At your option, you
can generate and transmit a diagnostic report directly to our technical support team. The
Diagnostic Report includes information on executable files currently running in memory, data
in Registry auto-start locations and certain executable files that may not have been
identified by SpyHunter. A technician can review your Diagnostic Report to identify
malware and other issues on your system. You will have the opportunity to review the
Diagnostic Report data before you opt to transmit it to our support team.
Custom Fix
When you open a support ticket and submit a Diagnostic Report, the report can be analyzed by a
technician. After identifying possible issues, the technician can create and transmit a custom
fix, specifically engineered to resolve your individual issue(s). Subscribers are notified,
directly in SpyHunter, when a fix is ready to apply. When the fix is ready, users can click
a button to have SpyHunter automatically apply the fix using its advanced malware removal
engine. This service is included with your subscription at no additional charge!
