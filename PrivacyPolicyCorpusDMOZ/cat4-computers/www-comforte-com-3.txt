With regard to further definitions in accordance with the GDPR, we refer to Art. 4 GDPR.
II. Scope of processing of personal data
Personal data of the respective users will only be processed, if this serves the functionality of the website and is necessary for the provision of the contents and services. In accordance with the data protection principle of the prohibition with reservation of permission, we only process personal data that has either been provided with the user's prior consent or such consent is not possible for factual reasons and the statutory provisions permit the processing of personal data.

According to Art. 21 Sec. 1 GDPR, you can revoke your consent to the processing of your data at any time with effect for the future, insofar as you have given your consent when accessing the website. If we base the processing of your personal data on the weighing of interests, you may object to the processing.
IV. Data erasure and storage time
The user's personal data will always be deleted if the purpose of storage no longer exists.
