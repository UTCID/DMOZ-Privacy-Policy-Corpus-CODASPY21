Privacy of Visitor Information
Privacy of individual visitor data is very important to us.
Any information you submit through our web sites will be held in
the strictest confidence. We will not release
your e-mail address or any other personal information to any
third parties without your consent.
Internet Privacy
We do not collect any personal information when you visit
our website. Any information collected in our weblogs are very generic information like browser used,
Operting system use, visit date etc. and these are for
our site visit analysis only.
Our software applications do not collect or transmit any
personal information about you.
Private & Secure Transaction
When you buy our products, any information including credit card info that you submit are
totally encrypted (jumbled-up) while sending via internet. So no one else could see the
information and thus the transaction remains highly secure.
All the information that we gather are strictly
confidential, and are not released to any third parties.
We believe that online ordering (with secure site) is safer than
giving your card number to a telephone operator, or handing over to
a waiter in a restaurant.
