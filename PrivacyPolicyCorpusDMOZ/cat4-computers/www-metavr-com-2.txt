Using a Gamepad or Joystick With VRSG
Using a Gamepad with VRSG
Gamepads and joysticks are used in VRSG solely for these three cases:
Flying around the terrain database in fixed-wing mode; press F11 on your keyboard to activate fixed wing mode.
Controlling a simulated UAV camera in UAV View (slave) mode, which enables you to attach to a DIS entity that supplies the UAV airframe telemetry. In this mode, VRSG uses an internal sensor payload model, which requires an attached joystick to pan and zoom the camera.
Creating a dismounted character to perform activities on the database in VRSG First Person Simulator; press F9 on your keyboard to instantiate an FPS character (as described below).
In these cases, VRSG works with any 8-button 4-axes input device for which the vendor provides a Windows Joystick driver. For ease of use in manipulating a character in FPS, MetaVR strongly recommends the Logitech F310 Gamepad. This device is supported by Windows and VRSG without the need to install any additional software.
Using a gamepad with First Person Simulator
The Logitech gamepad is MetaVR's device of choice for using with VRSG FPS. With two analog sticks, digital buttons, precise D-pad, and smooth, precise action, the gamepad is the ideal input device for manipulating the character's movements, and various functions such as firing weapons, laser ranging or designating in JTAC/CAS mode, and so on.
FPS functions mapped to the F310 gamepad include:
Viewing modes: third-person, first-person, JTAC, and scopes.
Movement of the FPS character, like a joystick. Pressing down on the thumbstick changes the character’s posture.
Viewing angle (head angle) relative to the FPS character’s body.
Buttons for cycling through the available firing modes and firing a round of the currently selected weapon, laser designation and laser code (in JTAC mode), tracking a location on the ground and auto-zooming while tracking.
