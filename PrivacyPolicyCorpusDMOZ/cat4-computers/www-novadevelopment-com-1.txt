Terms of UseThank you for choosing Nova Development ("Nova," "our," "us" or "we"). Your access, installation and use of our software, services and websites (the "Sites") (collectively, the "Services") is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, any applicable End User License Agreement ("EULA"), and in any other Nova agreements that relate to the Services (collectively, "Agreement").
Agreement: You acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In addition, your access, installation and/or use of the Services constitutes acceptance of such terms and conditions. Nova reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, amend or supplement any term or condition of this Agreement at any time with or without notice.  If you continue to use the Services after any such modifications, amendments or supplements are made, you are then accepting and agreeing to be bound by them. For information about our collection and use of data, you may view the most current version of our Privacy Policy.
User: You represent and warrant that (a) if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and otherwise legally competent in all respects to enter into and be bound by this Agreement or (b) if you are an entity, you are a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity in good standing, and possess all legal authority and power to enter into and be bound by this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the authority to and do hereby bind your entity and all individuals employed or engaged by your entity that may use the Services.
Products and Ordering:
1. Product Descriptions. Product descriptions are presented on the Sites and can be consulted before your order. Photographs and pictures have no contractual value.
2. No Offer. Any prices, quotations and descriptions made or referred to on the Sites do not constitute an offer by us but an invitation for you to offer. We may withdraw or revise them at any time prior to our express acceptance of your order.
3. Choice of Products. The choice of products, after having studied their features, is made under your sole responsibility and liability according to your needs such as you previously determined them before any order. You are the only person having complete knowledge of equipment, software and configurations that you use and are thus sole judge of the compatibility of the products ordered with those you use. When you confirm your order, you are deemed to have accepted the prices, volumes, quantities and features of the products ordered.
4. Errors. While we make every effort to ensure that the prices and product descriptions indicated on our Sites are accurate, we cannot guarantee the correctness of all information. We reserve the right to notify you of any error relating to a product prior to dispatch of your order. In such event, we convey to you the correct information so you can either (a) confirm your order under the corrected terms or (b) cancel it. If you confirm your order, you acknowledge that the product is provided in accordance with such corrected terms.
5. Availability. We make every effort to ensure that the products appearing on our Sites are available. However, we cannot guarantee that all products are in inventory or in our providers' inventories. If we are unable to process or fulfill your order, we may (a) reject it (without liability), in this case we send you a rejection email and we refund any prior payment that you have made; (b) propose alternative products; or (c) continue to try to source the products from our suppliers for thirty (30) days after your order. If we cannot source the products within this time, we cancel (without liability) your order and send you a cancellation email.
6. Archives - Access. After validation of your order, we may keep, during a fair period, records of orders received, acknowledgements, acceptances and other contracts records. We may potentially be able to provide you with copies on written request. However, you shall print or save a copy of all such documents and this Agreement for your own records.
Price and Transactions:
1. Prices. Prices of products are exclusive of sales taxes or any of the appropriate purchase taxes and exclusive of shipping and freight charges. Such taxes and charges are invoiced, if necessary, once you've specified the necessary information, in addition to the price of the products bought. We may modify the prices at any time and without notice. The prices payable for products are those in effect at the time of our acceptance of your order.
2. Security. On the Sites, credit card transactions are secured and your credit card number is encrypted. We use the 256 bit SSL encryption standard (Secure Socket Layer), currently one of the most reliable standards on the Internet.

1. Address of Delivery. We deliver products only to a correct and existing address.
