FIRST Code of Conduct
Also available as PDF
FIRST organizes several community activities, including conferences, meetings, trainings, workshops, technical colloquia, symposia and social events. FIRST aims to develop a global community of security teams. One of our main goals is for FIRST events to be places where trust is built. As a consequence, our events are intended to be inclusive, open, collaborative and enjoyable to all participants.
This Code of Conduct explains expectations for anyone participating in these events, including delegates, guests and speakers, FIRST staff and all others involved. It applies to physical events, as well as any online events such as video and voice calls, mailing lists and chat channels. The Code of Conduct spells out the types of behavior we support, and do not support. These same behaviors are expected of individuals representing FIRST at third party events.
Expected Behavior
It is expected that participants behave properly and positively at all times. Participants should show respect and courtesy to others and help ensure a safe and inclusive environment.
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders or staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress or violations of this Code of Conduct.
Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
Be respectful of other opinions even if you don’t share them.
All attendees should feel welcome and comfortable to participate fully, therefore we are committed to providing an environment free of the following unacceptable behaviors:
Discrimination of any kind. Some examples include, but are not limited to, discrimination based on a person’s race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social or economic class, educational level, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical ability.
Harassment, including offensive speech, xenophobia, anti-semitism, islamophobia, threats or demands, sharing of sexualized media, stalking, or unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Harassment also includes slights and negative messages, regardless of intent, based solely on appearance (sometimes called microaggressions) in person or on social media.
Misbehavior including disturbance to others or to event proceedings, misuse of property, trespass, theft or other antisocial acts.
Disrespecting confidentiality, e.g. not adhering to Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) labels or posting confidential information outside the intended audience.
Many individuals participate in the FIRST community through their relationship with their employer. As a result, FIRST asks you to refrain from sharing of job opportunities on our public mailing lists or any other of our communications channels. Some sharing of opportunities is always likely to take place in person or at events, and is acceptable. Please use common sense. FIRST may make exceptions for positions and contracting opportunities to support the non-profit organization itself, with the intent that members can share these more widely in their networks.
Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
Posting or displaying sexually explicit, violent or otherwise derogatory material.
Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
Inappropriate photography or recording
Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
Disrespecting local expected behaviour.
Advocating for, or encouraging any of the above behavior.
Consequences
Unacceptable behavior by any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
FIRST expects that breaches of this Code of Conduct can be resolved informally. However, if a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, including temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event) or even involving proper authorities. FIRST reserves the right to ban an attendee or participant violating this Code of Conduct from future FIRST events, which will be made as a decision by the FIRST Board, or by an independent body identified and entrusted by the Board with the task
Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible by visiting the registration desk or emailing conduct@first.org. If one of the community organizers is a potential offender or subject of the report, he will remove him or herself from the investigation.
FIRST may not have a formal presence at all FIRST events, in particular Technical Colloquia, which
are organized by members and partners. In those cases, this alias is monitored by FIRST team
members who have the ability to reach out to local organizers.
Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the FIRST Board via first-board@first.org or any board member personally with a concise description of your grievance.
Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise, sponsors and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

Based to a great degree on the APNIC Code of Conduct, inspired by Citizen Code of Conduct, Django Code of Conduct, Geek Feminism anti-harassment Policy, WordCamp Code of Conduct, and O’Reilly Conferences Code of Conduct with many thanks.
