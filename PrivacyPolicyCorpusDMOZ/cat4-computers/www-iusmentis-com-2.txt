What do they know about me?
Undercover het Web op (in Dutch)
Sometimes you want to send something without having your real name
attached to it. For example, you are an official spokesperson for a
company, and now you want to say something "off the record". Or maybe
you want to discuss something that is going on in your company,
without identifying yourself as the sender of the message. Perhaps
you just don't want your boss to find out you are posting to
alt.sex.bondage during working time.
Simply changing or clearing the "Real Name" field in your newsreader
setup won't help you much in those cases. It's still trivial to trace
a message back to its originating site, and of course the system
administrator there can easily look up the sender's real name.
A better solution is to use an anonymous remailer. These systems
either give you an anonymous address, to which other people can send
you mail, which is then forwarded to your real address (this is
sometimes referred to as a pseudonymous server), or they post or mail
your message without any trace of the sender's name or address.
