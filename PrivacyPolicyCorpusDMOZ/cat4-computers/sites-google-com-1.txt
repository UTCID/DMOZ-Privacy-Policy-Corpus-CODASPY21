google.public.support.general FAQ
Introduction
This article includes answers to questions that appeared especially
frequently in the old Google newsgroup google.public.support.general.
This newsgroup has been replaced by other official Google forums and
Google employees no longer post here and it may be full of spam if
you visit it. The web version of the FAQ is still kept for its useful
information and might still get updated sometimes. And of course the
monthly posted newsgroup versions are still available. This FAQ is not
intended to replace Google's official FAQs and information for
webmasters. Please read them if you haven't already done so.

1. GOOGLE WEB SEARCH
====================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I clear information about my previous searches?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Depending on what web browser you use, your previous searches can be
saved as form information, history information and cache information.
See questions "How do I stop my previous searches from appearing when
I type in a new search term?", "How do I clear the history information
of previously visited web pages?" (see the next two questions), and
"How can I empty the browser's cache?" (see section 6).
If you have Google Toolbar installed, see also question "How can I
clear the search history in Google Toolbar?" (see section 5).
If you are using the Google Web History service, go to page
http://www.google.com/searchhistory/ and sign in, so you can remove
previous searches if you have saved any searches.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I stop my previous searches from appearing when I type in a
new search term?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Some web browsers save information you type into web pages (known as
form information). Instructions for some web browsers:
If you are using Internet Explorer 6, click "Tools", select "Internet
Options", click "Content" tab, push "AutoComplete", and uncheck
"Forms". To clear previous searches, push "Clear Forms". You can also
delete search queries one by one: empty the Google Search Field and
double-click on it to see the earlier search queries, and delete
individual searches by moving the mouse cursor (or use Down arrow key)
over one of the search queries and press Delete key on keyboard.
http://www.google.com/help/faq.html#iehistory
http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=465&topic=352
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/customizing/autocomplete.mspx
If you are using Internet Explorer 7, click "Tools", select "Internet
Options", click "General" tab, push "Delete...", push "Delete
forms...", and then "Yes" button. If you want to remove individual
search queries, see instructions for Internet Explorer 6 above.
If you have a program that uses Internet Explorer, such as another
browser or an add-on for Internet Explorer (for example MSN Explorer,
Avant Browser, or Maxthon Browser), see the instructions for Internet
Explorer above. You may need to close that browser or add-on before
clearing the form information.
If you have Mozilla Firefox 0.x or 1.x, click "Tools", select
"Options", click "Privacy", click "+" next to "Saved Form
Information", and uncheck "Save information I enter in web page forms
and the Search Bar". To clear previous searches, push "Clear" next to
"Saved Form Information". If you have Mozilla Firefox 0.9 or above,
you can also delete search queries one by one: empty the Google Search
Field and double-click on it to see the earlier search queries (or use
Down arrow key), and delete individual searches by moving the mouse
cursor (or use Down arrow key) over one of the search queries and
press Shift + Delete on keyboard (press Shift key and keep it pressed,
then press Delete key once and release it, finally release Shift key).
If you have Mozilla Firefox 2.x, click "Tools", select "Options",
click "Privacy", click "Clear Now...", check "Saved Form and Search
History", push "Clear Private Data Now" button.
If you are using Netscape 8, at the top part of the Netscape browser
window there should a Location bar (also called address field). Type
about:config into the Location bar (and press Enter). Now you should
see a text field (also called a text box) right to text "Filter:".
Type browser.formfill.enable to the text field. Now you should see
under the text field "browser.formfill.enable". Double-click it to
change it from value true to false. You can also delete search queries
one by one: empty the Google Search Field and double-click on it to
see the earlier search queries (or use Down arrow key), and delete
individual searches by moving the mouse cursor (or use Down arrow key)
over one of the search queries and press Shift + Delete on keyboard
(press Shift key and keep it pressed, then press Delete key once and
release it, finally release Shift key).
If you are using Netscape 8 in Windows, and you want to use Internet
Explorer engine for Google, you can also do this: go to the main page
of Google (you can do the same procedure for the national domains of
Google, for example google.co.uk), and if the icon at the bottom left
corner of the Netscape browser window looks like a Mozilla icon, click
it and select "Display Like Internet Explorer" so Netscape uses
Internet Explorer's AutoComplete mechanism to save form information.
Now you can go to Internet Explorer, and empty or disable the
AutoComplete information from Internet Explorer, by selecting "Tools",
"Internet Options", "Content", and "AutoComplete".
From JB (jtb5358@yahoo.com):
If you're using Safari on a Macintosh:
In the "Safari" menu, choose
"Preferences..." and click on the "AutoFill" tab.
Uncheck the "Other
Forms" box to stop all autofilling.
If you do want to keep
autofilling forms on certain web sites, click the "Edit" button and
add those sites to the list.
In the Mac version of Firefox, go to the "Firefox" menu, and choose
"Preferences", then "Privacy", then "Saved Form Information".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I clear the history information of previously visited
web pages?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Instructions for some web browsers on how to clear history
information:
If you are using Internet Explorer 6, click "Tools", select "Internet
Options", push "Clear History" button. If you don't want documents to
be added to the history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Days to keep
pages in history". If you want to remove individual documents in
history, click the "History" button in Standard Buttons toolbar,
right-click a web site or a document and select "Delete" (you may need
to add the "History" button to the Standard Buttons toolbar:
right-click the toolbar, select "Customize...", and add the "History"
button from "Available toolbar buttons" section to "Current toolbar
buttons" section).
If you are using Internet Explorer 7, click "Tools", select "Internet
Options", click "General" tab, push "Delete...", push "Delete
history...", and then "Yes" button.
If you have a program that uses Internet Explorer, such as another
browser or an add-on for Internet Explorer (for example MSN Explorer,
Avant Browser, or Maxthon Browser), see the instructions for Internet
Explorer above. You may need to close that browser or add-on before
clearing history.
If you have Mozilla Firefox 0.x or 1.x, click "Tools", select
"Options...", click "Privacy", click "History", push "Clear" (Firefox
0.x or 1.x) button or "Clear Browsing History Now" (Firefox 1.5.x)
button. In Firefox 1.5.x if you don't want documents to be added to
the history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Remember visited pages
for the last" ... "days". If you want to remove individual documents
in history, click the "History" button in Navigation Toolbar,
right-click a folder or a document and select "Delete" (you may need
to add the "History" button to the Navigation Toolbar: right-click the
toolbar, select "Customize...", and drag the "History" button to the
toolbar).
If you have Mozilla Firefox 2.x, click "Tools", select "Options",
click "Privacy", click "Clear Now...", check "Browsing History",
push "Clear Private Data Now" button.
If you have Mozilla (Mozilla Suite) 1.x, click "Edit", select
"Preferences...", expand "Navigator", click "History", push "Clear
History" button. If you don't want web documents to be added to the
history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Remember visited pages for
the last" ... "days". You may need to close the browser to get the
history cleared.
If you have Netscape Navigator (Communicator) 4.x, click "Edit",
select "Preferences...", click "Navigator", push "Clear History"
("Expire Now" on Mac OS). If you don't want documents to be added to
the history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Pages in history expire
after" ("Visited links expire" on Mac OS). If you want to remove
individual documents in history, click "Communicator", select "Tools",
select "History" and in History window right-click a document and
select "Delete".
If you have Netscape 7.x, click "Edit", select "Preferences...", click
"Navigator", push "Clear History". If you don't want documents to be
added to the history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Remember
visited pages for the last" ... "days". If you want to remove
individual documents in history, click "Go", select "History" and in
History window right-click a folder, a web site or a document and
select "Delete".
If you have Netscape Browser 8.x, click "Tools", select "Options...",
click "Privacy", expand "Page History", push "Clear". If you don't
want documents to be added to the history, change the value to 0
(zero) in "Remember visited pages for the last" ... "days". If you
want to remove individual documents in history, click "Go", select
"History" and in History section right-click a folder, a web site or a
document and select "Delete".
If you have Opera 8.x or 9.x, click "Tools", select "Preferences...",
"Advanced", "History", click "Clear" button next to "Typed in
addresses" and "Visited addresses" (Opera 8) or click "Clear" button
next to "Addresses" (Opera 9). If you don't want web documents to be
added to the history, change the value to 0 (zero) in "Typed in
addresses" and "Visited addresses" (Opera 8) or "Addresses" (Opera 9).
If you want to remove individual documents in history, click "Tools",
select "History", and in History window right-click a document and
select "Delete".

Q:
My computer began to behave strangely. Why?
Q:
Why am I getting redirected to other search engines when I try to
go to Google, or click on Google search results?
Q:
Why am I getting all these popups from Google?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You have probably inadvertently downloaded and installed adware,
spyware, parasite, trojan, a browser hijacker or a virus from some web
site.
One quick scan with only one spyware remover using an old spyware
database probably won't find all the spyware, so install, update and
use all of the below free (or trial version) programs with the full
scan option even though it can take hours before you have used them
all: CWShredder, Ad-aware, Spybot - Search & Destroy, SpywareBlaster,
RapidBlaster Killer, SpyRemover, Spy Sweeper, and Windows Defender:

Use a virus scanner also. Here are some free virus scanners (if you

Be careful what to remove. If you are uncertain what to remove with
the programs or you can't get rid of the problem, send your HijackThis
log file to a spyware/security forum for assistance:

Malware may reside in your computer's memory and disable or fool your
security software, so to effectively remove malware from your computer
you may need start Windows in Safe Mode, which means you need to tap
continually the F8 key when your computer begins to boot until you see
a menu where you can select Safe Mode:
http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chsafe.htm
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc787501.aspx
To prevent new spyware to be installed to your computer, update your
Windows frequently to remove the latest security holes so there's a
smaller probability to get new spyware to your computer:

Use an up-to-date virus scanner and a firewall.
Avoid using disreputable spyware tools (some of them might even
install more spyware to your computer):
http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm
Make browsing the web pages safer by disabling features such as
scripting, Java and ActiveX, see question "How can I adjust the
settings of my web browser to make browsing the web pages safer?".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why can't I access Google or some other search engines?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Sometimes browser's full cache memory can cause various problems. Try
to clear browser's cache memory and then reload the web page (see
section 6).
If that doesn't help, try to search for spyware from your computer,
which can prevent you from accessing some web sites (see question
above).
If that doesn't help either, then your ISP (internet service provider)
might have DNS or some other problems. You could contact your ISP if
the problem persists.
If there is only one search engine you can't access (for example
Google), you might want to contact that search engine company, because
it might have for example DNS problems.
If you can't use your Gmail account, look at the Gmail section in this
FAQ.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I adjust the settings of my web browser to make browsing
the web pages safer?

"Trust Settings" tab, select "I Trust This Site", push "Done".
If you are using Opera 8 or 9, select "Tools", "Preferences...", click
"Advanced" tab, select "Content", uncheck "Enable JavaScript", and
"Enable Java". Some sites you are using may need for example scripting
so if you think you can trust a site (for example your bank or a
search engine), you may need to allow for example JavaScript: go to
"Tools", "Preferences", "Advanced", "Content", "Manage site
preferences" and edit (or add) the settings for the site you trust:
select the site, push "Edit", click "Scripting" tab, check "Enable
JavaScript", push "OK", "Close", and "OK".
If you are using HotJava Browser 3, select "Edit", "Security
Preferences...", select "Advanced", click "Applets and JavaScript",
uncheck "Enable Applets", and "Enable JavaScript". Click "OK". Some
sites you are using may need for example scripting so if you think you
can trust a site, you may need to allow for example JavaScript while
you visit a web site you trust (for example your bank or a search
engine).

Q:
How do I report spam to Google?
A:
From Martin Hagstrøm (mha@altavista.net):
Google is not the Internet Police, but in cases where SPAM lowers the
quality of Google's results (e.g. misleading titles) you may report
them. Either use this URL:
http://www.google.com/contact/spamreport.html
or click the link at the bottom of the search results that says
"Dissatisfied with your search results? Help us improve".
Note:
Don't expect immediate results.
Google prefers to use the data
to help them develop better algorithms that improve results overall,
instead of playing "whack-a-mole" with individual sites.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why doesn't a "link:" search show all my backlinks?
A:
From Craig Payne (cbpayne@gmail.com):
Google have never shown all the links to a site. They have only ever
shown a "sample". Previously the criteria for being in the sample was
a PR threshold (probably a very high 3). Now there are other criteria
to be in the sample
ncluding a PR threshold - but it is not clear
what the criteria is ...
Google still takes all links into account when calculating PR, even
though they do not show in the backlinks sample.
Google do not show them for what could be any number of reasons eg to
prevent reverse engineering of the PR algorithm; to save on computing
resources; etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why does [link: your.url] (with a space) give me more results than
[link:your.url] ?
A:
From Martin Hagstrøm (mha@altavista.net):
The former command will find: all pages that mention your site and
contain the word "link". + some of the pages that link to your site
and contain the word "link".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I stop being redirected from www.google.com to other Google
pages?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google redirects you by probably using geotargeting, which usually
means detecting your geographical location based on your IP address
and on an IP-to-country database, which aren't 100 % accurate. Also,
inaccuracies can happen if you are using a proxy.
To stop being redirected from www.google.com to other national Google
sites (for example to www.google.co.uk), try to click the link "Go to
Google.com" (or similar) on the national Google main page or go to
page http://www.google.com/ncr
If that doesn't help, your cookies might be corrupted, so try to
delete your cookies for Google. Also, make sure you still allow
cookies for Google:
http://www.google.com/help/faq.html#eng_home
If you can't or don't want to allow cookies for Google, you can use
one of the below pages and save it to your web browser's bookmarks
(favorites):
http://www.google.com/webhp
http://www.google.com/intl/en/
If you don't mind being redirected, but you are redirected to an
incorrect national Google domain, you can contact Google:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I change the language Google uses on its web pages?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You can change your language setting on page
http://www.google.com/preferences
You may need to change the language settings for the international
Google domain (google.com) and for your local/national Google domain
(for example google.co.uk).
If you are using a Gmail account, try changing the language setting
for your Gmail account also ("Settings", "General", "Language").
If that doesn't help, your cookies might be corrupted, so try to
delete your cookies for Google. Also, make sure your web browser and
security software still allow cookies for Google:
http://www.google.com/help/faq.html#eng_home
If you can't or don't want to allow cookies for Google, you should
find a language interface for your language (if one exists) on page
http://www.google.com/language_tools
You could also try to move up your preferred language (you may need to
add that language first) in the language settings of your browser. If
you have Internet Explorer 7, select "Tools", "Internet Options",
click the "General" tab, and press the "Languages" button. If you have
Mozilla Firefox 2, select "Tools", "Options...", "Advanced", and press
the "Choose..." button under the "Languages" heading. If you have
Opera 9, select "Tools", "Preferences...", click the "General" tab,
and press the "Details..." button near the "Languages" heading.
http://www.google.com/help/faq.html#display
If you can't see the characters for your language correctly try a
different character encoding in your web browser (for example
"Western", "Unicode", "ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", etc.). If you have
Internet Explorer 7, select "View" and "Encoding". If you have Mozilla
Firefox 2, select "View", and "Character Encoding". If you have Opera
9, select "View", and "Encoding".
If you still can't see the characters for your language correctly, you
may need to install the correct language files for your operating
system. If you have the Windows operating system, push "Start" button,
select "Settings", select "Control Panel", double-click "Regional and
Language Options", click the "Languages" tab. There you may need to
select "Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages
(including Thai)" or "Install files for East Asian languages". The
settings in different Windows versions may differ. Also, you probably
need to have administrator rights for your computer and the Windows
installation disc.

Q:
How can I save preferences for Google?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Allow cookies for Google.
If you can't or don't want to allow cookies for Google, try Method A
or Method B.
Method A
--------
1. Go to http://www.google.com/ and click "Advanced Search" (or
similar) button on that page.
2. Choose the settings you want to use (search language, number of
results per page, etc.) and click "Advanced Search" (or similar) button.
3. Because you can't or don't want to allow cookies for Google, you
may want to bookmark the resulting page so you can use Google with
those preferences again the next time you use Google.
Method B
--------
Another way to change the settings is by modifying the below URL:
http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=ISO-8859-1&newwindow=1&safe=active&output=search
As you can see, the interface language is English (hl=en), the search
language is any language (lr=), SafeSearch is set to strict filtering
(safe=active), number of search results per page is 100 (num=100),
and search results will be opened to new windows (newwindow=1).
The interface language code (hl=) can be found by going to
http://www.google.com/language_tools and clicking one of the links
under the "Use the Google Interface in Your Language" (or similar)
headline and looking at the URL. For example, if you click "English"
(or similar) link, you will be directed to
http://www.google.com/intl/en/ where the code is "en" for English.
The search language (lr=lang_) setting has less codes than the
interface language setting and can be changed by placing the language
code after the lang_. For example lang_en is for English.
You can find a list of the interface language codes (hl=) and search
language (lr=lang_) codes here:
http://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-language-codes
The number of search results per page setting can be 10 (num=10),
20 (num=20), 30 (num=30), 50 (num=50) or 100 (num=100).
The SafeSearch setting can be strict (safe=active), disabled
(safe=off) or moderate (remove the safe=xxx part from the URL).
The open search results to new windows can be on (openednewwindow=1)
or off (remove the openednewwindow=xxx part from the URL).
After you have modified the URL, remember to press Enter, Return, etc.
for the changes to take effect.
When you are happy with the URL, you could bookmark it for future use.

Q:
How can I allow cookies for Google?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Check the settings for your web browser and for your security software
(virus scanner, firewall, ad blocker, etc.), which may block or delete
your cookies. Instructions for some web browsers on how to allow
cookies:
If you are using Internet Explorer 6 or 7, click "Tools", select
"Internet Options", click "Privacy" tab, and see what setting you have
for cookies. If the setting for cookies is "Block All Cookies", you
can't allow cookies for Google or any other website. If you are
willing to receive cookies, change to some other setting, for example
"High", and click "OK". Now you can allow cookies for google.com:
click "Tools", select "Internet Options", click "Privacy" tab, push
"Edit" (IE6) or "Sites" (IE7), type google.com in the field and push
"Allow", "OK" and "OK".
If you have Mozilla Firefox 0.x or 1.x, click "Tools", select
"Options...", click "Privacy", select "Cookies", push "Exceptions",
type google.com in the field, push "Allow", "OK", and "OK".
If you have Mozilla Firefox 2.x, click "Tools", select "Options...",
click "Privacy", push "Exceptions", type google.com in the field, push
"Allow", "Close", and "OK".
If you have Mozilla 1.x (Mozilla Suite), click "Edit", select
"Preferences...", select "Privacy & Security", select "Cookies", push
"Cookie Manager", click "Cookie Sites" tab, type google.com in the
field, push "Allow", push "Close", and "OK".
If you have Netscape 4.x, click "Edit", select "Preferences...",
select "Advanced". Select "Accept all cookies" or "Accept only
cookies that get sent back to the originating server". You might
also want to check "Warn me before accepting a cookie". Push "OK".
If you have Netscape 7, click "Edit", select "Preferences...", select
"Privacy & Security", select "Cookies", and see what setting you have
for cookies. If the setting for cookies is "Disable cookies", you
can't allow cookies for Google or any other website. If you are
willing to receive cookies, change to some other setting, for example
"Enable cookies for the originating web site only", and click "OK".
If that doesn't help, then you might have accidently blocked cookies
for google.com. To see if that has happened, click "Edit", select
"Preferences...", select "Privacy & Security", select "Cookies", push
"Manage Stored Cookies", click "Cookie Sites" tab, click
www.google.com, and push "Remove Site".
If you have Opera 8, you might have to first empty the cache: click
"Tools", select "Preferences...", select "Advanced", click "History",
push "Empty now", and "OK" (you might have to do this a few times).
Then you can enable cookies: click "Tools", select "Preferences...",
click "Cookies", and under text "Normal cookies" select "Let me decide
every time I receive one", or "Accept all cookies". If you select
"Treat as specified in Server Manager", then also push "Manage
cookies...", push "New...", type google.com, check "Apply these
settings for entire domain" and "Accept cookies for server/domain",
push "OK", push "Close", and do the same for the national Google
domain (for example google.co.uk).

Q:
How do I search for special characters like &, %, #, @, $, £, €,
+, -, /, *, =, <, {, [, (, ), ], }, >, :, ;, !, ?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google doesn't support special characters very well, because it
ignores most of them in search queries. Try different search tactics
with different keyword combinations.
But Google does allow some uses of special characters:
You can search for I/O.
You can search for notes: A_, A#, B_, B#, C_, C#, D_, D#, E_, E#, F_,
F#, G_, G#.
You can use &, + and _ one or more times in the middle or at the end
of a character or a word or between characters and words: A+, a_, C++,
net__, page_count, i++++, a&b&c, i&&, "Health +& Human", "&& year".
But you can't use + in front of a word or a character: +i, "++number".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Can I make a proximity search with Google?
Q:
Can I use wildcard symbols in searches?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You can only use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard symbol in a phrase
search so that each asterisk replaces one word. For example search for
"1 * 3" can give results like "1 2 3", "1 1 3", "1 and 3", "1 to 3",
etc. Search for "one * * four" can give results like "one, two, three,
four", "one out of four", "one of top four", and so on.

Q:
What is Cached page?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
A Cached page is a "snapshot" of a page when Google crawled and
archived it. A Cached page can be viewed if the original web server is
having problems showing the current version of the page.

================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I change my name that appears every time I want to post or
reply with Google Groups?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
If you want to change the name Google Groups suggests when you
subscribe to a Usenet newsgroup or to a Google discussion group, go
to http://groups.google.com/ and sign in. Then click the "Profile" link
in the top right-hand corner and click the "edit" link next to the
"My profile" text.
If you want to change your name for one or for all the groups you
have already subscribed to, go to http://groups.google.com/ and sign
in. Then click "My Groups" and click "Manage my memberships" link
below the list of groups you have subscribed to.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I automatically quote messages in Google Groups?
Q:
What quoting styles and techniques can I use?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Click "More options", "Reply". In Google Groups web interface you can
find "More options" link next to the date of the message. If you click
"More options", Google Groups will show you more information about the
message and more options. One of the options is the "Reply" link, and
if you click it, Google Groups will add greater than ">" signs to the
beginning of the text lines of the quoted article as a way to
distinguish the quoted text from your own text.
You can use three well-known quotation styles: top posting, bottom
posting or interleaved posting (trimmed posting).
Top posting means you type your answer before the original text.
Bottom posting means you type your reply after the original text. In
interleaved posting you type your text in between the original text
and trim out unnecessary text. Trimming saves the time of all the
other people when they only need to read the text necessary to
understand which part of your text is a response to which part of the
original text you reply to.
Many people prefer interleaved posting, because in many languages you
read the text from top to bottom so it is logical that the reply is at
the bottom of the message and it is easy to follow the discussion when
the answer is immediately after the quoted question. An interleaved
and trimmed answer could look like this:

You can get a Google account by going to
https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount and following the
instructions on that page
Ellie Expert
Also, keep in mind that some people read the discussions via email and
they might get a lot of email daily and they may want to delete old
messages from their computers so they don't might have the option to
see the previous messages so if you are replying to a message and you
don't quote anything from the original message it can be difficult to
find out who is replying to whom and what was the original question.
Notice that the Google Groups web interface doesn't support discussion
board tags such as [quote] [/quote] or <blockquote> </blockquote> used
for example in BBCode, Ikonboard, phpBB, vBulletin, WWWBoard, and
YaBB. Instead, discussion board codes are shown as they are without
any special effects.

Q:
How can I change my email address in Google Groups?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Go to https://www.google.com/accounts/ and sign in. Then click "My
Account" and click "Change email".
If you don't see the link "Change email", then you might have Gmail
address in which case you need to create a new Google account for the
new email address. (You could click the link "Delete Gmail Service",
on page https://www.google.com/accounts/EditServices but it's risky,
because you might want to use the Gmail address later and there can
be problems if you delete it.)

Q:
How can I check the threads on what I post?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I respond to a post over 60 days old?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
If you are using a Usenet newsgroup with Google Groups, you shouldn't
reply to old newsgroup posts, because many newsgroup users can't see
messages older than a few weeks, because they are using newsreaders,
which receive only the newest newsgroup articles from newsservers.
But if you still want to discuss about an old subject, it is wise to
create a new thread and to take some points from the original thread
with your thoughts included so people using newsreaders will know what
you are talking about.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How many newsgroups are there?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
The authoritative file listed over 45,000 "official" newsgroups on
January 2007. There are also some newsgroups, which aren't on the
list:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
What is DejaNews?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
DejaNews was a Usenet archive, which was acquired by Google in
February 2001:
http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease48.html
http://groups.google.com/googlegroups/deja_syntax.html
DejaNews was replaced by Google Groups 1 (GG1), which was replaced
by Google Groups 2 (GG2), which was replaced by Google Groups 3 (GG3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Is Google Groups a message board?
Q:
Are Google discussion groups same as Usenet newsgroups?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google Groups is not only a message board. Google Groups is a Usenet
archive, which contained more than 845 million archived newsgroup
messages in February 2004. Archived newsgroup messages date back to
year 1981 (Usenet was created in 1979).
In addition to reading and posting to Usenet newsgroups, you can also
create your own Google discussion groups. Google discussion groups
are different from Usenet groups, because you can read Usenet
newsgroups with a newsreader (and also with Google Groups), but you
can't read Google discussion groups with a newsreader.

Q:
Why does it take so long for my post to show up in Google Groups?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
There are over 45,000 newsgroups, and Google Groups archives many of
them (over 35,000). Google Groups has newsgroup messages dating back
to 1981 and there are over 845 million messages in the archive. That
is a huge amount of information to deal with. In addition to Usenet
newsgroups, Google Groups also archives Google discussion groups:

Q:
I have a question about my site. Can you help me without me
giving the URL of my site?

Q:
My web site has never been indexed by Google. Why?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Check out with site search [site:your.site] is your site really not
indexed by Google. If it isn't, here are some possible reasons why
your site isn't indexed:
* Your site is new. It takes time to get indexed.
* There are no web pages indexed by Google linking to your web site.
* Your web site is not accessible to search engine spiders.
* You are using spamming techniques.
* You are linking to web sites that use spamming techniques.
* Previous owner of your site got your domain name banned.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
My new site appeared in the Google results for a few days, but now
it has disappeared. Why?
A:
From Martin Hagstrøm (mha@altavista.net):
New sites are picked up by the Google FreshBot, but they are dropped a
few days later. It may take several weeks before your site is
permanently included in Google. One reason is that Google keeps copies
of its index on several different data centers, and whenever you
search, you may get connected to a different data center.
It takes a
while to update all the data centers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why is it that some days my site is listed (lately in the top
position) and on other days it isn't?
A:
From Craig Payne (cbpayne@gmail.com):
they may be tweaking algorithms; they maybe temporarily reverting to
old indexes at some datacenters; they maybe brining in missing
backlinks for some sites; they maybe testing spam filters; they
maybe....; is there a full moon tonight?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why isn't my web site on the first page of search results (my web
site is indexed by Google)?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
There is a lot of competition especially for popular keywords. For
example on February 23, 2006 there were about 1,910,000,000 documents
containing the word 'Google' in the index of Google Web Search:
http://www.google.com/search?&q=Google
People usually look at the top 10 search results for a search query.
That is only about 0.0000005 % of all the search results for search
[Google]:
http://www.google.com/search?&q=10+%2F+1910000000
Google doesn't show more than about 1,000 search results for a search.
That is only about 0.00005 % of all the search results for search
[Google]:
http://www.google.com/search?&q=1000+%2F+1910000000
So you might have a very low probability to be seen on the first page
of search results especially for a popular search term.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I determine if my web pages are in the Google index?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Your web pages should be in the index if you can find some of your
pages with one of these searches: ["Title of your page"] or [keywords
on your page] or [URL of your page] or [site:your.domain] or
[link:your.url].
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
I can't find anymore any web pages of my site. Is it banned?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You shouldn't be banned if you can find some of your pages with one
of these searches: [site:your.domain] or [link:your.url].
If there are no web pages in Google's index that link to your web
site, Google might remove your web site from the index (that doesn't
mean your site is banned, it means your site doesn't seem to be
important, because no page links to your pages). One way to try to
find out are there web pages in Google's index linking to your web
site is to search with Google for your site inside quotes, for example
"your.site":
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22your.site%22
Some pages might mention your web site, but do they also link to your
web site?
One reason might be you have changed your web site so that search
engine spiders can't access your web site anymore. See question "Can
search engine spiders access my web site?".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
I'm quite sure by site is banned. How can I get it back to Google
search results?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Clean up your web site from possible spamming techniques. After that
send a re-inclusion request to Google. It can take some time. You need
to create a sitemap file, which can be for example a text file, HTML
file or an XML file containing URLs (and possibly other information)
for the main or even all the public pages on your web site. You also
need to create a Google Webmaster Tools account (if you don't already
have one) at http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/. Then you need to
submit the sitemap file to your Google Webmaster Tools account. After
your sitemap file has been accepted, log in to Google Webmaster Tools
and select the "Request reconsideration" link and follow the
instructions. More info:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I submit my site to Google?
A:
From Martin Hagstrøm (mha@altavista.net):
You could use this URL: http://www.google.com/addurl.html. But
generally it's best to let Google find your site by having some other
sites point to yours.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Will my site be banned if I submit it too often?
A:
From Martin Hagstrøm (mha@altavista.net):
No, That would make it too easy to get your competition's site banned
;-) But again: there's really no need to submit your site to Google.
Let Google find it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why do I need incoming links pointing to my web site?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Because Google doesn't have enough employees to check all the over 1
trillion (1,000,000,000,000) URLs indexed by Google every day, Google
uses search engine spiders and spam recognition algorithms instead:
http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html
Here's an illustrational example calculation:
If one Google employee would check every single URL in the index 8
hours a day using one minute per document, it would take over five
million years:
http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%281000000000000+minutes%29+%2F+%288+hours+%2F+day%29+in+years
Google had 10,674 employees on December 31, 2006:
http://www.google.com/corporate/history.html#2007
If everyone of the 10,674 employees would use 8 hours a day checking
those trillion documents, it would take over 500 years until the job
was done:
http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%281000000000000+minutes+%2F+10674%29+%2F+%288+hours+%2F+day%29+in+years
But those web pages need to be checked more often than only once every
500 years. Preferably every day.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why don't the keywords in my meta tags have any effect?
A:
From JB (jtb5358@yahoo.com):
Google ignores the "keywords" meta tag because it's too easy to spam
with it.
So do most other search engines, by the way.
Google *does*
use the "description" meta tag sometimes, I think when it contains
exactly the keywords being searched for, *and* those keywords are also
visible on the page in the body text, title, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
We have a new version of our website, but when you search in
Google for information about our website, the search result still
points to the old web pages. What would be the process to have the
search pointing at the new website pages?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google advises to use an HTTP 301 permanent redirect from the old site
to the new site:
http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=34444
Depends on your webhost what you can do. Contact your webhost and read
about 301 redirects:
http://www.google.com/search?&q=301+redirect
http://www.seocompany.ca/seo/url-redirect.html
http://www.tamingthebeast.net/articles3/spiders-301-redirect.htm
Warning: don't use an HTTP 302 temporary redirect:
http://www.mcanerin.com/EN/articles/301-redirect-apache.asp
http://seotoday.com/seo-tips/the-rundown-on-301-and-302-redirects
Use an HTTP response viewer (see question "Are there any SEO tools?")
to make sure you are using the correct redirect.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Does Google index dynamic pages?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Yes, Google does index dynamic pages, but Google still prefers static
pages over dynamic pages. There also are some restrictions and
problems:
The more parameters a page has in the URL, the less probably it will
get indexed by Google.
Also session IDs can cause problems, as most of your pages might end
up in supplemental results and rank poorly as Google doesn't like
duplicate content and it is difficult for Google to know are you
creating duplicate pages on purpose or by accident as the same page
can have many URLs as in this imaginary example where there are many
URLs for the same example.html page:
hxxp://your.site.com/dynamic/example.html?sessionid=a_BrNylSYB5o_2BIQa
hxxp://your.site.com/dynamic/example.html?sessionid=axQSWD5Lp_7-QrT5Py
hxxp://your.site.com/dynamic/example.html?sessionid=aL7YVtEm_1I7nLQN-w
You could disable session IDs, but if you are using for example a
shopping cart functionality you need to save visitor information. You
could use cookies instead of session IDs to save session information,
but some people disable cookies.
That's why you could create different versions of your pages. You
could create pages without session IDs intended only for search engine
bots and pages with session IDs for your customers and keep your pages
with session IDs in their own directory. Then you could tell search
engine bots not to crawl pages with session IDs using a robots.txt
file for example with lines like (in case the dynamic pages are in
directory 'dynamic'):
User-Agent: *
Disallow: /dynamic/
Yet another solution is to identify search engine bots by their
User-Agent string and turn sessions IDs off only for them. In that
case remember to check that your solution works.

Q:
Does Google crawl JavaScript?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Yes, Google can crawl JavaScript for complete (clean) URLs. Because
some search engines may not see links in JavaScript at all and there
are people who have disabled JavaScript, you could create a static
sitemap file with links to your other pages so search engine bots
should more probably be able to find more pages on your site.

Q:
Someone copied my entire website. What should I do now?
A:
From Craig Payne (cbpayne@gmail.com):
You have a case under the Digital Millenium Copyright act. Here is
what you do:
1) Burn a screen shot of your site and his site to a CD. Post this to
yourself registered/certified mail. Do not open it. This can be used
as evidence at a later date.
2) Write him (or preferably from your lawyer) a cease and desist
letter - tell them about step one (this makes it sound you are
serious)
3) Write to his ISP (preferably from your lawyer) - give them 48hrs to
take the site down or they will be named as a party to legal action re
copyright(tell them about step one)
4) Lodge a complaint with Google under the DMCA:
http://www.google.com/dmca.html
5) Court action is too expensive, but at least step one makes you
sound serious.
6) If you want to get nasty - send a nice email all those sites that
link to him telling them what a scumbag he is and that they should not
link to such a low life (this will affect his Google rankings)

Q:
How search engine spiders see my web pages?
Q:
Can search engine spiders access my web site?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Use a search engine simulator or a text only web browser such as lynx
to find out how search engine spiders see your web site and can they
access your web site.
Search engine simulators:
http://www.pagerank.net/search-engine-simulator/
http://www.webconfs.com/search-engine-spider-simulator.php
lynx:
http://lynx.browser.org/
One way is to use Amaya (uncheck all options in "Special",
"Preferences", "Browsing"):
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
Or disable at least JavaScript and cookies in your web browser, see
question "How can I adjust the settings of my web browser to make
browsing the web pages safer?".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I help my web site rank higher on a national Google
search for a certain country?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google looks at the IP address and TLD (top-level domain) of your web
site, so host your server in the country for which you want to rank
high for and/or use a country-specific TLD (e.g. uk).
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:
What is Google Dance?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
When Google's index was updated about once a month, the Google data
centers displayed different search results for the same search for a
few days until the update settled. Because search results were varying
from server to server, the search results were "dancing". And that's
where the term "Google Dance" comes from. In mid-2003 Google started
to update the index continuously. It seems that an update of the
complete index still happens once in a while.

cause problems for web spiders (you might want avoid those
technologies on the first page of your site)
- if you create a fake web site (web site with no real content humans
would read, for example fake "directory" pages or fake "article"
pages with nothing for humans to be read, except advertisements or
links to advertisement pages) just to make money using Google
AdSense and/or affiliate programs, your web site might get banned by
Google
Avoid:
- avoid HTML errors
- avoid spelling errors
- avoid broken links
- avoid keyword stuffing
- avoid too high keyword density
- avoid hidden text or hidden links

- avoid doorway pages created just for search engines
- avoid suspicious SEO firms
- avoid link farms, and suspicious link-sharing programs
- avoid linking to web spammers
- don't send automated queries to Google
Advanced:
- use keywords on titles, headings, URLs, and beginnings of pages
- use descriptive and accurate title and alt elements
- learn more about robots.txt, log files, validation, HTML, CSS, SEO

4. GOOGLE DIRECTORY
===================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I get my site listed in Google Directory?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google Directory at http://directory.google.com/ uses the data from
DMOZ (Open Directory Project). Submit your site to DMOZ. See these
instructions:
http://www.dmoz.org/add.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How do I change the description of my site in Google Directory?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google Directory uses the data from DMOZ (Open Directory Project).
Submit the change using the DMOZ "update URL" link:
http://www.dmoz.org/help/update.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
When is Google Directory updated next?
A:
From Craig Payne (cbpayne@gmail.com):
Google only updated the Directory 8 times in 2002 and 2 times in 2003
(the last being early November) - so the next one is anyones guess.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
=================
5. GOOGLE TOOLBAR
=================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
I have installed Google Toolbar. Where is it?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
1. Use the correct web browser: you can see Google Toolbar only in
Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. Following instructions are for
the Internet Explorer version of the Google Toolbar:
2. In Internet Explorer select "Tools", click "Internet Options",
click "Advanced" tab, check "Enable third-party browser extensions".
If you still don't see the Google Toolbar, in Internet Explorer select
"View", click "Toolbars", and select "Google". If you see the Google
Toolbar, you can select "View", click "Toolbars" and select "Lock the
Toolbars" so you should see the Google Toolbar all the time in
Internet Explorer.
3. If the above instructions don't help, uninstall and reinstall the
Google Toolbar. To uninstall the Google Toolbar, push the green
"Settings" button (it should be at the right side of the toolbar),
select "Help", select "Uninstall...". Or in Windows, select "Start",
select "Settings", click "Control Panel", double-click "Add/Remove
Programs". Find "Google Toolbar" (or similar) from the list, push the
"Remove" button (or similar). Reboot your computer and reinstall the
Google Toolbar from http://toolbar.google.com and repeat step 2.
4. If even reinstalling Google Toolbar won't help, then you might have
spyware, which can hide or disable the Google Toolbar. See question
"My computer began to behave strangely. Why?" for instructions on
how to remove spyware.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I clear the search history in Google Toolbar?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Click the "G" letter or the little black arrow on the left side of the
search box, click "View History...", click "Clear History" link (if
you don't see the "Clear History" link, make sure you have made
searches while you have allowed toolbar to show you search
suggestions, see below text paragraph).
If you don't want Google Toolbar to save searches, click "Settings",
"Options...", "Search Box Settings...", and uncheck "Suggest searches
from my search history".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Can Google Toolbar be used in other browsers than Internet
Explorer?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Yes, there is a version for Mozilla Firefox:
http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/
There is also an unofficial version for Mozilla/Netscape 7 called
Googlebar:
http://googlebar.mozdev.org/
----------------------------------------------------------------------
======================
6. GMAIL (GOOGLE MAIL)
======================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
After I have logged in to Gmail, why doesn't Gmail work?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
There can be many reasons: Gmail may have problems, or you may have
proxy issues, or your internet security software (antivirus, personal
firewall, web filtering program) or an extension for Mozilla Firefox
may prevent you from using Gmail, or your browser isn't supported by
Gmail. Here are some solutions:
- if you are using internet security software (antivirus, personal
firewall, web filtering program), disable them for troubleshooting
purposes
- you may have problems because of proxy issues, so try logging in at
https://gmail.google.com
(or https://mail.google.com/ for Google
Mail users)
- reload web page after you have logged in to Gmail
- empty browser's cache
- allow cookies for Google
- allow JavaScript for Gmail
After these changes, close the browser window, and open another to log
in to Gmail.
If the above tips don't help and if possible, try a different browser
(for example Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Opera) or a
different computer to find out if the problem is with a setting or a
program instead of Gmail.
Fully supported browsers by Gmail (January 2009):
- Internet Explorer 7,
- Mozilla Firefox 2.0+,
- Google Chrome, and
- Safari 3.0
Somewhat supported browsers by Gmail:
- Internet Explorer 5.5+,
- Mozilla Firefox 0.8+,
- Mozilla 1.4+,
- Netscape 7.1+, and
- Safari 1.3+
Only Basic HTML view used for browsers:
- Internet Explorer 4.0+,
- Netscape 4.07+, and
- Opera 6.03+
You might find your answers from the Gmail Help pages:
http://mail.google.com/support/
You can also use a discussion forum about Gmail to ask for assistance:

Q:
What is google.public.support.general?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
The google.public.support.general is an official Google newsgroup that
was created by Google in year 2001 and which is supposed to be
accessed with the Google Groups web interface using a web browser:
http://www.google.com/googlefriends/oct2001.html#talk
The google.public.support.general newsgroup has been replaced by
official Google forums, see the below page for a list of some of the
official and unofficial Google forums:
http://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-forums
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I read google.public.support.general with a newsreader?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
The google.public.support.general newsgroup and other newsgroups in
the google.* hierarchy are special newsgroups in the sense they are
only supposed to be read with the Google Groups web interface using a
web browser. Some newsservers do contain a newsgroup called
google.public.support.general, because the newsserver owners may
create newsgroups with any names they like and some people may think
it is the original and official newsgroup, but that kind of
newsservers probably won't contain the same messages as the original
and official google.public.support.general newsgroup at:
http://groups.google.com/group/google.public.support.general
Even though I mentioned above, that the google.* hierarchy is only
supposed to be read with the Google Groups web interface, you may be
able to post messages to the original and official
google.public.support.general newsgroup (Google Groups version) with
a Usenet newsreader using a trick where you cross-post your message to
another newsgroup. But you probably won't be able to reply with your
newsreader application to messages in the official newsgroup, if they
have not been cross-posted to some other newsgroup so that you can see
that message from a newsserver.

Q:
Where can I find Google logos?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Why is my phone number listed in Google search results?
A:
From JB (jtb5358@yahoo.com):
If your phone number is published in the phone company's directory, it
is public information. As for your address, even if it weren't in the
phone book, there are surely other public records that contain it
From Craig Payne (cbpayne@gmail.com):
Google is one of numerous websites that has been doing this for a long
time (are you also complaining to them as well).
It has been possible to do this on CD's of phone books for >10years -
have you also been been complaining to them for this long as well?
If you are that concerned, Google allows you to remove your number
here:
http://www.google.com/help/pbremoval.html
But this will not get your number removed from the telephone company
CD,s and all the other websites that do this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Where does the word google come from?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Google comes from the word googol, which is 1 followed by 100 zeros:
http://www.google.com/corporate/index.html

Q:
How can I insert the Google Search to my web page?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I add feeds to Google?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You can add feeds to Google's services iGoogle (previously known as
Google Personalized Homepage) and Google Reader by submitting the URL
of the web page or by searching for keywords in the title of the page
or you can try to find links for the feeds from the web page and try
to submit one of them to Google's services. More info:
http://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/feeds
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
Does Google offer a webhosting service?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
Not in the widest sense (you can't use all the gimmicks available in
commercial web hotel services). In the past you were able to make your
own web pages and host various kind of files in Google Page Creator,
which should have been shut down in year 2008. And now you can use
Google Sites, which doesn't have the same functions such as the
ability to host HTML files having your own JavaScript code and CSS:
http://sites.google.com/
(http://pages.google.com/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:
How can I find people (e.g. email, address, or phone number)?
A:
From Tomi Häsä (tomi.hasa@gmail.com):
You can type the name of the person in Google Web search. Try for
example searches [first name, last name] and [last name, first name].
You might also like to add the city and country where that person
might live. You could also try to use a national Google site if there
is one for that person's country:
