Privacy Policy
Wondermill Webworks Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our
information gathering and dissemination practices for all Webmasters.org sites
run by note.com LLC, including this website: Response-o-matic.com
Policies for Webmasters (Website Owners) Using
our services:Our sites' registration forms requires
Webmasters  to give us contact information (like their name and email
address) and demographic information (like their zipcode, country or language).
We use contact information from the registration form to send the Webmaster
"Service Mailings", from us only, which include legal notices, new features and
valuable tips, as well as promotions about our company and our partners. The
Webmaster's contact information is also used to contact them when necessary.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.
As noted above, our Service Mailings include periodic notices to our member
Webmasters regarding new features, legal notices, and valuable tips. Because the
Service Mailings are the only method of sending legal notices to member
Webmasters, a Webmaster cannot
unsubscribe from Service Mailings without
terminating his/her use of our service.
Policies for both Webmasters and Web
Visitors
Links to other sites: The advertisements on our
site may contain links to other sites. Response-o-matic.com is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Before submitting
data to an advertiser site, it is the Web Visitor's responsibility to ascertain
the advertiser's Privacy Policy and not submit the data if (s)he does not find
it acceptable.
Cookies: Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the
same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests
and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site. We also use cookies to track users for the purposes of paying member
sites registered with our Affiliate Program. Cookies are set from both this
website as well as from the master domain, Webmasters.org.
Contests: We may run contests on our site in which we ask contest
entrants for contact information (like their email address) and demographic
information (like their zipcode, country or language). We use contact data from
our contests to send entrants information and promotions, through mailings
conducted by us only, about our company and our partners. The entrant's contact
information is also used to contact the entrant when necessary. We may also use
this data to tailor the entrant's experience at our sites, showing them content
that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according
to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an
aggregate basis. Contest entrants may opt-out of receiving future mailings
related to that contest; see the choice/opt-out section below.
We also have contractual arrangements with affiliate marketing networks,
provide some of the advertisements shown on our sites.
To find out more about
how these networks handle the collection of personal information, please visit
their provacy statements at:
IP Addresses: We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with
our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help
identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
SecurityWe take the security of
our data seriously and utilize several software and hardware devices to protect
unauthorized access to our data. In addition, we monitor the use of our service
to detect attempts at accessing our data. Any such attempts may be dealt with on
a technical or legal level, as appropriate in a given case.
Supplementation of
InformationThis site supplements the information that you provide
with information that is received from third parties. For example, we may
contract with a firm which identifies geographic locale of an IP address in
order to better present the site (including our advertiser messages) in the
appropriate language local to a Webmaster or Web Visitor.
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of
this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact
