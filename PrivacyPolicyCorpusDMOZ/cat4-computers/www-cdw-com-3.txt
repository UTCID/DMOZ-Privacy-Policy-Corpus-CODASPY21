What Are Cookies and How Are They Used
Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or device, our online services or our emails that allow us or our third-party providers to collect certain information about your interactions with our emails, our online services and other websites you may visit.  We and our third-party providers may use other, related technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies to collect additional information about your online activity.
We use the information collected through these technologies to:
Remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or next visit to our online services;
Provide and monitor the effectiveness of our online services;
Provide you with advertisements and marketing materials more relevant to you and your interests, including through the use of advertising tracking technologies.
Monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage patterns on our online services;
Diagnose or fix technology problems;
Plan for and enhance our online services;
Otherwise fulfill or support the use of personal information identified in the Our Use of Personal Information section of our Privacy Notice.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to:
change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it;

set your browser to automatically reject cookies.
Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our online services, as some features and options on our online services may not work properly. Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

Your Choices About Online Ads
We support the self-regulatory principles for online advertising published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information about these principles can be found at www.aboutads.info/. If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ to place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  Opt-out cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt out of interest-based advertisements across all your browsers and devices, you will need to opt out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt out again.
If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on mobile apps, please follow the instructions at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or our online services.  It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies and related technologies to collect information about your activity on and use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s principles.

If we make material changes to this Cookie Notice, we will notify you by email to your registered email address, by prominent posting on our services, or through other appropriate communication channels. All changes shall be effective from the date of publication unless otherwise provided in the notification.
