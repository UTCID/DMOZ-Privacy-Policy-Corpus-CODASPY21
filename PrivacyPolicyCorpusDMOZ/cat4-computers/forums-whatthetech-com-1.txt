About What the Tech
Tom (Coyote) Wilson started this site as TomCoyote.org in 2002. Along with SpywareInfo, it was one of the first places to offer online malware removal training in its Classroom. Cluster headaches forced retirement of Tom in 2007, and the site was renamed "What the Tech". Free malware removal help and training has remained a constant.
