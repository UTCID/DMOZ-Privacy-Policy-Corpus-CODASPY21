Overview
The services that Hostway Canada (the “Company”) provides to you are subject to this Terms of Use (“TOU”). You will hereinafter be referred to as “Customer,” the scope of which definition will include, without limitation, your agents, employers, and employees. This TOU, in addition to any Order Form (as defined below) and any other specific agreement for Company Services (as defined below) between Customer and the Company, represents the complete understanding and agreement between the Company and Customer. Except when expressly agreed to the contrary in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Company, this TOU supersedes any other agreement, whether written, oral, by conduct, or otherwise.
THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO UPDATE THE TOU (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CHANGING OR DISCONTINUING ANY OF THE “COMPANY SERVICES” AS DEFINED BELOW) AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMER. ANY SUCH CHANGE OR DISCONTINUANCE WILL LEGALLY BIND CUSTOMER FROM THE TIME WHEN THE COMPANY PUBLISHES AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE TOU ON THE WEB SITE. IT IS CUSTOMER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND IT IS NOT THE COMPANY’S RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER, TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMER IS UP-TO-DATE ON THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF THE TOU.
The most current version of the TOU can be reviewed by clicking on the “Terms of Use” hypertext link located at the bottom of the Company’s web site (the “Web Site”) pages.
THE SUBMISSION OF CUSTOMER’S “ORDER FORM” (WHICH DEFINITION INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE COMPANY’S ONLINE ORDER FORM, HARD COPY WRITTEN ORDER FORM, AGREEMENTS FOR COMPANY SERVICES, OR TELEPHONE ORDERS), OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF ANY COMPANY SERVICES, WILL IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE CUSTOMER’S ACCEPTANCE OF THE TOU AND WILL BIND CUSTOMER TO THE TOU ACCORDINGLY. CUSTOMER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT CUSTOMER HAS READ THIS TOU THOROUGHLY, HAS HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL OR HAS WAIVED SUCH OPPORTUNITY, AND THEREFORE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS TOU.
Wherever in this TOU the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender is used, it will be construed as including all genders, and wherever the singular is used, it will be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, where the context so requires. In each and every instance herein, the term “including” will mean “including, but not limited to.”
The Company will provide Company Services to Customer in exchange for fees and full compliance with the following terms and conditions:
Provision of Services
1. PROVISION OF COMPANY SERVICES
a. Company Services Defined. “Company Services” include the following:
(i) any act of preparing, setting up, connecting, maintaining, terminating, or reconnecting “Customer’s Account” (which definition includes all billing data related to Company Services and the space on the particular Web server that the Company provides to Customer for the purpose of providing Company Services to Customer);
(ii) any use by Customer, or any access provided to Customer by the Company, of computing, telecommunications, software, information, hardware, and equipment provided by the Company or third parties affiliated with the Company;
(iii) any act, or provision of any service, by the Company to Customer related to web hosting and domain name registrations (including server usage and technical support), regardless of duration and whether paid for or not;
(iv) any provision by the Company to Customer, of any space, Internet connectivity, or electrical power;
(v) any access or use related to the Web Site, including the Web Site itself;
(vi) any other service mentioned in the TOU;
(vii) any other service provided by the Company to Customer, whether used or not;
(viii) any other service related to the Company that is used by Customer, whether offered or provided by the Company to Customer.
b. Amendment of Fees & Charges. The Company may amend the fees and/or charges for any Company Services without prior notice to Customer.
c. Management & Backup of Data. Except as described in the specific terms of any backup services ordered by a customer from the Company, Customer is solely and entirely responsible, and the Company is in no way responsible, for the management and backup of all Customer data, and all updates, upgrades, and patches to any software that Customer uses in connection with Company Services.
d. Maintenance Windows. Customer acknowledges and agrees to the weekly scheduled maintenance windows, which the Company may perform at least every week. Customer understands and agrees that during a scheduled maintenance window, any or all Company Services may be unavailable. Customer further understands and agrees that the Company has the right to conduct an emergency maintenance window at any time, during which any or all Company Services may be unavailable.
e. License to Occupy Only. Customer acknowledges that Customer has no real property interest in any equipment space provided to Customer by the Company, and Customer agrees that any such provision of equipment space grants Customer only a license to occupy the equipment space. Payment by Customer for the equipment space does not create or vest in Customer (or in any other party) any leasehold estate, easement, ownership interest, lien, or other proprietary right or interest of any nature in any part of the Company’s premises or facilities including the equipment space.
f. Domain Name Registrations. Company Services related to the registration of a domain name is limited to the submission of the registration request to the appropriate registrar. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE, AND THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH GUARANTEE, THAT A PARTICULAR APPLICATION FOR A DOMAIN NAME WILL BE ACCEPTED, APPROVED, OR REGISTERED. Customer understands and agrees that each individual domain name constitutes a single submission. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to provide accurate information and to notify the appropriate registrar directly, and NOT the Company, about any change to the original information. For country code top-level domain names, Customer acknowledges that the fees are non-refundable, even if the domain name is rejected (because the fee is for the service of submitting the application). Customer understands and acknowledges that each individual registry or registrar may have additional domain registration fees that Customer will have to pay.
g. Third Party Services or Products. Customer acknowledges and agrees that any recommendation made by the Company’s employees for services or products ancillary to Company Services are the recommendations of that employee only and not of the Company. The Company does not warrant the integrity or quality of the services or products provided by such third parties. Customer agrees to hold the Company, any third party entity related to the Company (including third party vendors), and the Company’s executives, directors, officers, attorneys, managers, employees, consultants, contractors, agents, parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates (herein and hereinafter meaning any company owned by the same parent company, whether partially or wholly) harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, judgments, damages, claims, or causes of action, including any and all legal fees and expenses arising out of or related to Customer’s reliance on any recommendation made by an employee of the Company regarding services or products ancillary to Company Services.
h. The Company’s Right of Refusal & Termination. The Company may, at its sole discretion, refuse Company Services to any Customer (whether potential, new, or existing) and/or terminate the supply of Company Services to Customer immediately, with or without any prior notice, if the Company deems Customer to be in breach of the TOU, notwithstanding that Customer may be in breach of any other agreement by complying with the TOU.
i. Email Accounts
All email accounts (including, but not limited to POP email accounts) that have not been logged into for a period of 4 consecutive months or more shall be deemed abandoned and the Company shall have the right to delete the email account (“Abandoned Mailbox”) and/or all emails residing in such Abandoned Mailbox (“Abandoned Emails”).
At least 2 weeks in advance, the Company shall send to the master email account a notice that the Abandoned Mailbox and/or the Abandoned Emails shall be deleted if the user or customer does not log into the Abandoned Mailbox within 2 weeks.

Customer understands and agrees that if Customer does not comply with or does not satisfy (in the Company’s sole discretion) the Company’s security and identification verification procedures, then the Company reserves the right to refuse any or all of Customer’s inquiries and/or requests as they relate to Company Services and/or Customer’s Account.
c. Ownership of Customer’s Account & Customer’s Web Site.

e. Customer’s Warranty, Liability, & Indemnification. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Company will be the sole determinant of whether or not Customer is in breach of the TOU. Customer is solely responsible for any legal liability arising out of, or relating to, Customer’s use of Company Services. Customer represents, warrants, and covenants to the Company that Customer holds the necessary rights to use, or permit to use, any item used through any of the Company Services, and that the use, reproduction, distribution, transmission, or display of any data to the public, and any material to which the public can link or access, or any aspect of Company Services made available to the public through Customer, does NOT and will NOT:

Customer must not commit or permit any reverse engineering, reverse assembling, disassembling, reverse compiling, or decompiling, or any attempt to derive source code from, any prototypes, hardware, software, or other tangible objects provided to Customer by the Company.
h. Mandatory Upgrades. If the Company, in its sole discretion, deems Customer or Customer’s Account to be adversely affecting the Company’s server performance or network integrity, or Customer’s Account is consuming use of bandwidth or disk space above the allowance specified in Customer’s particular service package, then the Company may request of Customer, and Customer must comply with such request, to upgrade Customer’s Account to a service package that would, in the Company’s sole discretion, adequately accommodate the use, consumption, and other requirements of Customer’s Account and accommodate the Company’s provision of Company Services to Customer’s Account. Any and all downgrades of service packages are subject to the Company’s sole approval and applicable fees.

Abuse and Breach
3. CUSTOMER’S ABUSE AND BREACH
a. Customer’s Abuse Defined. Any abuse of Company Services is a breach of the TOU (‘Customer’s Abuse’). Determination of what constitutes Customer’s Abuse will be at the sole discretion of the Company. Customer’s Abuse includes Customer’s use of Company Services to engage in criminal activities (including child pornography and fraud), infringement of third party intellectual property rights, display or communication of vulgar, offensive, defamatory, or threatening materials, use of Company Services that disrupts the normal use of Company Services for other customers of the Company or Customer’s customers, spawning processes, consuming excessive amounts of memory, CPU and/or bandwidth, spamming or mass emailing (whether or not it overloads a server or disrupts service to the Company’s customers), unauthorized access to or use of data, systems, or networks (including any attempt to prove, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network, or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network), and interference with the Company’s provisions of Company Services to any user (including mail bombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system, and broadcast attacks). Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, the Company specifically forbids the storage of illegal or pirated software, the use of any type of IRC bot and/or proxy (including ‘bnc’ and ‘eggdrop’), the storage or use of any type of software intended for hacking or cracking purposes, the storage or sale of unsolicited bulk email lists intended for spamming or resale purposes, and the forging of any TCP-IP packet header or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting. Customer understands, acknowledges, and agrees that Customer’s Abuse is just cause for the Company to immediately terminate this TOU and any and all provision of Company Services to Customer.
b. Spamming. Customer understands and acknowledges that the Company has a zero-tolerance policy against the sending of unsolicited bulk emails and/or commercial messages over the Internet (“Spam” or “Spamming”), which definition also includes maintaining an open SMTP policy, engaging in Spamming using the services of another Internet service provider (“ISP”) or Internet presence provider (“IPP”) and referencing in the Spam a web site hosted on the Company’s server, and selling or distributing software on a web site that facilitates Spamming and resides on a server of the Company. Hostway requires that all customer’s emails and mailing lists (if any) are in full compliance with the Can-Spam Act as outlined here: http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business and with Canada’s Anti-Spam Law as outlined here: http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2010-c-23/latest/sc-2010-c-23.html. Hostway also prohibits the use of third party/purchased mailing lists. Spamming is strictly prohibited under the TOU and is just cause for the Company to terminate this TOU and any and all provision of Company Services to Customer. The first violation of this policy will result in a written warning. A second violation will result in immediate suspension of Company Services to Customer. Subsequent violations may result in Customer’s account being closed and a minimum fine of $200 accessed. Company reserves the right to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, what constitutes a violation of this provision.
c. Disciplinary Measures. In the event of Customer’s Abuse, the Company may implement, at the Company’s sole discretion, any disciplinary measure, including warning, suspension, or termination of Customer’s Account and all provision of Company Services to Customer. If Customer has been suspended, and the Company chooses to repeal the suspension, the Company may, at its sole discretion, charge Customer a reconnection charge before the Company provides any further Company Services to Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that if a Customer’s Account has been suspended or placed on hold, the Company may redirect visitors of the particular Customer’s web site to the Company’s technical support web page. Customer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any third party entity related to the Company (including third party vendors), and the Company’s executives, directors, officers, attorneys, managers, employees, consultants, contractors, agents, parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, judgments, damages, claims, or causes of action, including any and all legal fees and expenses arising out of or relating to the Company placing Customer’s Account on hold.
d. Monitoring. The Company reserves the right, and Customer consents, to the Company monitoring Company Services and the content on Customer’s web site(s) to determine whether or not Customer is using Company Services in compliance with the TOU. However, Customer understands and acknowledges that the Company does not monitor Customer’s communications, activities, or web site content as a general practice, and the Company expressly disclaims that it maintains any such general practice.
e. Misclassification. Customer acknowledges that Customer’s activity may be misclassified as Customer’s Abuse. A Customer who believes that Customer’s activity has been misclassified may appeal to the Company’s Technical Support Manager. Determination of whether or not Customer’s activity is indeed Customer’s Abuse is at the Company’s sole discretion. Customer further agrees to hold harmless the Company, any third party entity related to the Company (including third party vendors), and the Company’s executives, directors, officers, attorneys, managers, employees, consultants, contractors, agents, parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, judgments, damages, claims, or causes of action, including any and all legal fees and expenses arising out of or relating to the Company misclassifying Customer’s activities as Customer’s Abuse.
f. Breach of the TOU. Customer agrees to report to the Company any breach of the TOU by Customer, any other customer of the Company, or anyone else using Company Services or associated with the Company. If Customer is unsure of whether or not a particular activity constitutes a violation of the TOU, Customer must notify the Company and the Company may make such determination. The final determination of what constitutes breach of the TOU will be at the Company’s sole discretion.
g. Civil &/or Criminal Liability for Breach. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY BREACH OF THE TOU BY CUSTOMER MAY RESULT IN CIVIL ACTION AND/OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
Termination
4. TERMINATION
a. Cause for Termination. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES, AND AGREES THAT IF THE COMPANY DEEMS CUSTOMER TO BE INVOLVED, IN ANY WAY, IN ANY BREACH OF THE TOU THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTICE TO CUSTOMER, THE TOU AND COMPANY SERVICES TO CUSTOMER. THE COMPANY WILL NOT IN ANY WAY BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER, AND CUSTOMER WILL MAKE NO CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY, FOR TERMINATING THE TOU OR COMPANY SERVICES TO CUSTOMER AS PROVIDED HEREIN.
b. Bankruptcy & Insolvency. In the event Customer becomes insolvent or any bankruptcy petition is filed by Customer or any third party against Customer, this TOU will automatically terminate and the Company may immediately terminate Company Services to Customer without prior notice and/or any penalty whatsoever. Customer further consents to the grant of relief from any automatic stay of proceedings against the Company in such event.
c. Effect of Termination. Upon termination for any reason of Customer’s account, the Company will immediately cease provision of all Company Services. The Company reserves the right to delete any data that is left remaining on the Company’s servers for more than thirty (30) days after termination.
d. Survival. The following sections of this TOU will survive the expiry or termination of this TOU for any reason: 3(d); 3(f); 4 to 8 inclusive; 10; 11; 15 to 20 inclusive.

Payment
8. PAYMENT
a. Billing Cycle. The billing or invoicing of Customer’s Account may vary depending on various factors, including the date on which Customer becomes a customer of the Company and the particular Company Services that the Company is providing Customer. The Company’s provision of Company Services to Customer for one (1) month will constitute one “Billing Cycle” which will begin on the first day, and end on the last day, of each calendar month. The Billing Cycle will continue to renew each month until the Company receives a “Cancellation Request” from Customer in accordance with this TOU. The first Billing Cycle for Customer’s Account will commence on the day that the Company receives Customer’s Order Form. If the Company receives the Order Form on or after the first day of a calendar month, then the Company may pro-rate the charges and fees for that month accordingly. The Company reserves the right to modify the Billing Cycle, at any time and without prior notice, so that Customer may be billed or invoiced for Company Services more or less frequently. Any period during which Customer’s account is suspended or on hold will be included in the Billing Cycle.
b. Payment Due. Customer must ensure that the Company receives full payment for Company Services before the beginning of each Billing Cycle, including the initial Billing Cycle. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the Company receives payment before the applicable due date. Customer has 30 business days from the date of an invoice or charge to dispute that invoice or charge; after that time Customer will be deemed to have waived any objections to that invoice or charge. The Company may, at its sole discretion, decide not to provide Customer with Company Services until the Company receives full payment in advance.
c. Methods of Payment. Methods of payment accepted by the Company are cheque, money order, or credit card. If Customer is paying by check or money order, the payment must be sent to the Company’s address as it appears on the Web Site on or before the beginning of each Billing Cycle. If Customer is paying by credit card, Customer authorizes the Company to automatically charge the credit card on file for all recurring fees applicable to Customer’s Account until such time that the Customer Account is closed in accordance with Customer’s Cancellation Request (defined below).
The Company will charge Customer a twenty-five U.S. dollar (US$25.00) service charge for each check that is not honored or for each credit card payment that is charged back.
d. Overages. The Company may charge Customer for any “Overages,” which includes excessive bandwidth and disk space use (which is any use of bandwidth or disk space above the allowance specified in Customer’s particular service package). Customer is solely responsible for preventing any and all Overages on a daily basis. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Company has no obligation to warn Customer about any pending or actual Overage.
e. Delinquent Customer’s Account. Customer’s Account will be deemed “Delinquent” if the Company does not receive payment for Company Services within five (5) days after the commencement of a Billing Cycle.
f. Penalties for Delinquent Customer’s Account. A Customer’s Account that is Delinquent may be put on hold and Customer may be prevented from using Customer’s Account. Delinquent Customer’s Account may have visitors redirected from Customer’s web site to the Company’s technical support web page. A Delinquent Customer’s Account that is unpaid for an entire Billing Cycle may, at the Company’s sole discretion, have any or all files archived, purged, or otherwise deleted. Customer’s Account will continue to accrue charges (including interest charges) while Customer’s Account is on hold.
g. Reconnection Charge. The Company may charge Customer, and Customer must pay, a reconnection service charge of fifty U.S. dollars (US$50.00) to remove the hold on Customer’s Account and to remove Customer’s Account from Delinquent status.
h. Amendments. The Company may amend the fees and/or charges for any of the Company Services without prior notice to Customer.
i. Applicable Taxes. The Company will charge Customer, and Customer must pay to the Company, all applicable taxes, including any retroactive tax on past fees or charges (whether already paid or not) in cases where the Company is under a legal obligation to collect such tax from Customer. Customer is solely responsible for any and all other taxes, which Customer is under a legal obligation to pay.
Cancellation Requests
9. CANCELLATION REQUESTS
a. Automatic Renewal. The TOU will bind Customer, and Customer will be deemed to have accepted the TOU, upon the Company’s receipt of Customer’s Order Form. The TOU, and the particular service agreement(s) executed between Customer and the Company (if any), will automatically renew upon expiration of the relevant Billing Cycle until Customer makes a proper “Cancellation Request.”
b. Cancellation Request Defined. “Cancellation Request” means Customer’s request, in accordance with this TOU, to the Company to cease the provision of Company Services for the particular Customer’s Account. For a valid Cancellation Request that the Company will deem effective, Customer must make any and all Cancellation Requests according to the following specifications:
c. Submitting a Cancellation Request. A Cancellation Request must be given in writing via facsimile, first class postal service (postage prepaid), or by prepaid overnight commercial courier delivered to the Company’s Customer Service Department (address available on the Web Site).

The Cancellation Request must be received by the Company before 5:00 p.m. CST at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of Customer’s then-current Billing Cycle (be it monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually). If the Cancellation Request is received after this deadline, the Company will automatically renew Customer’s Account for the next Billing Cycle. CHARGES ARE NOT PRO-RATED WHEN CUSTOMER TERMINATES CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT WITH THE COMPANY.
d. Full Payment Requirement. Customer’s Account must be PAID IN FULL before any Cancellation Request will be considered effective.
e. 30-Day Money Back Guarantee. The Company will provide Customer a thirty (30) day money back guarantee. If Customer is not satisfied with Company Services within the first thirty (30) days of receiving Company Services, Customer may request a refund of the fees Customer has paid in advance. The thirty (30) day period will commence on the earlier of the day the Company receives from Customer an Order Form. Any and all setup fees, Overages, other charges, and domain name registration fees are NOT refundable.
f. Refund Policy. Refunds are only available in accordance with the 30 Day Money Back Guarantee (above) and will be provided via the same payment method as the original payment.
