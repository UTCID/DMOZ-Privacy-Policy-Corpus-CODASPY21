Price Schedule and Payouts

Use. Our price schedule and payout schedule are outlined on the Advertiser and Partner
pages of our website. All prices and payouts are subject to change at LinkWorth™'s sole
discretion and can happen at any time. If there are any changes, all LinkWorth™ customers
will be notified of these changes.
All fees for links must be paid in full prior to the link being posted on a Partner
web site. Partners will be paid their portion of the price they set or the prorated
portion of a particular month on the next payout date. Partner payout shall not include
any portion of add-on fees imposed by LinkWorth™. Payments to partners are made on the
10th day of each month or the first business day thereafter if the 10th falls on a
national holiday or weekend. Payouts will expire six (6) months from the date of issue if
not accepted or cashed. Check reissues will be honored one (1) time within the six (6)
month period. Additional check reissues will be done at a $30 per check.
Any payments made to LinkWorth™ are held as final sales including the initial payment
made by Advertisers. If a payment is made and a refund is requested, the decision as to
whether a refund will be issued will be decided by LinkWorth™ at its sole discretion on a
case-by-case basis.
Any dispute a customer brings against LinkWorth™ will be subject to an investigation,
and all evidence stored by LinkWorth™ for that customer will be supplied to the

disputes any charges from LinkWorth™, such customer's account will be closed and all
monies paid to LinkWorth™ up until the date of dispute will be forfeited. The user will
not be allowed to use LinkWorth™ Services any longer.
All payments will be prorated for the current month and then be automatically renewed
each month on the beginning of the month. An Advertiser is solely responsible for
cancellation and/or termination of its LinkWorth™ advertisements. Cancellations will be
effective at the end of the day notice is received by LinkWorth™, and an Advertiser will
be charged by LinkWorth™ for all advertisements through the date of the Advertiser's
cancellation through the LinkWorth™ system. All money paid by an Advertiser will be held

the Advertiser's links remain on the Partner(s)' websites. Once the term is fulfilled,
payment will be made to the appropriate Partner or Partners.

Advertiser Listings – Content and Obligations
All Advertisers must follow these guidelines or risk having their account suspended or
deleted. LinkWorth™ will make all reasonable attempts to resolve any matters that arise.
Advertisements submitted that do not follow these guidelines will be declined with an
explanation on how to correct the problem. Advertisers must adhere to these policies and
guidelines at all times:
All advertisements must direct users to a fully functional website. The website you
are promoting must be complete and not contain illegal or hateful material.
Advertisements shall comply to the requirements of the product selected. Each
advertisement will become active only after it is approved by LinkWorth™.
Advertisers must provide accurate account information, up to date billing information
and a valid email. If any of this information is incorrect, it can lead to loss of
advertisement deals, suspension of account or even termination.
Advertisers must place their advertisements under the proper category provided by
LinkWorth™, which is related to such ads.
Advertisers hereby agree that they will not contact LinkWorth™'s Partners directly or
otherwise go around LinkWorth™ in order to buy ads directly from Partners found in
LinkWorth™'s system. This will result in immediate termination and loss of any funds in
the account.
Advertiser agrees that all of its communications regarding Partners will be done
through the LinkWorth™ system. Sending and receiving messages shall be performed within
the Advertiser account.
All deals created run from the 1st day of the month to the last day of the month.
Deals created in the middle of the month will be prorated for that month, then renewed on
the 1st of the next month for the full price.
Any deals purchased with a discounted option will run for the term selected and must be paid in advance.
At the end of the discounted term, Advertisers will have the option to renew for another identical discounted term.
If not renewed for another discounted term, all deals will renew automatically on a month to month term.
All deals cancelled by an Advertiser will be removed from renewing the following
month. The deal will still be paid for the remainder of the current term and the Partner
agrees to keep the ad published until the end of the month. All requests from Advertiser
for a partial or full refund shall be determined by LinkWorth™ in its sole discretion.
Advertiser must contact LinkWorth™ in writing within 30 with an explanation regarding the
refund requested.
Advertisers that convert their account to an Advertiser/Partner combo account will
agree to abide by both Advertiser and Partner guidelines.
Advertisers agree to not use or publish information found in LinkWorth™ on any other
medium without the written consent of LinkWorth™. Violations of this will be subject to
copyright infringement and violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
LinkWorth™ reserves the right to amend these guidelines at anytime it deems
necessary. Advertisers must understand these rules so to not risk account suspension or
termination and loss of funds.
All Advertisers subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (“FTC”) jurisdiction agree
to comply with the FTC's Revised Endorsement Guides found at the link below.

Partner Listings – Content and Obligations
All Partners must follow these guidelines or risk having their account suspended or
deleted which could result in loss of commissions earned from the LinkWorth™ system.
LinkWorth™ will make reasonable attempts to resolve any matters that arise, and the
cancellation or suspension of an account will generally be enforced as a last resort.
Websites submitted that do not follow these guidelines will be declined but may request
an explanation from LinkWorth™ regarding correcting their deficiencies. Partners must
adhere to these policies and guidelines at all times:
Partner websites must be complete with working pages and links between pages.
Partner listings can include an infinite number of website listings which will be a
fully functional website with no unfinished areas.
Website listings cannot contain harmful, hateful or illegal material and will only
become active after they are approved by LinkWorth™
Pricing MUST BE COMPETITIVE. Overpricing your listing will result in a declined
approval status with a reason why included in the email.
Partner accounts MUST HAVE A VALID EMAIL. Invalid emails will result in account
termination and loss of all funds. Emails must be allowed from LinkWorth™ since this is
our form of communication alerting of Advertiser requests and system notices. Consider
adding linkworth.com to a white list or safe list in your email software.
All Partner account information must be correct and accurate. Failure to provide
accurate information can lead to delayed payments and possible termination of the
account.
Partner websites must be full of content related to the category or theme in which it
is submitted.
Partner websites must be search engine friendly.
Submissions must be a unique domain that is owned by the Webmaster and easily
maintained. Listings that reside on free web servers that result in long and confusing
subdirectory URLs will be declined.
When a Partner publishes LinkWorth™ advertisements, the html code must not include
any linking technique unreadable by search engine spiders. This includes using
noindex/noarchive meta tags, nofollow tags unless option is toggled, redirections,
robots.txt redirections and cloaking methods. All LinkWorth™ advertisements must be
published EXACTLY as our system provides it.
Partner websites cannot consist of a redirection to a different website or page. The
URL submitted to the LinkWorth™ system must be the exact address of the Partner website.
Partner website must not consist of excessive popup windows or advertisements on the
homepage.

website.
Partner website must not require users to pay and/or login to view content.

Website submissions must be complete and accurate. DO NOT CAPITALIZE every letter,
every first letter or any part of the website address. Do not use exclamation or
superlatives in the title or description. Use correct grammar and spelling. Any
violations will result in the rejection of new website listings.
Descriptions should not include statistics about the website, including PR, PageRank,
Alexa rating or anything else related. Descriptions should only include a description of
the website itself.
Partners agree to not accept payment or ads from LinkWorth™ Advertisers unless going
through the LinkWorth™ system. Accepting ads around our system will result in loss of all
funds owed and closing of the account. If an Advertiser attempts to solicit itself, we
request all Partners to notify LinkWorth™ of the instance and any information.
Partners agree to publish advertisements immediately after approving them. Failure to
do so will result in the expiration of the deal.
Partners agree that published advertisements will remain in place until the
Advertiser or Partner decides to cancel the deal. Deals are monitored daily and if the
text link ad is not found, a system warning/notice will be sent via email until it is
found again. If not re-published, the deal will be cancelled and funds returned to the
Advertiser.
If a deal is cancelled by the Advertiser, the Partner agrees to leave the text link
ad cancelled until the end of the month, unless requested by the Advertiser to remove
immediately. If an Advertiser cancels the deal, the Partner will receive the full payment
for that term, so the text link ad should remain until the end of the month.
If a deal is cancelled by you during a term, the payment will be prorated and
remaining term of funds will be returned to the Advertiser.
Partner agrees to either approve or decline all Advertiser requests. Continued
expirations of requests will result in account termination and loss of any funds.
Partner agrees to accept either "Titles Only" or "Titles Descriptions." By default,
Partners are set to accept both. If any Partner chooses to only accept titles, this
setting must be altered in the "Manage Settings" section.
Partner agrees not to contact Advertisers directly and agrees that all communication
between themselves and Advertisers will be conducted through the LinkWorth™ messaging
system.
Partner agrees to publish advertisements in the location the Advertiser selects and
for which it pays.
Partners who participate in the LinkWorth™ affiliate program agree to promote our
service with ethical techniques. SPAM will not be tolerated and any reports of SPAM with
a LinkWorth™ affiliate link will be dealt with accordingly.
Monthly payments are made on the 10th of each month if the amount owed surpasses the minimum
payout set for the account. Read more details on payments in Section 8.
Any advertisement removed by a Partner without proper cancellation or notification to
the Advertiser and/or LinkWorth™, the entire transaction/deal will become null and void.
Partners that convert their account to a combo account will also be subject to all
Advertiser guidelines and policies.
Partners agree to not use or publish information found in LinkWorth™ on any other
medium without the written consent of by LinkWorth™. Violations of this provision will be
subject to copyright infringement and violators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the law.
LinkWorth™ reserves the right to amend these guidelines at anytime necessary.
LinkWorth™ also reserves the right to refuse any website it deems unsuitable for its
system. Partners must understand their rules so to not risk account suspension or
termination and loss of funds.
All Partners subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (“FTC”) jurisdiction agree to
comply with the FTC's Revised Endorsement Guides found at the link below.
