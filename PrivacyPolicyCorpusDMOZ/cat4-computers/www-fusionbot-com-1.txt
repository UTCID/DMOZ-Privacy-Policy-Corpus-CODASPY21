FusionBot® Service Agreement - Terms of Use
Welcome to FusionBot’s Service Agreemen/images/robot.phpt. This Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of the FusionBot service. If you ("Customer") do not accept these terms and conditions or have any questions, please contact LOGIKA Corporation ("LOGIKA"), creators of the FusionBot web site, software, and services.
LOGIKA may amend this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on the FusionBot site. The amended terms shall automatically be effective 10 days after they are initially posted on the site. This agreement was revised on January 6, 2006.
License – LOGIKA grants to Customer a non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license to use 1) the FusionBot service to index a single web site, named during the Registration process, and specifically excludes the indexing of content of any other web site, except those for which are specified in a mini-portal (bronze, silver, gold, platinum) or compiled for our Platinum Subscribers; 2) the software code provided by LOGIKA to create a "search box"; and 3) the FusionBot, LOGIKA or other such logo or phrase that LOGIKA may develop to indicate the source of the search results (collectively, the "Services and Software"). Customer shall not copy, duplicate, modify or incorporate in any other work, or any of the Services or Software. Customer shall not reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce to human perceivable form, any of the Services or Software.
Eligibility for Membership – Services and Software are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Services and Software are not available to minors. In addition, sites that contain illicit, immoral, or unscrupulous messages are not eligible for the FusionBot FREE package.
If you do not qualify, please do not use the Services and Software. LOGIKA may refuse the Services and Software to anyone at any time, at LOGIKA’s sole discretion.
System and Application Changes – LOGIKA reserves the right, as reasonably necessary or convenient for LOGIKA’s own purposes or to improve the quality of the Services and Software to Customer, to change the rules of operation, accessibility periods, Customer identification procedures, types of equipment utilized by LOGIKA, system interfaces, operating and other system and network software, utilities and database software, and to implement enhancements or updates to the Services and Software.
Subscription Fees - The current Subscription Fees are available here, and are incorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. Customer is responsible for paying all applicable taxes and for all hardware, software, service and other costs you incur to access LOGIKA’s servers. LOGIKA may in its sole discretion add, delete or change some or all of the Services and Software at any time.  For paid subscriptions, LOGIKA, at the beginning of each billing cycle, will attempt to charge the applicable fee to your credit card on record for a period of three consecutive days until successful.  If after the third attempt LOGIKA is unable to process your credit card, your subscription will be automatically reduced to the free package and only those features provided with this package will be available to you.  You can adjust your service level by logging in to your account and providing valid credit card information.
Free, Bronze, Silver and Gold Packages will be limited to 100,000 (100K) queries per month without additional per query charges.
TERM - This license is effective until terminated as set forth herein. LOGIKA may terminate this license upon fifteen (15) days notice to You. You may terminate this license at any time by destroying all complete and partial copies of the Product including backup copies. This license will also terminate automatically upon conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or upon failure to comply with any term or condition. Upon any such termination, you must immediately destroy all complete and partial copies of the Product, including all backup copies. All paid packages will be billed a full month's service for any subscription that is provided on a customer's site for not less than half of the terminated month's days.
Refunds for partial months / years service must be directed to the Support Department.
As stated previously, service greater than or equal to half of the current month's days constitutes a full month of service, and no refund will apply.
Terminations occurring before the first half of a month will be credited for the partial month's service pro-rated across the average number of days the service was running.
During the first month of service, LOGIKA will provide an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee.
