We have worked to make the Privacy Policy more coherent and understandable by reorganizing its sections (listed in the Table of Contents below), providing additional important details, and defining a few terms.Please, take the time to read our Privacy Policy carefully. We want to be clear on how we’re using information, and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.When we refer to “Targetprocess”, we mean the Targetprocess entity that acts as the Controller or Processor of your information, as explained in more detail below.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at: gdpr@targetprocess.comApplicability of Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy applies to your Personal Data when you use:Targetprocess website and ServiceTargetprocess mobile applicationsTauboard View sharing Service for Targetprocess.It also applies to other interactions (e.g. customer support inquiries, webinars, user conferences, feedback sharing, etc.) you may have with Targetprocess.The scope of the data processing will differ for the services and websites mentioned above, but this document covers the most comprehensive examples.If you do not agree with the terms, you should not access or use the Services, websites, or any other aspect of Targetprocess business.This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through plugins, mashups or external tools. The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity) that entered into the Service Agreement (“Customer”) controls their instance of the Services (their “Instance”) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Instance settings and privacy practices, please contact the Administrator of the Customer whose Instance you use.  If you have a registered Services user, you can check the  "Users" or "People" view in your Account (https://YOUR-INSTANCE.tpondemand.com/ ) for contact information of your Instance Administrator(s). For Vizydrop Service at https://vizydrop.com/spaces/YOUR_UID  you'll have to contact your administrator or company IT administrator directly. If you have received an invitation to join Instance but have not yet created an user account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.Information we receive and collectTargetprocess may collect and receive Customer Data (including Personal Data) and other information and data:Information you provide to us:Account and Profile Information:  We collect information about you and your company as you register an Instance, create or modify your user account, make purchases, as well as use, access, or interact with the Services and websites (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on, or share Content).

Certain features of Targetprocess Services, such as the Tauboard.com service (owned and operated by Targetprocess), allow your Instance Administrators or users to make some of your Data be only protected by a unique hash in URL, and not requiring explicit authentication (in which case it will become readily accessible to anyone with the URL). We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any data you input into Targetprocess Services and share with the Tauboard.com service.Third Party Services: Customer can choose to connect Third Party Services using Plugins, Mashups or other tools such as Tasktop Integration Hub to their instance. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Instance Users and/or Administrators to enable and disable these integrations for their Instance. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Targetprocess. For example, if a Source Control integration is enabled to permit Source code commits to be linked to Targetprocess Entities in the Instance, we will receive repository access credentials and source code along with additional information that the application has made available to Targetprocess. Administrators and Users should check the settings and additional details for these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Targetprocess.
