Privacy Policy
Zarca Interactive ("Zarca") is an application service provider that provides you, our customer, tools to create and deploy Web surveys, Web forms, Web-based event registration forms, including capabilities to generate reports, upload, input and download data through its unique technology platform for your customers, employees, suppliers and constituents.
Like the postal service, we understand that the Information (defined below) we deliver belongs to you and your survey participants, not us. At Zarca, it is a core business principle that we must protect the privacy of our customers and survey participants or we will not have either. With this principle in mind, Zarca created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.
You should be assured that our practices stated in this policy are practiced worldwide. Zarca is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. We may share information between Zarca entities and transfer it to offices around the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for personal information than the country in which the information was provided. No matter the country standards, we will still handle the information in the manner we describe here.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on our web site at the URL http://www.zarca.com(the "Site") and our Zarca service platform. It does not speak about Zarca practices for Information collected elsewhere or the practices of any third parties, including those of our partners who may display Zarca branding on their sites. The use of Information collected through our service platform shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Customer has engaged Zarca.
If you have questions about this privacy policy please email, privacy@zarca.com.
1. What Information do we collect?
Zarca collects information about both you, our customers ("Customers" or "you") and the individuals who participate in, or are invited to participate in, any of your surveys ("Survey Participants"). Collectively, the information collected about you ("Customer Information") and Survey Participants ("Participant Information") are referred to as "Information".
Customer Information: When Customers register on the Site, we ask you to give us your name and contact information: company name, name of contact, title of contact, company address, telephone number, email address, user name and password, and billing information which may include credit card numbers. Customers also provide us with Information regarding the Services you have ordered (e.g., the number of surveys Customers will pay for or whether you want a private or public survey). In addition to the Information you knowingly provide, we also know when and how often you log on to the Site. (See "Tracking Technologies" below.)
Participant Information: We receive Participant Information from both Customers and Survey Participants. You provide us with the email address, and sometimes the name, of each Participant. Before receiving such Information, we contractually require that you warranty that you have a pre-existing relationship with the Survey Participant and/or the Survey Participant's permission to receive electronic messages. Survey Participants provide us with the Information requested by you; for example, their gender or zip code, as well as all answers to the survey questions. Customers are solely responsible for the content of their surveys; we do not control the theme or questions asked in any survey. In order to enhance survey response rates, we record (i) if and when a Survey Participant has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when a Survey Participant has received a reminder. In addition, we receive any Information contained in any communications a Survey Participant makes directly with Zarca. (See "Tracking Technologies" below.)
We also log Customer and Survey Participant Internet Protocol addresses to ensure the accuracy of the survey data and for system administration purposes including tracking a user's session so that we know when, how often and what pages of the Site a user visits. To prevent the need to re-insert user-name and password as you and your Survey Participants move from one page of the Site to the next, we do use a cookie. (See "Tracking Technologies" below).
You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.
