Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience
on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we
want you to use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools,
and opportunities with complete confidence.
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment
to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how OffspringNet
collects information from all end users of OffspringNet’s Internet
services (the “Services”)—those who access some of our Services
but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those who pay
a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service (“Members”)—what
we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors
and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information.
OffspringNet requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Personal Information OffspringNet
Collects and How It Is Used
Introduction
OffspringNet collects information in different ways from Visitors
and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the
network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this
information primarily to provide a customized experience as you
use our Services and, generally, do not share this information
with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information
collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in
very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such
disclosure is required by law or other special cases described
below.
Registration
Members are asked to provide certain personal information when
they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone
number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and
the type of personal computer being used to access the Services.
The personal information collected from Members during the registration
process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing
purposes). This information is not shared with third parties,
unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
However, in instances where OffspringNet and a partner jointly
promote the Services, OffspringNet may provide the partner certain
personal information, such as the name, address, and username
of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint
promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner
to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal
information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose.
OffspringNet may also generate nonidentifying and aggregate profiles
from personal information Members provide during registration
(such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As
explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and
nonidentifying information to sell advertisements that appear
on the Services.
OffspringNet Partners and Sponsors
Some OffspringNet products and services are offered to Visitors
and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. For
example, we outsource the provision of stock quotes and operation
of your stock portfolio (accessible through your Personal Start
Page) to a third-party vendor. To provide Visitors and Members
some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect
and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will
be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and
may decide not to use that particular service or feature. Additionally,
many OffspringNet Members have cobranded Personal Start Pages
that are cosponsored by nonaffiliated partners. OffspringNet will
share nonidentifying and aggregate information (except as described
above), but not personal information, with such partners in order
to administer the cobranded products or services offered.
Online Shopping
At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register
to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service
updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information,
such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit
card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such
as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may
be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the
recipient’s name, address, and phone number. OffspringNet has
no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information
you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when
doing so.
If you order products directly from OffspringNet, we will use
the personal information you provide only to process that order.
We do not share this information with outside parties except to
the extent necessary to complete that order.
Online Advertisements
OffspringNet displays our online advertisements. We share aggregated
and nonidentifying information about our Visitors and Members
collected through the registration process as well as through
online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally,
in some instances, we use this aggregated and nonidentifying information
to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser
tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between
25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored
to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and nonidentifying
information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement
to the intended audience. OffspringNet does not share personal
information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.
Responses to Email Inquiries
When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to OffspringNet,
the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we
receive. OffspringNet does not use the return email address for
any other purpose and does not share the return email address
with any third party.
Voluntary Customer Surveys
We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer
surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys
because they provide us with important information that helps
us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide
them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain
strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third
party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
We take the information we receive from individuals responding
to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the
responses of other OffspringNet customers to create broader, generic
responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence,
hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
information). We then use the aggregated information to improve
the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services
and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information
may be shared with third parties.
Special Cases
It is OffspringNet’s policy not to use or share the personal information
about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described
above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or
otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, OffspringNet
may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or
information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible
through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion,
we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy
laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations,
or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose
information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal
action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use
Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly;
or to protect OffspringNet and our Members.
"Cookies" and How OffspringNet
Uses Them
A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard
drive when you visit certain Web sites. OffspringNet may use cookies
to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical
purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to
manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member and
have created your own Personal Start Page, we will use
a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and
personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties
to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware
that if you visit non-OffspringNet web sites where you are prompted
to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept
cookies.
Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do
not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility
for information collected through them.
OffspringNet's Commitment to
Children's Privacy
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. It
is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws.
We have Web pages designed especially for our younger users.
While we make every effort to ensure that these Web sites are
fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience, we believe that
there is no substitute for proper parental supervision.
Also, OffspringNet recommends that children ask a parent for
permission before sending personal information to OffspringNet,
or to anyone else online.
Public Forums
Please remember that any information you may disclose in our Member
Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet,
becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding
to disclose personal information in these public areas.
OffspringNet's Commitment to
Data Security
Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place
to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity
and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that
our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from
illegally obtaining this information.
