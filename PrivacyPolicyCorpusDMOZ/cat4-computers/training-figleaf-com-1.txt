Why FigLeaf?
Our personal info is so valuable that everyone wants a piece of it. Advertisers. ISPs. Search engines. Social networks. Online merchants. You name it.
They get to decide what happens to our personal info. What we see. What we consume. Where our info ends up. That’s the way the internet works.
That’s why we built FigLeaf — to give you the choice to be private. With FigLeaf, the internet is yours again.
Your privacy is everything to us. So we prefer to know nothing about you. Here’s what this means:
Only the tiniest bit of info is needed to make FigLeaf work. For everything else, we ask for your permission.
Your data is encrypted on our servers and on your device. To decrypt it, FigLeaf needs your password — and only you know it.
If we ever need some info to help with a transaction, we’ll ask for it first. You’re always in control of what you share with us.
Scan for breaches
Enter your email or add your favorite accounts. FigLeaf gets to work and checks if your personal info has been exposed.
Mask your email
It’s your personal email. There’s no reason it should be public. With FigLeaf, you get a masked email to use when signing up at new sites.
Log in automatically
Create strong and unique passwords for each of your favorite sites. FigLeaf remembers everything and logs you in securely.
Connect privately
You shouldn’t have to think twice about the security of that café Wi-Fi or even your home internet. And you won’t, with Private Connection.
Block trackers
Without tracking protection, advertisers can find out your online habits and interests. Stop them in their tracks with FigLeaf’s Anti-Tracker.

Mask your payments
Shop happy with Masked Cards. FigLeaf has your back with a virtual card that keeps your real number private whenever you buy something online.
