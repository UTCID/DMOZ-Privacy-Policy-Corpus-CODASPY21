If you choose to access the Site from other locations, you do so at your own risk and are solely responsible for compliance with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The display of the Site alone does not subject cosmigo to any specific jurisdiction. You may not use or export any of the Site content or Applications in violation of german export laws and regulations. Any claim related to the use of the Site or to the Site content or Applications shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Germany as applied to agreements made and to be performed entirely therein.

Communications made through the Site’s e-mail and messaging system shall in no way be deemed to constitute legal notice to cosmigo or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives, with respect to any existing or potential claim or cause of action against cosmigo or any of its affiliates, officers, employees, agents or representatives, where notice to cosmigo is required by contract, or any federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations. If, but only if, applicable law requires that we accept e-mail notices, then you may send us e-mail notice at info@cosmigo.com. With respect to our notices to you, we may provide notice of Amendments by posting them on the Site and you agree to check for changes. Instead, or in addition, we may give notice by sending e-mail to the e-mail address you provide during registration or otherwise. Notice shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after it is posted or an e-mail is sent, unless (as to e-mail) the sending party is notified that the e-mail address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address provided during registration. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing.
23. Notice of Copyright Infringement. cosmigo respects the intellectual property rights of others and requests that you do the same. Anyone who believes that his, her or its work has been reproduced on the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement may provide a notice to the designated Copyright Agent for the Site containing the following:
(a) an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit cosmigo to locate the material;
(d) the address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
(e) a representation that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
(f) a representation that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Copyright infringement claims and notices (but not other notices) should be sent to the attention of Legal department, by any of the following means:
by mail: cosmigo GmbH, Luthereichenhöhe 11, 09116 Chemnitz, Germany
by phone: +1(858) 876-4263
by fax: +1(815)366-7912
by e-mail: info@cosmigo.com
If cosmigo receives proper notification of infringement pursuant to the procedure set forth above, it will remove or disable access to the challenged material and will take reasonable steps to notify the party who originally posted it (the “posting party”) that the material has been removed. The posting party may then submit a counter-notification by sending an e-mail message to the Copyright Agent designated above explaining why the posting party believes that material is not infringing. To be effective, the counter notification should include:
(a) a physical or electronic signature of the posting party;
(b) identification of the material that has been removed and the location where the material was located before it was removed;
(c) a statement under penalty of perjury that the posting party has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
(d) the posting party’s contact information, such as the address, telephone number and email address; and
(e) a statement that the posting party will consent to jurisdiction of the federal court for the district in which that address is located and that the posting party will accept service of process from the person who provided the notification described above or that person’s agent.
Upon receipt of a counter-notification complying with these requirements, cosmigo will promptly provide the person who submitted the original notification with a copy of the counter-notification and will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days unless that person provides to the Copyright Agent designated above notification that the person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity related to the material posted to the Site.
24. WE MAKE NO GUARANTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVACY OF ANY COMMUNICATION OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED ON THE SITE OR ANY WEB SITE LINKED TO THE SITE.
