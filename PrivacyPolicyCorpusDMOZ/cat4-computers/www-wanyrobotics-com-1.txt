Proof Of Purchase
Wany Robotics will send you a confirmation of your order via email. In addition, you will receive a confirmation of your order when your order is shipped.
Risk Of Loss
All items purchased from Wany Robotics are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
Product Descriptions
Wany Robotics attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Wany Robotics does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Wany Robotics itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
Custom-Configured Product
Wany Robotics offers certain products that may be custom-configured to your specifications, and Wany Robotics encourages you to review your order carefully. Since a custom-configured product is built to your specifications, the order cannot be changed, modified, or cancelled once your order is in production.
Pricing
Except where noted otherwise, the List Price displayed for products on our website represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The List Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price may represent "open-stock" prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer's estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. Where an item is offered for sale by one of our merchants, the List Price may be provided by the merchant.
With respect to items sold by Wany Robotics, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
Please note that this policy applies only to products sold and shipped by Wany Robotics. Your purchases from third-party sellers using Wany Robotics Payments are charged at the time you place your order, and third-party sellers may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
