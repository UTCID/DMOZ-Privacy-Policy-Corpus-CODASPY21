Cablenet Trading Ltd – Cookies Notification
Introduction
Our website uses Cookies.
Why do we use cookies;
Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site, such as the number of visitors. They also help us to:
Continually improve our website
Improve the speed and security of our website
Remember your search settings during and between visits
What are Cookies;
Are small, often encrypted text files, used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.
The problem with cookies is both one of privacy - what is being registered? - and one of transparency - who is tracking you, for what purpose, where does the data go, and for how long does it stay?
Types of Cookies
Essential and non-essential cookies?
Essential cookies, - Cookies likely to be deemed essential are those used for the shopping basket and checkout, those that provide security for online banking services and those that help ensure that your page loads quickly by distributing the workload.
Non-essential cookies, - are any cookies used for analytical purposes to count the number of visitors to a website, any cookies used by first party or third-party advertisers, including affiliates, and cookies used to recognise the user when they return to a website, so they receive a tailored greeting or optimised landing page.
Session and persistent cookies?
Webpages have no memories. A user going from page to page will be treated by the website as a completely new visitor. Session cookies enable the website you are visiting to keep track of your movement from page to page, so you don't get asked for the same information you've already given to the site.
Persistent cookies - these remain on your hard drive until you erase them, or they expire. How long a cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the cookie to last. Persistent cookies help websites remember your information and settings when you visit them in the future. Other website features made possible by persistent cookies include: language selection, theme selection, menu preferences, internal site bookmarks or favourites, among many others.
First and third-party cookies?
Cookies can be set by the website you have browsed, i.e. the website displayed in the uniform resource locator (URL) window. These are called first party cookies. Third party cookies are set by a website other than the one you are browsing. Advertising networks are the most common begetters of third-party cookies; they use them to track a user across multiple websites, activity which they can then use to tailor their ads.
