Whitepaper:5 Steps To EffectiveData ProtectionPrivacy Amendment Bill 2017(Notifiable Data Breaches)The Australian Government have recently passed a new privacy amendment – the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2017 on the 13th February 2017 – which started a process that meant as of 22nd February 2018, all entities covered by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) will have clear obligations to report eligible data breaches. The big question is what can you do to ensure you are compliant?Read moreThis Bill introduces mandatory data breach notification provisions for agencies, organisations and certain other entities that are regulated by the Australian Privacy Act. As of the 22nd February 2018, when this law came into effect, organisations who hold any kind of private personal data of Australian citizens need to make sure they are doing all they can to protect this information. Just like the GDPR, this is not just applicable for organisations based in Australia, but rather for any organisation globally who holds this kind of data on Australian citizens.The main focus of this amendment is to make sure users are notified when their data has been compromised in a data breach. Organisations will need to make sure that those affected, as well as the information commissioner, are informed within 30 days of a data breach occurring.Failure to do so can result in strict penalties; fines will be up to $360,000 for individuals, and $1.8 million for organisations with an annual turnover more than $3 million. With the law now in effect, it is important for organisations to get things in order – understanding what private personal data needs to be protected, securing it, and putting resources and policies in place. The best place to start is with data classification – the first step to a truly data-centric approach to protecting personal information.Key ChangesIn This Amendment
