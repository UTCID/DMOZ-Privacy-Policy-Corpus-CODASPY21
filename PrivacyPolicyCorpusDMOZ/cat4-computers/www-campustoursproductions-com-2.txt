In other instances, including, but not limited to, interactive maps, virtual tours, walking tours and web pages hosted on CAMPUSTOURS servers or provided to CAMPUSTOURS by third parties, CAMPUSTOURS may set guidelines for what may appear on such web pages and may engage in certain screening, but generally exercises no control over the content of such web pages and is unable to police all such content. Third party content accessible through CAMPUSTOURS from such sources is developed by people over whom CAMPUSTOURS exercises no control. The search results that appear from the catalogs indexed by CAMPUSTOURS's employees are third party sites, and CAMPUSTOURS cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the catalogs from which such search results are gathered. Similarly, web pages hosted by CAMPUSTOURS are posted by third parties, and, with the exception of certain automated screening functions, CAMPUSTOURS cannot and does not screen such web pages before they are made accessible to other users of CAMPUSTOURS. Accordingly, CAMPUSTOURS assumes no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to CAMPUSTOURS web sites or in any web page hosted for a third party within CAMPUSTOURS. In instances where CAMPUSTOURS does review the sites that are displayed in directories, indices, and/or references, or where CAMPUSTOURS makes available directories, indices, and/or references of sites compiled by third parties, the content located at such sites was developed third parties, and review of such sites by CAMPUSTOURS, if any, is narrowly limited to that which is necessary for compiling the particular set of links.
