Daon is committed to ensuring that effective measures are in place to protect the personal data of our customers, employees and other stakeholders, in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
To support our compliance with GDPR, Daon has invested significant resources into the development and operation of our Information Security Management System (ISMS) and Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) which are independently audited and certified against the ISO 27001:2013 standard and ISO 27018:2019 & ISO 27701:2019 extensions to the international standard.
Daon designs all its processes and procedures to meet our stated commitment to maintaining data privacy and the trust of all who rely on our platforms and services. Daon's recently completed SOC 2 examination is a testament to this commitment.
