Trading Standards Warns Consumers About Spanish Lottery Scam – 21/06/2007
Northern Ireland consumers are being warned to be cautious of any mailings that claim they have won the Spanish Lottery. This follows the receipt of a number of complaints by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s Trading Standards Service.
Trading Standards Inspector Simon Keegan explains: “Mailings, purporting to come from the El Gordo Lotteria Primitiva in Madrid, are being sent to Northern Ireland consumers, claiming they have won the Spanish lottery.
“In order to claim the ‘prize’, recipients are asked to provide their bank account details and told that 10% of the winnings will be retained for costs. The ‘winners’ are later contacted and asked for various fees in order to release their supposed prize, but they never receive a penny.”
The El Gordo lottery is the official Spanish lottery but it is only open to Spanish residents. The people behind this scam are not connected to the real El Gordo lottery.
Mr Keegan warned consumers: “Always be suspicious if you are contacted regarding winning a prize when you have not actually entered a lottery or competition.
“No bona fide lottery, such as the El Gordo Spanish National Lottery, would demand up-front fees. Never send any money or give out your personal bank details in response to an unsolicited call or mailing. Anyone wishing to avoid receiving unsolicited personalised mailings should register with the Mailing Preference Service on 0845 703 4599 or log on to www.mpsonline.org.uk. “

Domain Name Facts - know the facts, avoid being scammed
International & UK domains are registered instantly - no other company is informed of the registration and no-one can intervene
International (.com .net .org) domains can be registered for 1 - 10 years, whereas UK (.co.uk .org.uk .ltd.uk .plc.uk .me.uk) domains are registered and renewed at 2 year intervals - it is not possible to register a UK domain for anything more or less than 2 years
Domain names can be registered cheaply, quickly and easily online, you do not necessarily need an agent to register for you
Companies that sell domain names by telesales are almost always scammers
A registration company is not obliged to check trademarks and company names before agreeing to register any domain - this is the registrant's responsibility
Owning a trademark or company name does not automatically entitle you to the matching domain names
It is not possible to "earmark" or reserve a domain name
DON'T send money to companies you've never heard of
