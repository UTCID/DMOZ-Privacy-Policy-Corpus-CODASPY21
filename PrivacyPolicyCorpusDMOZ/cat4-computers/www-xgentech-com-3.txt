Any XGEN Technologies Server that is used for illegal, abusive, or
unethical activity may be immediately deactivated by XGEN Technologies
without warning to you.
Illegal, abusive or unethical activities may include, but are not
limited to, pornography, obscenity, nudity, violations of privacy,
hacking, computer virus, gambling, or promotion of gambling, and any
harassing or harmful materials or uses as determined by XGEN
Technologies.
You agree to indemnify and hold XGEN Technologies harmless from any
claim resulting from your publications or use of illegal, abusive, or
unethical materials.
XGEN Technologies will make reasonable effort to alert you to such
activities when discovered, and allow you an opportunity to fix them
within a 12-hour period after discovery. However, XGEN Technologies is
not required to give such notice before deactivating your use of our
services if, in our discretion, your use is or results in illegal,
abusive, or unethical activities.
If a XGEN Technologies Server is disabled, the regular monthly fees
still apply until the XGEN Technologies Server is terminated by the
Client or Reseller.
To protect ourselves against spam, unsolicited email or activities
which XGEN Technologies considers unethical, XGEN Technologies reserves
the right to ban any IPs, domains or computers whether within or outside
of its network from accessing any computers or equipment of its
network.
You agree not to harass, threaten or abuse authorized representatives
of XGEN Technologies, including but not limited to tech support
representatives, customer relations representatives, and sales
representatives, or otherwise abuse XGEN Technologies’ support services.
