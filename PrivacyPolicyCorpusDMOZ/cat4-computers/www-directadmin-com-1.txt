Refund, Privacy & Delivery Policies
Refund Policy
Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Licenses
Customers may request a refund within 30 days of installation if not satisfied with DirectAdmin Web Control Panel.
To prevent abuse of this offer, only one refund per customer will be permitted.
Licenses ordered after a refund are not covered by this refund policy, but licenses ordered before that time are covered if within the 30 day period.
For example:
Refundable:
Gary orders three DirectAdmin monthly licenses and finds that he likes his old control panel software better. Fifteen days after the purchase he requests a refund on all three licenses.
Not Refundable:
A few days later Gary purchases one more DirectAdmin monthly license for a different server. Once again he finds that DirectAdmin is not for him. He cannot request a refund because he had a previous chance to try DirectAdmin.
Lifetime and Bulk Lifetime Licenses
Due to the permanent nature of lifetime licenses, refunds are not available when lifetime and/or bulk lifetime licenses are purchased. Customers wanting protection of the refund policy should:
Buy a monthly license
If satisfied with DirectAdmin, request a refund within 30 days
Purchase a lifetime license
Privacy Policy
Visitors to our Site
Visitors to our website (all pages within the directadmin.com domain) enjoy complete privacy when browsing our pages.
We do not track visitor activity with cookies nor retain any specific information about visitors.
IP addresses and pages viewed are logged for statistics purposes, but none of this logging activity can reveal information about a specific visitor.
Forum
The forum (located at http://forum.directadmin.com) is the only exception to the above statement. The forum software (vBulletin) uses cookies to track visitor activity. This allows returning visitors to isolate forum posts that have been created or replied to since their last visit.
Visitors registering on the forum are asked to provide information such as their name and e-mail address, along with other optional information (such as date of birth). This information is used only for the purposes of forum activity and is not released to 3rd parties nor used for our own marketing purposes. The only communication received as a result of the forum is when the visitor specifically requests that the forum software notify them of new threads and/or replied-to threads. The visitor's e-mail address and other information is kept completely private and he/she will not received unsolicited communications of any kind.
Requests for Information
Potential customers contacting us via any method (e-mail, support ticket, etc.) are guaranteed full privacy in their respective method of communication. Information is not taken from support tickets, e-mail enquiries, etc. and released to third parties, nor is it used for our own marketing purposes. E-mail enquiries are kept on file, support tickets - database, however, so we can better assist the same potential customer in the future.
Our Customers
Our customers are guaranteed complete privacy in all dealings and communications with us.
Communication
Customers can contact us via several methods, each with varying levels of security. We guarantee privacy across all these methods, but cannot guarantee absolute security. For example, submitting sensitive information (e.g. passwords) via e-mail is less secure than submitting information through an SSL-protected ticket.
All information received from the customer is used exclusively for the purposes of supporting and administrating their account/license(s). Customer information is not shared with any other party, nor is it used for our own marketing purposes. Customers may occasionally receive bulk e-mail from us, but only in situations that relate specifically to their situation (e.g. notification of a serious security risk).
Client Accounts
The client account is used to store information about the customer so he/she can order licenses quickly, without the need to re-enter personal details for each order. Information in the client account is used only for this described purpose, and not for marketing of any kind.
Billing Information
Information received as a result of billing (for example, billing address, phone number, credit card information, etc.) is used solely to process orders and validate licenses. Information collected as a result of billing will not be used for any other purpose, including marketing.
Delivery Policy
Product Delivery
The DirectAdmin software is sold exclusively as an online (Internet) product.
There is no physical delivery (e.g. CD-ROM media via post) nor paper invoices for products.
Software is downloaded as described in our installation guide, located at:
http://www.directadmin.com/installguide.php
Timeline for Ordering
Regular, External Licenses
A regular license ordered from our web page is usually activated and ready to be installed within 24 hours of payment confirmation.
Installations by us are generally performed within this timeframe, assuming that the proper server details have been provided by the customer.
Failed attempts to connect or login to the customer's server will obviously delay the process.
Exceptions to the above statement are possible, especially during peak periods, weekends, holidays, and emergencies.
Bulk and/or Internal Licenses
Internal licenses are generally activated on the same schedule as regular, external licenses.
Installation is usually the responsibility of the customer, although there is a "we-install" option for certain types of internal licenses.
Certain bulk customers (those having high quantities of licenses with us) have the option of instant delivery even without immediate payment.
