What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small snippet of text that a website asks your browser to store. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser. Cookies can be removed in two ways: automatically, when they expire, or when you manually delete them. We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use.

Third party cookies
Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, Storify and other third-party tools may set cookies for sharing content on social networks or for producing access statistics. The presence, number and status of cookies may depend on how you use the platforms concerned before or while visiting Parliament's website.
You should ascertain what the relevant sites' policy is on social networking cookies.
Can I see/view the cookies I have on my computer?
Most browsers have a configuration screen which allows you to see what cookies have been stored on the computer, and, optionally, to delete them. Note that it is not possible for a website to view cookies set by other sites, as this would represent a privacy and security problem.
When are cookies created?
Writing data to a cookie is usually done when a new website is loaded - for example: after a 'submit' button is pressed, the data handling page would be responsible for storing the values in a cookie. If you have opted to disable cookies, then the write operation will fail, and subsequent visits to our website which rely on the cookie will either have to take a default action or prompt you to re-enter the information that would have been stored in the cookie.
How long does a Cookie last?
The time of expiry of a cookie can be set when the cookie is created. By default, the cookie is destroyed when the current browser window is closed, but it can be made to persist for specific period of time after that. For example, cookies we use can last for up to two years.
How secure are the cookies?
Cookies do not in themselves present a threat to privacy since they can only be used to store information that you have volunteered to give or that the web server already has.
What are session and persistent cookies?
Cookies may be either 'persistent' cookies or 'session' cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date unless deleted by you before the expiry date. On the other hand, a session cookie will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.
We use persistent and session cookies to recognize a computer when a user visits our website, track users as they navigate the website, improve the website's usability, to administer the website, to prevent fraud and improve the security of the website.
Besides such functional and session cookies, analytics cookies are set by third-party tools in order to monitor the quality of the user’s experience while visiting our website.
Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ('Google') to help analyse the use of the website. For this purpose, Google Analytics uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer.
The information generated by the cookies about the use of the website - standard internet log information (including your IP address) and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form - is transmitted to and stored by Google including on servers in the United States. We anonymise your IP address before sending it to Google.
In accordance with its Privacy Shield Certification, Google declares that it complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Google may transfer the information collected by Google Analytics to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
According to Google Analytics terms of service, Google will not associate the data subject IP address with any other data held by Google.
You may refuse the use of Google Analytics cookies by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Cookies are also used to record if the data subject have agreed (or not) to the use of cookies on our website, so that you are not asked the question every time you visit the site.
Our website also uses third-party cookies, from services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Intercom, Perfect Audience, Quora, Twitter Reddit, Crazy Egg. For their Cookie Policies, please visit the websites of the aforementioned services.
In what circumstances does Easyhost.com use cookies and why?
We use different kinds of cookies for various reasons outlined below. All cookie information is completely anonymized, meaning we do not see individuals` personal data.
There are also limited third-party cookies on the site. These cookies could be session or persistent and are set by entities other than Easyhost. To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted Easyhost partners. For example, we currently allow:
1. Essential cookies - these cookies are all first party cookies that are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify existing clients and ensure they can access the specific offer pages.
2. Functional cookies - these cookies remember your log-in details if you have the `Stay logged in` box ticked which makes it possible for registered users to return to the site without having to log in. Functional cookies also make sure the website looks consistent as well as allowing us to analyze site usage so we can measure and improve performance.
We use a functional cookie to remember your cookie preference from our 'Cookie preference' tool as well as to provide you with enhanced services like commenting.
In addition, we use functional cookies for Audience measurement and validation. We use services such as Google Analytics to understand how many people visit us and what is popular, which helps us improve the website. Additionally, we use tools like Quantcast and Comscore to validate our understanding of that information for advertising purposes.
When you register or log in to Easyhost.com with credentials from social networks like Facebook, you authorize them to store a persistent cookie that will remember you and grant you access to our site every time you visit until it expires. You can delete that cookie (and revoke the access it grants) by updating your preferences with each respective social network. So if you no longer want to be able to log in through Facebook, you'll need to update your settings at Facebook.
3. Advertising cookies - these cookies allow you to share pages with social networks should you wish to do so. They also enable us and our advertisers to serve you with relevant advertisements that may interest you through a practice often called OBA, or online behavioral advertising. They are sometimes referred to as 'behaviourally targeted advertising cookies' and track information such as which websites you visit and build a profile based on your interests. We however do not collect your personal or sensitive information.
There are also other limited third-party cookies on the site that fall into the `Advertising cookies` category. These cookies could be session or persistent and are set by entities other than Easyhost. To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners of Easyhost. For example, we currently allow:
• Brightcove for our multimedia platform, Doubleclick (Google) for our advertising platform. Those teams set cookies in order to control frequency of advertising and to target advertising to the right section or geographic region.
Do any of the cookies that Easyhost.com use contain my personal data?
No. All the data contained in the cookies that we use is completely anonymous and doesn’t contain any personal data.
Does Easyhost.com use cookies to sell customer information?
No.
How can I change my preferences, delete or opt-out of cookies?
Deactivating cookies or limiting their usage can make certain websites unpractical, more difficult to browse or use. Simultaneously, the refusal to accept cookies does not mean you will not see/won’t be served with online advertising. You have the option to configure your internet browser so that it rejects cookies or so that it only accepts cookies from specific websites. On the downside, you won’t have access to specific functions, such as leaving comments, for example.
All modern browsers allow you the option to configure your cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the „Options” or „Preferences” tab of your browser’s menu.
