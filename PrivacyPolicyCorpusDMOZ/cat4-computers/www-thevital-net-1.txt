What personally identifiable information is collected from you and
how it is used
TheVital.Net will collect personal information during the registration
process. Registration is required in order to make posts in the discussion
forum and to access other member only parts and features of the website.
During the registration process we will ask you for your full name and
surname, and a valid email address. After you have entered this information
we will send you a confirmation email. This is to ensure that noone else
can register your email address without your knowledge.
By registering you agree to receive our periodic newsletter. Every newsletter
contains a link that will allow you to unsubcribe from our newsletter.
Unsubscribing from our newsletter deletes your data from our database,
therefore you will not be able to post classifieds until you reregister.
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
The TheVital.Net may also collect IP addresses for system administration
and verification purposes.

Non disclosure of your personal information
TheVital.Net will never sell, rent or give away your personal
information except under special circumstances, such as when we believe
in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described
below:
TheVital.Net may disclose account information in special cases when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating
the Terms of Service of the TheVital.Net or may be causing injury to or
interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights
or property of the TheVital.Net, other users of the TheVital.Net, or anyone
else that could be harmed by such activities. TheVital.Net may also disclose
or access account information for administrative and other purposes that
we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
Some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal information
being revealed to other users of the TheVital.Net. For example, when you
enter personal information in a discussion forum message, this information
will visible to others. These acitivities are beyond the control of TheVital.Net
and it is your responsibility to act responsible when disclosing personal
information.

The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss,
misuse, or alteration of your information
Other than the administrator of TheVital.Net, authorized personnel
of TheVital.Net and the administrative staff of our hosting
provider, you are the only person who has access to your personal information.
Your user registration and login are password-protected to prevent unauthorized
access.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information,
TheVital.Net cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security
on our systems.

What you should do to protect your online privacy
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
online - for example in ads that you post or through email - that information
can be collected and used by others, for example to send you unsolicited
messages. If you choose to disclose personal information to the public
TheVital.Net cannot be held responsible if a third party collects and
uses this information.
