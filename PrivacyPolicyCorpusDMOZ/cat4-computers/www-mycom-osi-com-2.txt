Marketing CommunicationsIf you have provided consent or where we have a legitimate interest under a contract with you or your employer, we or other selected third parties, such as telemarketing or email marketing agencies acting on our behalf, may contact you from time to time in order to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. Such communications may contain tracking technology that tells us whether you opened the communication and whether you followed the hyperlinks within the communication, in order to help us analyze the effectiveness of, monitor and improve our marketing campaigns. You may also visit our website to find out about our product and services or to contact us. Such website visits may also use tracking technology in order to help us analyze the effectiveness of, monitor and improve our marketing campaigns.
All marketing communications that we send to you will respect any marketing preferences you have expressed to us and any consent obligations required under applicable privacy and anti-spam rules. Where we hold your personal data on the basis of you having given consent, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for certain or all marketing purposes. If you do so, we may need to share your contact information with third parties for the limited purpose of ensuring that you do not receive marketing communications from them on our behalf.

We will normally collect personal data from you where we have consent as set out above, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests (such as responding to an invitation from, or performing a contract with, your employer or where we hold your information under a contractual relationship with you or your employer) and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
With whom we might share your personal data

to MYCOM OSI group companies and other organizations who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality for, or help to enhance the security of our website), or who otherwise process personal data on our behalf such as data hosting or for marketing purposes that are described in this privacy policy or notified to you when we collect your personal data (such as marketing, analytics and research)

Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal data save where we need to do so in order to enforce this privacy policy, an applicable license agreement, our rights generally, or where required or permitted by applicable local or foreign law.
International transfers of data
As a global group we operate, and our website, products, and services are accessed from, all over the world. When you give us personal data, that data may be used, processed, or stored elsewhere in the world, including in countries that have data protection laws that are different to the country in which you reside. Generally, data may be stored or processed by us in the EU or USA. In some circumstances, data may be stored or processed in a location outside these areas where we have a group company office.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this privacy policy. For EU-originating data sent elsewhere, such as our Research and Development centre in India, we use EU model clauses to protect the data.
Data held at our EU sites is covered under and in compliance with EU law in the relevant Member State.

You can usually exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. Alternatively, or to opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us by e-mailing dpo@mycom-osi.com
If we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time by e-mailing dpo@mycom-osi.com.
