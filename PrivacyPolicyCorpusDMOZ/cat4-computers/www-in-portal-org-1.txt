If that is not possible, because the piece carries no copyright or does not identify or suggest a means to contact the copyright owner, we may publish the material or provide a link to the material, on the basis that the Internet is an information source, and we are providing information to a user. Access to our information is free and no profit is derived from that publication. The purpose of the publication is to inform, educate and sometimes to comment upon it.

1.	The physical or electronic signature of either the copyright owner or of a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;

4.	Your name, address, telephone number and your e-mail address;
5.	A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use on the web site of the copyrighted work in the manner you are complaining of is not authorized by the copyright owner, any agent of the copyright owner, or the law; and
6.	A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information you have provided in your notice is accurate and that you are either the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
