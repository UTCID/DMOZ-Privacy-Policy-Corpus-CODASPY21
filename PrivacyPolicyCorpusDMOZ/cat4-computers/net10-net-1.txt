Use of any service supplied to Customer by Net10 constitutes acceptance of this agreement and any additional documents referenced herein.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, and contingent on Customer’s satisfaction of Net10’s credit approval requirements, Net10 agrees to provide the hosting services described in the Order for the fees stated in the Order.
3. Term
Unless otherwise stated in the Order, the initial service term of the Agreement shall begin on the date that Net10 notifies Customer that Customer’s account is activated and ready for use and shall continue for twelve (12) months unless otherwise stated in the Order (“Initial Term”). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew the same length as the Initial Term unless Net10 or Customer provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable. The Initial Term and any Renewal Term may be referred to collectively in this Agreement as the “Term.”
a) Fees Fees are payable in advance on the first day of each billing cycle. Customer’s billing cycle shall be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as indicated on the Order, beginning on the Service Commencement Date. Net10 may require payment for the first billing cycle before beginning service. If the Order provides for credit/debit card billing, Customer authorizes Net10 to bill subsequent fees to the credit/debit card on or after the first day of each successive billing cycle during the Term of this Agreement; otherwise Net10 will invoice Customer via electronic mail to the email address supplied by Customer. Invoiced fees may be issued on or before the 1st day of each billing cycle, and the fees shall be due on the 15th day following invoice date ( invoice due date ), but in no event earlier than the first day of each billing cycle.
Payments must be made in United States dollars. Customer is responsible for providing Net10 with changes to billing information (such as credit card expiration, change in billing address, etc.) At its option, Net10 may accrue charges to be made to a credit/debit card until such charges exceed $10.00. Net10 may charge interest on overdue amounts at the lesser of 2% per month or the maximum non-usurious rate under applicable law. Net10 may suspend the service without notice if payment for the service is overdue. Reinstatement after suspension may incur a fee of $35.00. Fees not disputed within thirty (30) days of due date are conclusively deemed accurate. Customer agrees to pay Net10’s reasonable reinstatement fee following a suspension of service for non-payment, and to pay Net10’s reasonable costs for collection of overdue amounts, including collection agency fees, attorney fees and court costs.
Bandwidth is counted as the combined total of input and output and is measured from midnight on the first day of the month to midnight on the last day of the month, in Mountain Standard Time. Unless otherwise indicated on the Order, overage above your quota is charged at $0.50/Gb and is due and payable on your billing date.
b) Fee Increases Net10 may increase its fees for services effective the first day of a Renewal Term by giving notice to Customer of the new fees at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the Renewal Term, and if Customer does not give a notice of non-renewal as provided in Section 2 above, the Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the new fee for that Renewal Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms (unless the fees are increased in the same manner for a subsequent Renewal Term).
c) Taxes At Net10’s request Customer shall remit to Net10 all sales, VAT or similar tax imposed on the provision of the services (but not in the nature of an income tax on Net10), regardless of whether Net10 fails to collect the tax at the time the related services are provided.
d) Early Termination Customer acknowledges that the amount of the fee for the service is based on Customer’s agreement to pay the fee for the entire Initial Term, or Renewal Term, as applicable. In the event Net10 terminates the Agreement for Customer’s breach of the Agreement in accordance with Section 9 (Termination), or Customer terminates the service other than in accordance with Section 9 (Termination) for Net10’s breach, the unpaid fees for each billing cycle remaining in the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, are due on the business day following termination of the Agreement. Customer also acknowledges that a minimum of 10 days cancellation notice prior to the following renewal term must be given in writing to Net10 or the Customer will be responsible for full payment of the following term.
4. Law/AUP
Customer agrees to use the service in compliance with applicable law and Net10’s Acceptable Use Policy in this Agreement. Customer agrees that Net10 may, in its reasonable commercial judgment consistent with industry standards, amend the AUP from time to time to further detail or describe reasonable restrictions and conditions on Customer’s use of the Services. Amendments to the AUP are effective on the earlier of Net10’s notice to Customer that an amendment has been made, or the first day of any Renewal Term that begins subsequent to the amendment. Customer agrees to cooperate with Net10’s reasonable investigation of any suspected violation of the AUP. In the event of a dispute between Net10 and Customer regarding the interpretation of the AUP, Net10’s commercially reasonable interpretation of the AUP shall govern.
5. Customer Information
Customer represents and warrants to Net10 that the information he, she or it has provided and will provide to Net10 for purposes of establishing and maintaining the service is accurate. If Customer is an individual, Customer represents and warrants to Net10 that he or she is at least 18 years of age.

The terms on Customer’s purchase order or other business forms are not binding on Net10 unless they are expressly incorporated into a formal written agreement signed by both parties. A party’s failure or delay in enforcing any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of that party’s rights with respect to that provision or any other provision of the Agreement. A party’s waiver of any of its right under the Agreement is not a waiver of any of its other rights with respect to a prior, contemporaneous or future occurrence, whether similar in nature or not. The captions in the Agreement are not part of the Agreement, but are for the convenience of the parties. The following provisions will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Fees, indemnity obligations, provisions limiting liability and disclaiming warranties, provisions regarding ownership of intellectual property, these miscellaneous provisions, and other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive termination of the Agreement. There are no third party beneficiaries to the Agreement. Neither insurers nor the customers of resellers are third party beneficiaries to the Agreement. Customer may not transfer the Agreement without Net10’s prior written consent. Net10’s approval for assignment is contingent on the assignee meeting Net10’s credit approval criteria. Net10 Internet Services, LLC may assign the Agreement in whole or in part.
This Agreement together with the Order and AUP constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replace any prior understanding or communication, written or oral.
