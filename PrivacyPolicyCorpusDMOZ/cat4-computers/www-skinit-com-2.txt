8. Disclaimer of Warranties for Products and Services
SKINIT OFFERS A LIMITED 30 DAY RETURN/EXCHANGE POLICY ON ITS PRODUCTS PURCHASED EXCLUDING CUSTOMIZED ORDERS OVER $100.00 WHICH ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE RETURNED FOR A REFUND. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS LIMITED 30 DAY RETURN POLICY, THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE BASIS AND ARE OFFERED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SITE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SITE OR SELLER'S SERVER IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR SERVICES, FROM ANY CHANGES TO THE SITE OR SERVICES, OR FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, EVEN IF SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
10. SKINIT PRICING
With respect to items sold by Skinit, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
11. MISCELLANEOUS
11.1 Seller may assign its rights and responsibilities under these Terms without notice to You. All items purchased through Seller are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to You on our delivery to our carrier (ie, F.O.B. Seller's facility).
11.2 If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision most closely matching the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms will continue in effect.
11.3 These Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and Seller with respect to the Site, Products and Service, and supersede all other communications, written or oral, with regard to that subject matter.
11.4 Skinit may change or modify this agreement at any time by posting an updated user agreement on this site, and Skinit may, but is not required to, send registered users an email notice of those changes. If any change or modification is unacceptable to You, You shall cease using the site. If You do not cease using the site, You agree that Your continued use shall constitute an acceptance of those changes or modifications.
The current version of the Skinit Terms was adopted effective as of June 1, 2014.
