Privacy Policy and Cookies
You’re in safe hands.
I value and protect your personal and business privacy in the same way that mine matters to me.
Rest-assured, the information and insight you provide me with both during and after the course of our business arrangement remains confidential.
The general details below, most of which you are likely familiar with, provide more information in regard to the specific use of cookies on this website. If you’d like to get in touch, you can do so by phone, email or via the Enquiry Form on the Contact page.

Your data
The nature of the service I provide to you, requires you to share sufficient information with me in order for me to fulfil my duties to you. Such information remains confidential.
Cookies
In common with most websites, this one may store small text files (known as cookies) on your browser. These are required for the normal functioning and performance analysis of this site in order for me to provide you with a good browsing experience. You can control and delete these cookies whenever you wish within your browser settings.
Contact forms
Because of the prevalence of internet spam bots, it may be necessary for the contact forms on this website to feature a ‘CAPTCHA’ mechanism in order to block automated form submission by malicious bots. In the past, such anti-spam features were often frustrating for genuine users too, but the latest version of Google’s reCAPTCHA functionality (that this site may use if it becomes necessary) is designed to operate ‘invisibly’ under most circumstances. However, in order to do this, the system requires to assess your interaction with this site to determine that your are indeed “human” and not a “bot”. Links on each contact form will explain this in detail.
Analytics
Again, in common with most websites, this one will be using the services of Google Analytics to inform me of site performance statistics, thereby assisting me in providing the most relevant content for site visitors. To read in detail about Google Analytics cookies, click here >
