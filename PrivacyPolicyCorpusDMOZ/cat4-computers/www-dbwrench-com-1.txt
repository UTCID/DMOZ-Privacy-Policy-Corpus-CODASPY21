Privacy Policy
Orders
If you purchase a product or service from us,
we request certain personally identifiable information
from you on our order form. You must provide
contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address)
and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and
to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order,
we will use this information to contact you.
We use a credit card processing company to process
credit card transactions on our behalf.
Aside from our credit card processing company we DO NOT
share contact or financial information with any other third party.
Information Automatically Collected
Our Web site keeps track of usage data,
such as the source address that a page request is coming from,
your IP address or domain name, the date and time of
the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and
other parameters in the URL. The IP addresses we collect
on our electronic purchase service are linked to personally
identifiable information. This is collected in order to
combat fraud during the purchase process. We also use this
data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate
so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer.
Automatically collected information is also used for the
same purposes as cardholder supplied and merchant supplied information.
Web Analytics Tracking
We use analytics software to track the usage of web pages. The analytics
software may use cookies as a means of tracking session lengths, session paths and
returning visitors.
Legal Disclaimer
We reserve the right to disclose your personally
identifiable information as required by law and when we
believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights
and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order,
or legal process served on our Web site.
