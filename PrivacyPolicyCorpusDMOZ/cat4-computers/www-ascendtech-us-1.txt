Due to the fast pace of the computer and consumer
products industries, all prices are subject to change
without notice. We make every effort to provide you the
most accurate, up-to-the-minute information. Despite our
best efforts, a small number of the items on our web
site may be mis-priced.

price due to typographical, photographic, or technical
error or error in pricing information received from our
suppliers, Ascendtech.us shall have the right to refuse
or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the
incorrect price.
If an item's correct price is lower than our

stated price, we will cancel your order and notify
you of the price error and order cancellation. You
will, of course, have an opportunity to purchase the
item at the correct price, if you so wish.
While we make every attempt to verify prices before
charging your credit card, Ascendtech.us shall have the
right to refuse or cancel any orders placed on
mis-priced product whether or not the order has been
confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit
card has already been charged for the purchase and your
order is canceled, Ascendtech.us shall immediately issue
a credit to your credit card account in the amount of
the incorrect price.

for online and mail-order purchases. Online and

transactional information, or Personally Identifiable
Information, from you such as your name, telephone
number, e-mail address, billing address, shipping
address, credit card or other payment information and a
password. Ascendtech.us does not sell or rent your
transactional information to others. Ascendtech.us uses
customer information only for the purposes of filling
orders, contacting purchasers to inform them of their
order status, sending promotional information, and
enhancing the user experience.
Ascendtech.us will occasionally offer special
contests and promotions. Notification of such contests and promotions are normally sent through the mail or by email. When you enter a contest or
other promotion, we may ask you for additional information
in order to administer the contest, notify winners and make the winners' list

this information is a condition of your participation.

our secure server software (SSL) is the industry
standard and among the best software available today for

of your browser changes color or is no longer broken. To
use this option, you must have a browser that supports
SSL (ex. Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, or Netscape
Navigator).
In addition to our encryption standards, your
Ascendtech.us account information is password protected
so that you and only you have access to this personal
information. Please do not disclose this password to
anyone. Also, remember to close your browser window when
