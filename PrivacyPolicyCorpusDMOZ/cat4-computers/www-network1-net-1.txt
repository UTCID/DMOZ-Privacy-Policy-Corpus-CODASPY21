Introduction
FNGi wants to help you make the most of your visit to our web
sites, and that includes helping to protect your personal privacy.
Most of the features on our web sites are offered without collecting
any Personal Information from you. You can surf FNGi’s web sites and
view much of our content anonymously. For those areas of our web
sites and services that do require us to collect Personal
Information, this Privacy Policy will tell you what you need to know
to make good decisions for yourself.
This Privacy Policy discloses when and how we collect, use,
share, and safeguard information from this web site. The Personal
Information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our
sites or use the various products or services we offer.
By using this web site, you are agreeing to the terms of this
Privacy Policy, as posted in this area of the site. If you do not
agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy,
please do not use our web sites.
As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means
personally identifiable information, such as your name, street
address, telephone number, date of birth and e-mail address. When
Personal Information is collected, you will know because you will
have to fill out a form on the web site. When you make a purchase,
or sign up for a paid service, we will also collect your credit card
information as additional Personal Information. We will use credit
card information only to complete the transactions you have
requested.
Children
FNGi is committed to providing special protection for the privacy
of children who may visit our web sites. FNGi is also committed to
fully complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
(“COPPA”). Our protections for the privacy of children include the
following:
We do not knowingly collect, use or retain any Personal
Information, for any purpose whatsoever (including internal or
external marketing or promotional purposes), from visitors to
this web site who are age 12 or younger. In addition, we will
delete any records of such Personal Information that come to our
attention.
Since we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information
from visitors to this web site who are age 12 or younger, we do
not disclose or transfer any such information to third parties.
We do not request any visitor to provide any information
about their family members, friends or other persons.
We do not allow visitors who are age 12 or younger to be
listed in any directory of registered users, to participate in
any of our chat services, to register for contests, sweepstakes,
promotions, or newsletters, or to receive direct marketing from
FNGi or from our third-party affiliates or service or product
providers.
Note to Parents
If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal
Information at one of our web sites, we invite you to notify us so
that we may delete the information from our records and discontinue
any related features or services (see Opt-Out below). We appreciate
your cooperation in assisting us to provide a safe and enjoyable
online experience for your children.
Collection of Personal Information
FNGi collects Personal Information from visitors to our web sites
in the following ways:
Form submissions with requested and/or required data entered
E-mail transmitted via various links on our web sites.
The use of any of these services is entirely optional and
voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personal Information
requested, we may elect to not make the related services
available for your use. If you send us an e-mail in which you
disclose Personal Information, we will use it to discuss the subject
of your correspondence and, if appropriate, share it with other
interested parties (such as manufacturers of merchandise you have
purchased from a web site).
If you send us an e-mail, you should know that e-mail is not
necessarily secure against interception. So, if your communication
needs to include sensitive information like your bank account,
credit card, or social security number, please contact us by postal
mail or telephone (see Contact Us, below) rather than e-mail.
Cookies
In order to track your use of the site, "cookies" may be
employed. Cookies are pieces of information that are sent by web
sites and stored in your computer's hard drive, which provide you a
service by allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from
having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our web sites.
They also allow us to learn how visitors use our web sites. This
user data is aggregated for tracking purposes primarily by tallying
pages viewed throughout our web sites and logging Internet Protocol
(“IP”) addresses and browser types.
Aggregated usage data enables us to tailor our content to our
visitors’ interests and to help our advertisers better understand
the preferences of our audience. Providing such usage data to
advertisers is essential to keeping as many of our services free to
visitors as is reasonably possible. This information does not reveal
your identity although, in some cases, we may have to combine this
non-identifiable information with Personal Information to enforce
compliance with our Terms of Service or to protect our service, web
sites, visitors or others.
If you do not want to receive cookies, you may set your browser
to reject them. However, if you turn cookies off, you will not have
access to some FNGi features and services.
Visitors From Outside the United States
All Personal Information collected at our web sites is collected
and stored in the United States. By submitting Personal Information
to this web site, you are consenting to the storage of your Personal
Information in the United States.
How We Use Your
Information
We limit the manner in which your Personal Information is used.
We use Personal Information to provide you the products and services
you want, to better understand and serve the needs of the FNGi
community, and to provide news and information to community members
on new content, products and features of the web sites via direct
e-mail. If you have registered with us and do not want to be
contacted in the future by FNGi or our advertising partners, please
see Opt-Out below.
If you order a product or service from us or register for one of
our contests, promotions, or interactive services, FNGi may share
Personal Information with service providers, suppliers and other
third parties (for example, sweepstakes sponsors or delivery
services) that assist us in operating the web sites or providing the
products or services. When we share your Personal Information with
third parties, they may use your Personal Information to send you
information on their additional products or services, but FNGi does
not allow them to sell or transfer your Personal Information to
others. We do not otherwise sell or provide your Personal
Information to third parties.
Finally, please note that we will release your Personal
Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant,
subpoena or court order.
Links to Third
Party Web Sites
Please be advised that this web site contains certain hyperlinks
to other web sites, some of which may display FNGi’s logos or other
FNGi content. These web sites may have privacy policies; however,
all of these web sites and their privacy policies are independent of
our web sites or this Privacy Policy. FNGi is not responsible for
compliance with other web sites’ privacy policies or data collection
practices. You should review these privacy policies carefully before
providing any Personal Information to these web sites.
Limitations on Use of Personal Information
We will only use or retain your Personal Information in
accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and only for so
long as is needed to fulfill your requests, support the services you
have requested, process your orders, or comply with the law.
Security of
Personal Information
We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information
secure, including the use of Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology
to protect credit card information and other Personal Information
you provide in connection with purchases, paid subscriptions or
other similar transactions.
Opt-Out
Any feature on our web sites requiring registration allows you to
opt-out from receiving any newsletters, product offers, or other
correspondence from either us or our business affiliates. In
addition, if after registering, you would no longer like to receive
any such materials or correspondence, please send an e-mail to
info@network1.net indicating
your preference to “unsubscribe,” and we will promptly remove you
from our list. Please be sure to include your name and e-mail
address in the e-mail. You will need to send separate e-mails if you
are registered for more than one of our features or services.
If you believe your child (age 12 or younger) has provided us
with Personal Information and/or is receiving access to certain
features or services, including marketing communications, we invite
you to notify us at
info@network1.net so that we may delete such Personal
Information and/or discontinue your child’s access to the related
features or services.
