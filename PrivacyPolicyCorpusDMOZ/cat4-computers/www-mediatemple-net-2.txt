However, when you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to make your experience better, faster and safer, for advertising purposes and to allow us to continuously improve our sites, services, applications and tools. Any personal information or data collected by these technologies is used only by us or by our authorized service providers on our behalf. What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologiesThese technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other device (“collectively, a “device”) that allows us to record information when you visit or interact with our websites, service, applications, messaging, and other tools. Though often these technologies are generically referred to as “Cookies,” each functions slightly differently, and is better explained below:Cookies: Cookies are small (often encrypted) text files placed in the memory of your web browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. There are several types of cookies:Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time in order to preserve your settings (e.g., while on our site).Third-party cookies are placed in your browser by a website, or domain, that is not the website or domain that you are currently visiting. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.When you enter a website using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing personal information; like your name, email address, and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), which then stores the information for later use. The next time you go to the same website, your browser will send the cookie to the server. The message is sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.Web beacons (pixels): A web beacon (also called “tracking pixels” or “image tags”) is a small file (most often a transparent, 1x1 GIF file) that loaded on our web pages. These pixels may work in concert with cookies to collect information about your visit, your web browser/device, browsing activity, or onsite behavior and provide that information to service providers. Pixels are most commonly used to collect anonymous traffic metrics (page visits, button clicks, order completion) used to analyze site performance.Scripts: A script is a small piece of website code placed on our websites to power customer service tools like live chat, allow for the delivery of video tutorials in our help section, and allow us to provide interactive experiences to visitors. They are also used to collect data that we use for website analytics, or to provide data on the effectiveness of our advertising.Similar technologies: Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers. In some instances, these technologies may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device.
