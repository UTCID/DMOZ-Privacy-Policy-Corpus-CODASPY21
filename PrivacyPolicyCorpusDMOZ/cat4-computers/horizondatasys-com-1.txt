Last Updated: May 21, 2018
We at Horizon DataSys Corporation (“Horizon DataSys”) are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our website or support portal site.
When you visit our web sites, you might be providing information about your visit on two levels:
Statistics collected as you browse our Web sites.
Organizational and personal information you knowingly give us.
Because Horizon DataSys respects your right to privacy, we want you to be aware of how we handle this information.
Our Commitment to Your Privacy
Horizon DataSys assures you that we do not provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers to outside vendors.
Horizon DataSys does:
Safeguard customers’ information from unauthorized access.
Collect, maintain and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet customers’ needs (e.g. customer care or new products or services).
Honor customers’ requests to remove their names from our telephone, mail or e-mail solicitation lists in a timely manner. Just Contact Us.
Maintain confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with our partner or other companies.

Statistics Collected as You Browse Our Web Sites
As you browse our Web sites, Horizon DataSys’ Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:
How many people visit our Web sites.
Which pages people visit on our Web sites.
From which domains our visitors come (e.g., “yahoo.com” or “aol.com”).
Which browsers people use to visit our Web sites.
While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web sites, to monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.
Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us
Within our Web sites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific phone number, product serial numbers and control codes, account number, credit card number, e-mail address, organization URL, or mailing address.
Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks
Your IP Address and Host Name
Horizon DataSys’ Web sites log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.
Registration Forms
We encourage all visitors to register with Horizon DataSys, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from Horizon DataSys, please Contact Us.
Download Forms, Order Forms and Enrollment Forms
Our order forms securely collect visitor’s contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information).Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, Horizon DataSys will share your contact information with other Horizon DataSys partner companies only, not with other outside companies.
You may also be given the option of registering a profile with Horizon DataSys which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.
