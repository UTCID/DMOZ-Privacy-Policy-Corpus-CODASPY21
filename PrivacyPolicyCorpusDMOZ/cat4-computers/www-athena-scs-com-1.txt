(f) Buyer may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Athena and any purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be of no force or effect.

Athena may assign its rights and/or obligations hereunder upon written notice to Buyer. (g) Any waiver by Athena of any default by Buyer shall not be deemed to be a continuing waiver of such default or a waiver of any other default or of any of the terms and conditions hereunder. (h) These terms and conditions may not be superseded, modified, or amended except in a writing stating that it is such a modification and signed by an officer of each party. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. (i) These terms and conditions, which include the documents incorporated by reference on the face hereof (but expressly does not include any of the terms and conditions of Buyer's purchase order, specifications or any similar document issued by Buyer) shall constitute (except for any Non-Disclosure Agreement) the entire agreement between Buyer and Athena with regard to the products or services sold hereunder, and expressly supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, relating to such products or services. (j) The validity, performance and construction of these terms and conditions, and any disputes arising from or relating thereto, shall be governed by the laws of Japan.

The United Nations Convention on the Sale of Goods, Uniform Commercial Code, and Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall not apply to these terms and conditions. IF THE SCOPE OF WORK CONTAINS DESIGN OR DEVELOPMENT, PARAGRAPHS 13-17 ALSO APPLY.
13. ATHENA RESPONSIBILITIES Athena shall use commercially reasonable efforts to design and/or develop the product set forth herein, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the schedule for each milestone of the design and development. Except as agreed to by the parties, Athena shall provide all technology, labor, material, tooling, and facilities necessary for such design and development effort. Buyer shall provide the specifications and other related information for such product.
14. ACCEPTANCE Buyer shall have ten (10) days (except thirty (30) days on delivery of the prototypes) after the notice of completion of each milestone to reject the results of such milestone as not meeting the requirements. If an express written rejection is not received by Athena within such acceptance period, the results of such milestone shall be conclusively deemed to have been accepted. Any rejection shall be in writing and shall specify in detail the reasons for such rejection. In the event of such rejection, Athena shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification of rejection to cure the defects or other nonconformity set forth in such notice, or to provide Buyer with a schedule providing for the resolution of such defects. In the event that Athena is unable to cure such defects or other nonconformity, Buyer shall not be liable for the payment due to Athena for such milestone. Athena shall have no obligation to continue work following any milestone for which Buyer rejects the results until such results are accepted by Buyer. Each specific schedule shall be revised to fully account for the length of any delay caused by the rejection of any milestone of Buyer.
15. CHANGES Buyer may propose changes to the specifications by submitting a detailed proposal to Athena in writing. Athena will then estimate the amount of rework necessary and the additional development time and cost that would be incurred, and shall request Buyer's approval of such additional cost and development time. Upon written receipt of such approval, Athena will proceed with the changes and the schedules will be amended to reflect the new dates and additional payments (if any) resulting from such changes.
16. TERMINATION (a) During performance of the design and/or development, either party may terminate the design at its convenience upon written notice to the other party. If the design is terminated by Athena, Buyer shall not be liable for any payment for work performed by Athena for the milestone during which such termination occurs. If the design is terminated by Buyer, Buyer shall be liable to Athena for full payment for the milestone during which such termination occurs, regardless of the amount of work actually performed by Athena for such milestone. (b) During performance of the design and/or development, either party may terminate the design in the event of material breach by the other party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice (except for non-payment which only requires ten (10) days notice) specifying such breach to the breaching party. If, during such period, the breaching party cures such breach (or, if the cure cannot be effected within such period, the breaching party commences to cure), no such termination shall occur. If terminated by Athena for breach, Buyer shall be liable to Athena for the full payment of the milestone during which such termination occurs, regardless of the amount of work actually performed by Athena for such milestone. If terminated by Buyer for Athena's breach, Buyer shall not be liable for any payment for work performed by Athena for the milestone during which such termination occurs. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 16(B) CONSTITUTE THE SOLE LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PARTY, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF EACH PARTY, IN THE EVENT OF ANY BREACH HEREUNDER DURING THE DESIGN AND/OR DEVELOPMENT.
