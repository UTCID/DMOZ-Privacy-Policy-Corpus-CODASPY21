WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies, as described by the relevant legislation, are small text files which sites visited by the user send to their terminal (usually to the browser), where they are stored to then be sent back to the same sites when they are subsequently visited again by the same user. When browsing a site, the user may also receive cookies on their terminal sent by other web servers or sites (“third-party cookies") which contain some of the elements (e.g. images, maps, audio, specific links to pages of other domains) displayed on the site they are currently visiting. Cookies are used for different purposes: authentication, monitoring of sessions, storing information on specific configurations concerning the users accessing the server etc. Please note that, in implementation of the requirements of 2009/136/EC Directive, there is a requirement to acquire prior informed consent from users before cookies used for purposes other than purely technical ones are stored on their terminal (see art. 1, para. 5 a) of Italian legislative decree of 28 May 2012, no. 69, which modified art. 122 of Italian legislative decree 196/2003 - the “Code”). There are therefore two broad categories of cookies: "technical" cookies and "profiling" cookies:
Technical cookies. Technical cookies are those used only to "perform transmission of communications over an electronic communication network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the supplier of an information service explicitly requested by the subscriber or by the user to supply that service" (art. 122, para. 1 of the Code). They are not used for further purposes and are normally installed directly by the owner or manager of the website. They can be divided into navigation or session cookies, which permit normal navigation or use of the web site (allowing, for example, a purchase to be made or authentication for access to private areas to be performed); analytics cookies, similar to technical cookies when used directly by the site operator to gather aggregate data on the number of users and how they use the site; functionality cookies, which allow users to navigate the site on the basis of a series of selected criteria (for example language, products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service provided to the same. Storage of these cookies does not require prior consent from users, while the obligation to inform them pursuant to article 13 of the Code remains unchanged.
Profiling cookies. The purpose of profiling cookies is to create profiles on the user, and they are used in order to send advertising messages in line with their web browsing preferences. Due to the particularly invasive nature of and the effects that these files can have on the user's privacy, European and Italian legislation requires that users be appropriately informed on the use of these cookies and give their consent for the same. Article 122 of the Code refers to these cookies, requiring that "the storage of information on a contractor or user's terminal, or access to information already stored there, is allowed only on condition that the contractor or user has provided their consent after being informed via the simplified methods per article 13, para. 3" (article 122, para. 1 of the Code).
