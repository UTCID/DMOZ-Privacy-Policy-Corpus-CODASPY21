Disclosure
The California Consumer Privacy Act permits California residents to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
To exercise your right to opt out, please complete the form below to help us determine if our data systems contain any information that relates to you.
Please note that because it is common for multiple individuals to share the same name, we cannot confirm possession of an individual’s personal information on the basis of name alone.
If you chose not to provide the requested information, we may not be able to process your request.
