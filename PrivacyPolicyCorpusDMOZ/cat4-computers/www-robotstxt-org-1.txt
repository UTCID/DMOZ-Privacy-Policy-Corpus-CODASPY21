Privacy Policy
This site does not itself set cookies, or collect personal information
from visitors.
Like almost all web servers we do record the IP address from which
your page requests originate, for performance analysis and reporting,
and for anti-abuse technologies. We will hand those over to
authorities were required by law to do so. We won't share them with
other third parties, and will take reasonable steps from them becoming
public.
Our carefully selected advertising partners use industry standard
performance analysis, targetting techniques, and anti-fraud
strategies. Which is to say, we don't really know what they do, but it
probably involves the setting and tracking of cookies.
If this
bothers you, run AdBlock, disable JavaScript, disable cookies, and go
through an anonymizing proxy.
The terms and details of this privacy policy may of course be revised
at any time.
