Terms and conditions
Terms & Conditions for Personal Customers
(Terms and Conditions for Business Customers are shown below those for Personal Customers)
WWW.EYENETWATCH.COM TERMS OF BUSINESS FOR THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS BY PERSONAL CUSTOMERS. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY FORM A CONTRACT WHICH IS LEGALLY BINDING ON YOU.
YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN IN PARTICULAR TO THE PROVISIONS OF CLAUSE 10.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Welcome to our website (www.eyenetwatch.com) (the “Website“ or the “site”)
1.2 These terms and conditions apply to consumer customers only and not to business customers. For the purposes of these terms and conditions, a “consumer” is an individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession. If you are a business customer, our Terms & Conditions for Business Customers below will apply to you.
1.3 These terms and conditions (together with our Privacy Policy) tell you the legal terms and conditions on which we supply any of the products listed on our Website (“Products”) to you. These terms and conditions apply to any contract between us for the sale of Products to you from our Website (“Contract”). Please read these terms and conditions carefully, and ensure that you understand them, before ordering any Products from our site as they will be binding on you. You should understand that by ordering any of our Products, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
1.4 If you find yourself unable to agree to these terms and conditions please do not use our ordering service and we ask that you do not proceed to purchase any Products listed on the site.
2. INFORMATION ABOUT US
The Website operates as Eyenetwatch.com, a division of 5RL Internet Limited (“we”). We are registered in England and Wales under company number 08653204 and with our registered office at 16 Riverside, Omega Park, Alton, Hampshire, GU34 2UF. Our main trading address is the same as our registered office address. Our VAT number is GB 219 8871 64. Our EORI number for exports out of the UK is GB015815337000.
3. SERVICE AVAILABILITY
We accept orders for delivery worldwide. Orders outside of the UK mainland will require payment with order, unless previously agreed by us.
4. YOUR STATUS
By placing an order through our site, you warrant that:
4.1 You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and
4.2 You are at least 18 years old.
5. HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US
5.1 Before an order is placed you will be given an opportunity to verify and correct the Products included in your order. After placing an order via the Website, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. This acknowledgement is for your information and convenience only and this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and if we accept your order (or part of your order) we will indicate our acceptance to you by sending you an email confirming that we have dispatched your order (or part of it) (the “Order Confirmation”) and containing a VAT invoice (UK orders only) in respect of the Products dispatched. The Contract between us will be formed when we send you the Order Confirmation, whether or not you receive such email.
5.2 The Contract will relate only to those Products confirmed as dispatched in the Order Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Order Confirmation.
5.3 These terms and conditions apply to the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms that you seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
5.4 If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or is no longer available or because we cannot meet your requested delivery date, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Product, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible. We may also be unable to supply you with a Product if we discover a pricing error on our Website; please see conditions 8.4 and 8.5 for further information about what happens in these circumstances.
6. AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY
6.1 We will deliver the Products to the location set out in your order (“Delivery Address”). Delivery shall be completed once we deliver the Products to the Delivery Address and the Products will be your responsibility from that time. For some overseas orders we reserve the right to deliver in accordance with your delivery requirements, we also offer ex works, FOB and to certain airports for you to collect and pay any duties as required.
6.2 Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Order Confirmation or, as agreed with you separately in writing or if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days of the Order Confirmation. We can accept requests for specific delivery dates and times, but these will be agreed in advance by us.
6.3 Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control (as defined in condition 14). See condition 14 for our responsibilities when this happens. We shall not be liable to you for any delay in delivery that is caused by your failure to provide us with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Products.
6.4 We deliver worldwide. Our worldwide delivery partners will require a contact telephone number with all orders. This will be requested once we have received, reviewed and accepted your order.
6.5 We do not deliver to PO Box addresses. This is because our delivery partners do not offer this service.
6.6 If for any reason we are unable to deliver your order (or any part of it) within the period specified in our Order Confirmation (or if no period is specified then within 30 days of the date of the Order Confirmation), then we will contact you and you may choose to cancel the Contract and receive a full refund. In these circumstances, a full refund shall represent your sole remedy and our sole liability to you in relation to the non-delivery of the Products. If you choose to cancel the Contract for non-delivery under this condition 6.6, you may do so for just some of the Products or all of them, unless splitting them up would significantly reduce their value. If any Products have been delivered to you under the Contract, and you wish to cancel the Contract in its entirety, you will have to allow us to collect the delivered Products from you (at our cost). After you cancel the Contract (and we have collected from you any Products already delivered under the cancelled Contract), we will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Products and their delivery. Any refund due to you will be processed within 30 days of the date of your cancellation.
6.7 All deliveries must be signed for. If we are unable to obtain a signature at the time of delivery, we will leave you a note that the Products have been returned to us, in which case please contact us to rearrange delivery. In these circumstances, we shall not be liable to you for any loss you may suffer as a result of such non-delivery.
6.8 The delivery charges applicable to the Products are set out on the relevant Product page on our Website. We will usually inform you of the delivery charges at the time of your order but, if these cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, we will notify you of the delivery charges by email afterwards and give you an opportunity to confirm whether or not you want to proceed with your order.
6.9 Please note that our couriers are only insured to deliver to the ground floor of buildings. You will be responsible for arranging transportation of the Products to levels above the ground floor, so please bear this in mind if you are ordering large quantities or heavy items. Additionally, it is your responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient access to the Delivery Location (for example, sufficient door widths) to enable delivery of the Product. Please inform us of any access issues at the time you place the order.
6.10 If we are not able to deliver the whole of the order at one time due to operational reasons or shortage of stock, we will deliver the order in instalments. We will not charge you extra delivery costs for this.
7. RISK AND TITLE
The Products will be your responsibility from the time of delivery. Ownership will pass to you when we receive payment in full (including all delivery charges) for the Products ordered.
8. PRICE AND PAYMENT
8.1 The price of any Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.
8.2 These prices exclude VAT and delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due.
8.3 Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you an Order Confirmation.
8.4 Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. If, within a reasonable time after you placed your order, we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you by email.
8.5 We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an Order Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.
8.6 Payment for all Products must be by credit card, debit card, Paypal, bank transfer or cheque. We accept card payments with Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Debit, Visa Electron and Amex. We will charge your credit or debit card when you place your order in accordance with our ordering process which requires payment with order, unless previously agreed by us. Paypal payments will be taken at the time you place your order, but the processing of your payment will not constitute our acceptance of your order, which will occur as set out in condition 5.
9. OUR REFUNDS AND RETURNS POLICY
9.1 As a consumer, you have the legal right under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (“Regulations”) (applies to UK based purchases only) to cancel the Contract at any time up to the date 14 days after the day on which you have received the Products (“Cancellation Period”), subject to certain exceptions listed in conditions 9.6 and 9.7 below. This means that during the Cancellation Period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want to receive or keep the Products, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund. For example, if the Contract is formed on 1 January (i.e. the date we sent you the Order Confirmation) and you receive the Products on 5 January, you may cancel the Contract at any time between 1 January and the end of the day on 19 January.
9.2 To cancel the Contract under the Regulations, you must let us know about your decision to cancel. The quickest and easiest way to do this is to contact us via our website, by email or by telephone. You can also contact us by post using the contact details set out in condition 12 below. If writing to us, please include details of the Contract (such as the Products ordered, the purchase price and the date of the order) to help us identify it. If you send your cancellation notice via our website or by post, then the cancellation is effective from the date that you sent the query or posted the letter. For example, notice will be in time as long as the notice is in the last post on the last day of the Cancellation Period or emailed to us before midnight on that day. If you send your cancellation notice via our website or by post, we will email you to confirm receipt and provide a returns number to include with the Product.
9.3 If you cancel the Contract under the Regulations, we will refund the price you paid for the Products and any delivery charges and will arrange for courier collection of the Products at our cost. However, please note that we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the Products, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the Products and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.
9.4 Refunds for cancellations under the Regulations will be completed as soon as possible but in any event within 14 days after the day on which you informed us of your decision to cancel the Contract.
9.5 Except where the Products are defective or not as described, your right to cancel the Contract under the Regulations does not apply to the following:
9.5.1 Products which have been personalised or made to your specification;
9.6 Your right to cancel the Contract under the Regulations also does not apply to the supply of digital content not on a tangible medium (including, without limitation, downloadable computer software) where you ask us to supply such digital content to you during the Cancellation Period, which you will do at the time of placing your order. You expressly acknowledge that by placing your order, and thereby requesting that we supply digital content to you during the Cancellation Period, your right to cancel the Contract will be lost.
9.7 Unless the Products are defective or not as described (in which case see condition 9.10), you are not entitled to cancel the Contract under the Regulations after the expiry of the Cancellation Period. However, although we are under no obligation to accept a return after the Cancellation Period, we may exercise our discretion to do so, provided that in these circumstances you might not receive a full credit in respect of the price you paid for the Products and your refund may be by way of a credit note. Unless the Products are defective or not as described, no returns will be accepted under any circumstances after the expiry of 28 days following delivery of the Products to you.
9.8 All refunds will be processed to the payment method you used to make the original payment, save that if condition 9.7 applies, you may receive a credit note.
9.9 In addition to your cancellation rights under the Regulations, you have a legal right to reject goods which are defective or not as described. If you wish to return a Product because it is defective or not as described, you must contact us within five working days of receipt or, if a defect is not immediately apparent, within a reasonable time of discovering the defect. What is considered a reasonable time will depend on the nature of the Product and the nature of the defect and you are strongly advised to inspect all Products immediately on receipt. Provided you notify us in accordance with the above timescales, we will contact you with a returns number and arrange for collection at our cost. Once we have received the Products back to our warehouse, we will inspect them and notify you of the outcome of our inspection by email within a reasonable time. If the Products are found to be defective or not as described, we will refund the price of the Products together with any applicable VAT and delivery charges. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via email that you were entitled to a refund.
9.10 We are under a legal duty to supply consumers with Products that are in conformity with the Contract. As a consumer, you have additional legal rights in relation to goods that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by anything in these terms and conditions. Advice about the legal rights of consumers is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.
9.11 If you consider there to be a shortage in your order you must contact us within five working days of delivery, failing which you will be deemed to have received the Products in the quantities ordered and shall not be entitled to cancel the order. You are therefore strongly advised to inspect all Products immediately on receipt. Provided you notify us of the shortage within the required timescale, we will contact you with a returns number and arrange for collection at our cost. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via email that you were entitled to a refund. Products returned by you under this condition 9.11 will be refunded in full together with any applicable VAT and delivery charges.

15.2 A waiver by us of any default shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default.
15.3 No waiver by us of any of these terms and conditions shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing in accordance with condition 12.
16. SEVERABILITY
If any of these terms and conditions or any provisions of a Contract are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms and conditions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.

3. SERVICE AVAILABILITY
Our site is intended for use by people who require worldwide delivery.
4. YOUR STATUS
By placing an order through our site, you warrant that you have authority to bind any business on whose behalf you use our site to purchase Products.
5. HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND US
5.1 Before an order is placed you will be given an opportunity to verify and correct the Products included in your order. After placing an order via the Website, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. This acknowledgement is for your information and convenience only and this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and if we accept your order (or part of your order) we will indicate our acceptance to you by sending you an email confirming that we have dispatched your order (or part of it) (the “Order Confirmation”) and containing a VAT (where applicable) invoice in respect of the Products dispatched. The Contract between us will be formed when we send you the Order Confirmation, whether or not you receive such email.
5.2 The Contract will relate only to those Products confirmed as dispatched in the Order Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Order Confirmation.
5.3 These terms and conditions apply to the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms that you seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
5.4 If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or is no longer available or because we cannot meet your requested delivery date, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Product, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible. We may also be unable to supply you with a Product if we discover that it is incorrectly priced on our Website; please see conditions 8.4 and 8.5 for further information about what happens in these circumstances.
6. AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY
6.1 We will deliver the Products to the location set out in your order (“Delivery Address”). Delivery shall be completed once we deliver the Products to the Delivery Location and the Products will be your responsibility from that time. For some overseas orders we reserve the right to deliver in accordance with your delivery requirements, we also offer ex works, FOB and to certain airports for you to collect and pay any duties as required.
6.2 Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Order Confirmation or, as agreed with you separately in writing or if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days of the Order Confirmation. We can accept requests for specific delivery dates and times, but these will be agreed in advance by us.
6.3 Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control (as defined in condition 14). See condition 14 for our responsibilities when this happens. We shall not be liable for any delay in delivery that is caused by your failure to provide us with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Products.
6.4 We deliver worldwide. Our worldwide delivery partners will require a contact telephone number with all orders. This will be requested once we have received, reviewed and accepted your order. We do not deliver to PO Box addresses.
6.5 We may substitute Products within your order with equivalent Products of an equivalent price, we will contact you prior to dispatching your order should this be necessary.
6.6 If for any reason we are unable to deliver your order (or any part of it) within the period specified in our Order Confirmation (or if no period is specified then within 30 days of the date of our Order Confirmation), then we will contact you and you may choose to cancel your order and receive a full refund. In these circumstances, a full refund shall represent your sole remedy and our sole liability to you in relation to the non-delivery of the Products. If you choose to cancel the Contract for non-delivery under this condition 6.6, you may do so for just some of the Products or all of them, unless splitting them up would significantly reduce their value. If any Products have been delivered to you under the Contract, and you wish to cancel the Contract in its entirety, you will have to allow us to collect the delivered Products from you (at our cost). After you cancel the Contract (and we have collected from you any Products already delivered under the cancelled Contract), we will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Products and their delivery. Any refund due to you will be processed within 30 days of the date of your cancellation.
6.7 All deliveries must be signed for. If we are unable to obtain a signature at the time of delivery, we will leave you a note that the Products have been returned to us, in which case please contact us to rearrange delivery. In these circumstances, we shall not be liable to you for any loss you may suffer as a result of such non-delivery.
6.8 The delivery charges applicable to the Products are set out on the relevant Product page on our Website. We will usually inform you of the delivery charges at the time of your order but, if these cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, we will notify you of the delivery charges by email afterwards and give you an opportunity to confirm whether or not you want to proceed with your order.
6.9 Please note that our couriers are only insured to deliver to the ground floor of buildings. You will be responsible for arranging transportation of the Products to levels above the ground floor, so please bear this in mind if you are ordering large quantities or heavy items. Additionally, it is your responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient access to the Delivery Location (for example, sufficient door widths) to enable delivery of the Product. Please inform us of any access issues at the time you place the order.
6.10 If we are not able to deliver the whole of the order at one time due to operational reasons or shortage of stock, we will deliver the order in instalments. We will not charge you extra delivery costs for this.
7. RISK AND TITLE
7.1 The Products will be at your risk from the time of delivery.
7.2 Ownership of the Products will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of:
7.2.1 such Products (including delivery charges); and
7.2.2 all other sums which are or which become due to us from you for sales of Products (including delivery charges) through our Website.
7.3 Until title to Products has passed to you, you shall:
7.3.1 hold such Products on a fiduciary basis as our bailee;
7.3.2 store such Products separately from all other goods held by you so that they remain readily identifiable as our property;
7.3.3 not remove, deface or obscure any identifying mark or packaging on or relating to such Products; and
7.3.4 maintain the Products in satisfactory condition from the date of delivery.
7.4 If before title to Products passes to you:
7.4.1 you fail to pay any amount due to us for Products on the due date for payment; or
7.4.2 you suspend, or threaten to suspend, payment of your debts or you are or are deemed to be, insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay your debts as they fall due for payment, or you admit inability to pay your debts or are deemed unable to pay your debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1996 (UK orders only), or you commence negotiations with all or any class of your creditors with a view to rescheduling any of your debts, or you enter into any composition or arrangement with your creditors generally; or
7.4.3 an order is made, a resolution is passed, or a notice is issued convening a meeting for the purpose of passing a resolution, or any analogous proceedings are taken, for your winding-up, administration or dissolution; or
7.4.4 any liquidator, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator or similar officer is appointed over, or in respect of, you or any part of your business or assets then without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have,
we may at any time require you to deliver up such Products and, if you fail to do so promptly, we may enter any of your premises where the relevant Products are stored in order to recover them.
8. PRICE AND PAYMENT
8.1 The price of any Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.
8.2 These prices exclude VAT and delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due.
8.3 Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you an Order Confirmation.
8.4 Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. If, within a reasonable time after you placed your order, we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you by email.
8.5 We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an Order Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.
8.6 Payment for all Products must be by credit card, debit card, Paypal, bank transfer or cheque, unless you have a credit facility with us. We accept card payments with Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Debit, Visa Electron and Amex. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch your order. Paypal payments will be taken at the time you place your order, but the processing of your payment will not constitute our acceptance of your order, which will occur as set out in condition 5.
8.7 If we have granted a credit facility to you then payment for all Products must be received by us within 30 days of the date of our VAT invoice, which we will send to you by email.
8.8 Time for payment shall be of the essence of the Contract.
8.9 You will pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (except for any deduction or withholding required by law). We may at any time, without limiting any other rights or remedies we may have, set off any amount owing to us by you against any amount payable by us to you.
8.10 By placing an order for Products with us, you acknowledge and agree that your obligation to pay our invoices is not conditional on our completion of a purchase order or any other form or documentation provided by you and we will be under no obligation to complete any such forms or documentation as a condition of receiving payment.
8.11 Any amounts disputed in good faith may be deducted from the relevant invoice and the remainder must be paid by the due date. You must notify us of any dispute in writing within 14 days of receipt of the invoice, giving your reasons for withholding payment. Upon receipt of your notice, you will work together with us in good faith to resolve the dispute. You agree to pay any disputed amounts found to be payable within five days of the resolution of the dispute.
8.12 If you fail to make any payment due to us by the due date for payment, then, without limiting any other remedies available to us, you shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate provided in the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount. In relation to payments disputed in good faith, interest under this condition 8.12 is payable only after the dispute is resolved, on sums found or agreed to be due, from the due date until payment. If you have a credit facility and you fail to make payment when it is due, then we may withdraw your credit facility with immediate effect on giving you written notice.
8.13 If you fail to make any payment to us by the due date for payment, you agree to reimburse us fully for any costs and expenses (including reasonable legal and other professional fees) we incur or pay arising from your failure to make the payment and our subsequent efforts to recover the amounts due. By way of example, such costs and expenses may include solicitors’ fees, court fees and the cost of appointing third-party debt collection agencies.
9. OUR REFUNDS AND RETURNS POLICY
9.1 You may choose to return a Product for any reason provided that:
9.1.1 you notify us of your desire to return the Product within 14 days of receipt, using the contact details in condition 12; and
9.1.2 we receive the Product in a resalable condition - it needs to still be in its original unopened packaging unmarked.
9.2 If the terms of condition 9.1 apply then we will contact you with a returns number and we will arrange for collection at our cost. Once the Products are back at our warehouse and we have had an opportunity to inspect them to check that they are in resalable condition in accordance with condition 9.1.2 we will then process the refund. The refund will be the price of the Product, including any VAT and delivery charges paid, and will be processed as soon as possible and in any case within 14 days of us receiving the Products in our warehouse.
9.3 Unless the Products are defective or not as described (in which case see condition 9.4), you are not entitled to return a Product outside the 14-day period. However, although we are under no obligation to accept a return after expiry of the 14-day period, we may do so at our sole discretion, provided that you may not receive a full credit in respect of the price you paid for the Products and your refund may be by way of a credit note. Unless the Products are defective or not as described, no returns will be accepted under any circumstances after the expiry of 28 days following delivery of the Products to you.
9.4 If you wish to return a Product because it is defective or not as described, you must contact us within five working days of receipt or, if a defect is not immediately apparent, within a reasonable time of discovering the defect. What is considered a reasonable time will depend on the nature of the Product and the nature of the defect and you are strongly advised to inspect all Products immediately on receipt. Provided you notify us in accordance with the above timescales, we will contact you with a returns number and arrange for collection at our cost. Once we have received the Products back to our warehouse, we will inspect them and notify you of the outcome of our inspection via email within a reasonable time. If the Products are found to be defective or not as described, we will refund the price of the Products together with any applicable VAT and delivery charges. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via email that you were entitled to a refund.
9.5 If you consider there to be a shortage in your order you must contact us within five working days of delivery, failing which you will be deemed to have received the Products in the quantities ordered and shall not be entitled to cancel the order. You are therefore strongly advised to inspect all Products immediately on receipt. Provided you notify us of the shortage within the required timescale, we will contact you with a returns number and arrange for collection at our cost. We will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via email that you were entitled to a refund. Products returned by you under this condition 9.5 will be refunded in full together with any applicable VAT and delivery charges.
9.6 All refunds will be processed to the payment method you used to make the original payment, save that if condition 9.3 applies, you may receive a credit note.
