PRIVACY POLICY FOR ROLET INTERNET SERVICES, INC
General
Rolet respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites, responds to our interactive advertisements or sends us e-mail. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Rolet will collect and how we will use that information. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit Rolet Web sites, respond to our Web-based advertisements or send us email.
Security
All order forms on rolet.com utilize a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to provide "secure sessions" for our visitors. Through the "secure session," information that you input into a rolet.com order form will be sent and will arrive privately and unaltered at a Rolet server. This security prohibits other companies and Web users from being able to access your information.
Personally-Identifiable Information
Rolet will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.
The following are some examples of when Rolet may require that you provide personally-identifiable information:
To complete an online order for a product or service (if you do not wish to complete an online order form, we will always provide an option for you to complete an order by calling our office number listed at the bottom of this Statement)
To enter an online contest or sweepstakes (if you do not wish to complete an online contest or sweepstakes form, we will always provide an option for you to enter by mailing a 3 x 5 card to a specific address)
to request more information about new or current Rolet products or services
If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files.
When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise:
We may store and process that information to better understand all customer needs and how we can improve our products and services for all customers
We may use that information to contact you with new promotions and announcements if you have previously provided your permission and if the promotions and announcements are in your interest
We may contact you if we have questions about your account
Rolet will not sell personally-identifiable information to third parties, unless stated at the time of collection. We may share information with business partners. We are committed to giving you the choice whether or not we use your information for marketing purposes or share information with business partners.
