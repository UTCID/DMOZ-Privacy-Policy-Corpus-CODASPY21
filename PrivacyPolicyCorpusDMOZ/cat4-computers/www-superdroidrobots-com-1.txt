Advertisements: SuperDroidRobots.com does not show pop-up, pop-under or pop-whatever ads of any kind. We find them highly undesirable and therefore do not support the usage of these privacy intruding marketing techniques. We offer the advertiser a plethora of other options, which we find to be at least equally effective. If you have experienced pop-ups when entering SuperDroidRobots.com, or have found pop-unders after leaving SuperDroidRobots.com, you are either victim of the web site visited before us, or you are victim to spyware agents on your computer, which target their ads to show when you visit certain web sites (such as SuperDroidRobots.com).
