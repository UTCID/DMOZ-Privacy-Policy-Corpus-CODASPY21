WIN ENTERPRISES PRIVACY NOTICE
WIN Enterprises, Inc. ("WIN Enterprises") has created this privacy notice (“Privacy Notice” or “Notice”) to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The Privacy Notice describes our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website and WIN Enterprises’ products and services.
Information Collection and Use
In order to access certain products or services on our site, users may need to provide their contact information (such as name, company name, mailing address, and email address), which may be used to send orders, deliver the desired products or services, respond to customer service requests, provide alerts such as security updates or changes in our policies, and to send advertising or informational materials like newsletters or white papers, in accordance with your communication preferences.
Similarly, when you subscribe to a newsletter, create an account, make a purchase or request information from WIN Enterprises, we may ask for things like contact, billing, shipping and communication information, payment card or financial account data, and account ID or credentials in order to fulfill your request. If you attend a trade show or event or otherwise contact us, you may also voluntarily provide us with similar information. Depending on the service or product that we are providing, we may also collect additional information such as location data and specific technical information about the user's development environment to enhance product functionality and better understand the needs of our customers.
We may also obtain information through partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties. These enterprises largely fall into the following categories: marketing companies, data set and information vendors, public database providers, social media platforms, partners, providers of products or services, hosts or vendors at events or trade shows, research partners, customers and enterprises that deploy WIN Enterprises’ products or services. We take steps to confirm that information we receive from these third parties has been collected with your consent or that these parties are otherwise legally permitted to disclose your personal information to us.
IP addresses are automatically transmitted as part of any internet communication, and we use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website and to gather broad demographic information.
Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings or communications at any time by following the instructions set forth in the access/choice/opt-out section below.
