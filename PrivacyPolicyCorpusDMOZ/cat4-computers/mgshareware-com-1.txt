MGSHAREWARE PRIVACY POLICY
Policy Overview
This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the “MGSHAREWARE” and "FreeRIP" web sites at http://www.MGShareware.com and http://www.freerip.com. Except as provided in this statement, MGShareware will not disclose, sell or rent any personally identifiable information without the user’s proper consent. The MGShareware user is given final word on whether or not to share such information with MGShareware. Please use discretion, because MGShareware cannot be held accountable for the use, collection or distribution of personal information freely provided by users with any of our tools or services. Be aware that information provided spontaneously by the user in such ways is not under the control of MGShareware and might be observed, collected or utilized by third-party agencies and organizations. If you post your phone number in your profile (as an example) we cannot be held accountable for the consequences. For questions or concerns about our information and policy practices, contact the MGShareware Policy Manager as provided at the end of this policy.
Information Retention
To preserve the integrity of website databases MGShareware procedure is to retain information submitted by users for an indefinite length of time. By submitting information to MGShareware, you are consenting to store that information indefinitely. If required by applicable federal or state law, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA,) MGShareware will scramble and/or encrypt that information to make it unrecognizable. MGShareware will also respond to written user requests to scramble account information. If you wish to make such a request, which will require you to verify your identity, please contact the MGShareware Policy Manager.
Information Collection and Use
MGShareware will only require personally identifiable information at the time of registration (which may occur during comment submission or during other activities available on MGShareware). This information might include email address, gender, birth date, zip or postal code and the country of residence. This information is used to identify you as a unique user within MGShareware and will not be shared with any other party without your consent and notification.
Information about members that is not personally identifiable may be used anonymously for purposes of advertising, demographic collection, market research data, anonymous reporting and to better tailor our content and services to our user’s needs. This type of information will not include any data that identifies users as an individual, such as email address, home address or telephone number. If the user provides such information as part of an optional promotion, contest, survey or similar program they are subject to the separate privacy rules and expectations of each individual program.
In addition to on-site advertising, MGShareware may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide if you choose to receive such solicitations. The user is always able to ask MGShareware not to contact them with such information again. Users will not be included in promotions, contests, submission opportunities, solicitations or other programs unless they opt-in. If you receive unsolicited email from a MGShareware domain, please contact our Policy Manager.
Please note that MGShareware may be required to share information in order to investigate, prevent or enforce suspected or confirmed illegal activities, including without limitation: fraud, threat or potential threat to the physical safety of any person, violation of our Terms of Service and/or User Agreement or as otherwise permitted or required by law. MGShareware may also be required to disclose such information in order to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
