How Empathy Helps Kids Succeed
Sep 17, 2020
Michele Borba, author of UnSelfie: Why Empathetic Kids Succeed In Our All About Me World, explains why empathic kids enjoy better mental health and overall resiliency. The good news is empathy is easy to teach.
“Don’t tell your kids to do something, show them,” Michele says. “Ask yourself each night, if my child had only my behavior to watch today, what did they learn?”
Michele also discusses why empathy among young people is down and self-absorption is up, and what parents and educators can do to turn around the trend.
