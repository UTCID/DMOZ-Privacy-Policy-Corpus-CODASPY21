XQuery Tools
Stylus Studio® X16 XML is the world's leading XQuery development tool, with full feature support for XQuery Editing, XQuery Mapping, XQuery Debugging, XQuery Profiling, and even deploying XQuery applications.
Stylus Studio®'s XQuery tools and components are the industry's first and only to fully support the XQuery 1.0 recommendation of January 2007, and with new integrated support for
XML Converters, you can easily extend your XQuery applications to access any data source (relational, EDI, flat files, etc.)
in a standards-based way. (You can also build them piecemeal, via the Data Conversion API,
or holistically, via the XML Pipeline code generator.)
