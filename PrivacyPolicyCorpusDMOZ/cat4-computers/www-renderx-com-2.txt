Terms of Service
Terms of using any provided RenderX services within our web site.
1. Acceptance of Terms
RenderX provides this service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time
to time without notice to you. In addition, when using particular RenderX services, you and RenderX shall be subject to any
posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules
are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. RenderX may offer other services from time to time that may be governed
by different Terms of Services.
2. Description of Service
RenderX provides this service as a forum available to the general public for exchanging information and ideas about XEP and
its environment. By subscribing to our mailing list at xep-support@renderx.com you can start participating in such exchanges.
Both users and maintainers of XEP read the list regularly, and may help you start using the product as well as answer some
of your questions. To subscribe to the list, send an e-mail message to majordomo@renderx.com with words "subscribe xep-support"
in the body of the message.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of
new RenderX properties, shall be subject to the TOS.
You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that RenderX assumes no responsibility for the timeliness,
deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service
provider or airtime charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the
Service.
3. Your Registration Obligations
In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about
yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the
Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,
not current or incomplete, or RenderX has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current
or incomplete, RenderX has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of
the Service (or any portion thereof).
By registering with the Service, you certify that you are at least 18 years old.
4. Renderx Privacy Policy

full privacy policy at http://www.renderx.com/policy.html
5. Member Account, Password and Security
You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible
for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under
your password or account. You agree to immediately notify RenderX of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any
other breach of security. RenderX cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply
with this Section 5.
6. Member Conduct
You understand that all information, data, text, software, photographs, graphics, messages or other materials of any kind
("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content
originated. This means that you, and not RenderX, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit
or otherwise make available via the Service. RenderX does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does
not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed
to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will RenderX be liable in any way for any
Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind
incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.
You agree to not use the Service to:
a. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive,
harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically
or otherwise objectionable;
b. harm minors in any way;
c. impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a RenderX official, forum leader, guide or host, or falsely
state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
d. forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted through the
Service;
e. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that you do not have a right to make available under
any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information

f. upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret,
copyright or other proprietary rights ("Rights") of any party;

code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or
telecommunications equipment;
i. interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures,

the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting
the foregoing, RenderX and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise
objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any
reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely
on any Content created by RenderX or submitted to RenderX.
You acknowledge and agree that RenderX may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or in
the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b)
enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property,
or personal safety of RenderX, its users and the public.
You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions
over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
7. Special Admonitions for International Use
You agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Specifically, you agree to comply
with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which
you reside.
8. Content Submitted or Made Available for Inclusion on the Service

royalty free, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,
publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works
in any format or medium now known or later developed.
9. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold RenderX, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners,
and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or

to the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.

use of the Service, or access to the Service.

not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.

for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Content available
on or through any such site or resource.
