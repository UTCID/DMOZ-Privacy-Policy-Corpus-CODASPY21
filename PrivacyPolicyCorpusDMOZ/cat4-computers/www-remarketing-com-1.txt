How do we use the information we collect?
The data that Remarketing.com collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to individuals across the different websites they visit. Remarketing.com also uses data to predict advertisement responses and to help determine which ads perform best.
If a user voluntarily provides Remarketing.com with personally identifiable information (“PII”) by way of email or by completing an online form, Remarketing.com will only use that PII to contact the user and respond to that user’s inquiry.
Data Collected from our Services
Users should also be aware that advertisements provided by Remarketing.com may direct users to websites of third-party advertisers, and such third party advertisers are not subject to this privacy policy. Users should carefully review the privacy policies of those websites they visit to assess the security of any PII they disclose.
To better customize the online user experience and provide Remarketing.com customers with useful statistics and analysis regarding their websites and advertisements, Remarketing.commay collect certain anonymous information (i.e., information that is not linked to PII), including, but not limited to, usage information, transaction information, IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, mouse position, scroll position and time on page. Remarketing.com may use such information to analyze trends, administer its site and provide its services, customize the advertising and content users may see, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Remarketing.com collects data on behalf of its customers that use its software. Under the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (“GDPR”), Remarketing.com is a data “processor” for its customers. That means that Remarketing.com only processes data upon customer direction and pursuant to customer instructions. If you are an EU subject and have a data subject request, please contact us at Remarketing.com and we will work with you to ensure that any data held by us about you is appropriately updated, or deleted. We process all data at our data centers, which are located in the United States.
What security measures does Remarketing.com use to protect the information that it collects?
Remarketing.com takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unauthorized alteration, disclosure and/or destruction of data. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use. This also includes, but is not limited to, using encryption. Any data stored on Remarketing.com servers is treated as confidential and is not available to the public. Remarketing.com has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
What about children’s privacy?
Remarketing.com is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy. Remarketing.com and its site and service are not developed for or directed at children. If you believe a child has provided Remarketing.com with PII and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us at tech@remarketing.com
Does Remarketing.com share the information that it collects with anyone?

These third parties may have access to your data but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Remarketing.com may release data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of Remarketing.com, our employees, users, or others.

Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy
Through cookies placed on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you are no longer using Remarketing.com services. Just like any other useful information we collect, this information allows us to improve the services Remarketing.com provides and customize your online experience.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Remarketing.com does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using our services and thereafter. Please note that this is Remarketing.com Do Not Track policy, and we cannot – and do not – make any promises about how third parties react when you set a “do not track” signal on your browser.
