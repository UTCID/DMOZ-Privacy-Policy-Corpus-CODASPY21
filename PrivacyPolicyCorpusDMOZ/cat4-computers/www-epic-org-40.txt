Spotlight on Surveillance
November
2005:
Facial Recognition Systems Have an Ugly Effect on Personal Privacy
The federal government is spending an increasing amount of
money on surveillance technology and programs at the expense of other projects.
EPIC's "Spotlight on Surveillance" project scrutinizes these surveillance
programs. For more information, see previous
Spotlights on Surveillance.1
This
month, Spotlight focuses upon the government’s use of facial recognition
systems.2 The Departments
of State, Energy, Justice and Defense have spent at least $47 million on such
systems.3 In
Fiscal Year 2006, the federal government plans to add facial recognition checks
to all visa applications, which already include fingerprint biometrics.4 This
is despite the Government Accountability Office’s estimate that incorporating
biometric systems into visas would cost from $1.3 billion to $2.9 billion for
startup, and $700 million to $1.5 billion for annual operating costs.5 Federal
funds have been used by cities and states to buy facial recognition devices
for motor vehicle and police departments.6 New
U.S. passports and national identification cards created under the REAL ID Act
of 2005 will both include digital photographs that can be linked to facial recognition
systems.7 However, several
tests, including those conducted by the National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST) and the Department of Defense, show that facial recognition
systems can be easily befuddled by uncooperative subjects and changes in the
environment, such as positioning or lighting.8 Such
facial recognition systems create significant privacy risks because the technique
is surreptitious, the prospects for extensive profiling are clear, and there
are no laws that currently regulate these systems to prevent abuse.
Face
recognition technology vendor Identix admits that when
there
is an angle difference between images "[f]rom 15 to
35
degrees, the face recognition discrimination power decreases,"
and "[a]ngled
faces beyond 35 degrees do not match well to
frontal faces
with" its current technology. See Identix's
FAQs
about facial recognition (pdf).

In simplified terms, a facial recognition system compares a digital pattern
(a computerized estimate) of the face of a person walking down the
street or standing in a crowd to images stored in databases. Changes in
the environment, such as positioning, lighting and shadows, can affect biometric
data collection.9 Changes
in facial expression, angle of head to camera, hairstyle, and beards
are particularly effective at confounding facial recognition systems.10 In
one test, the Government Accountability Office found that a person “moving
his head slightly left and right also fooled the system.”11 The
Defense Department’s face recognition technology tests found that
a 45-degree difference in position between the current and database
images renders the technology ineffective, and a 15-degree difference
is all that is needed to adversely affect the facial recognition technology.12
In
Congressional testimony, EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg said
the effectiveness of a system of biometric identification would be determined
by how the system is set up, protected and maintained.13 He
explained there are several ways to compromise the effectiveness of a biometric
system – by false identification at enrollment, physical alteration of a
personal biometric, stewing the sample collection by not cooperating, and hacking
into of falsifying data.14 Face recognition
system errors lead to innocent people being falsely matched to watchlists or
databases, and suspects being able to pass through the system unrecognized.
In 2002, NIST conducted a comprehensive study of facial recognition systems.
NIST found that the recognition rate for faces captured in uncontrolled
environments, such as outdoors, could be as low as 50%.15 NIST
also determined that, because of the high failure rates when applied to
large groups of people, facial recognition was not a viable technology
for “large-scale identification.”16 Time
also affects facial recognition systems. The longer the time between the
original photograph in the database and the new image captured, the less
likely the facial recognition system will make a correct match.17
According
to biometrics technology company Viisage, its
FaceFINDER system "scans
crowds of people and matches
individuals to selected faces previously
stored in an image
database," and "[w]ithout the visitor specifically
being
requested to look into the camera, the system can be
deployed
effectively."

Tampa is one of the U.S. cities that has used facial recognition technology
in concert with camera surveillance systems to surreptitiously scan
the public.18 Tampa used a facial
recognition camera system to scan the faces of people at the Super Bowl
in 2001, and the police department subsequently used such a system to
watch people in the Ybor City nightlife district.19 A
report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that:
[t]he system
has never correctly identified a single face in its database of suspects,
let alone resulted in any arrests … [and its] photographic
database contains a broader selection of the population that just criminals
wanted by the police, including such people as those who might have ‘valuable
intelligence’ for
the police or who have criminal records.20
In
August 2003, Tampa stopped using the system, supplied by Identix, because of
its failures. “It’s just proven not to have any benefit to us,” said
a police department spokesman.21
The mission
creep of the Tampa system is an example of the privacy risks created by such
facial recognition systems. What began as system to catch criminals became
a system to find people who might have information for which
the police are searching. That is a poor reason to invade the privacy of
the general public. With such systems, a person can be scanned without her
knowledge or consent. A person’s “suspect activity” may be
no more than walking around a popular nightlife area.
Boston’s Logan Airport ran two separate tests of face recognition
systems – supplied by Viisage Technology and Identix – in 2002.22 Both
systems had such high error rates that the airport dropped the technology.23 Facial
recognition systems also failed tests at airports in Dallas/Fort Worth,
Fresno, Calif., and Palm Beach County, Fla.24 One
glaring example of a facial recognition system failure occurred when
two people swapped passports at an Australia airport as a joke. Their
deception was not caught by the facial recognition systems.25 Yet
Australian authorities continue to test the technology, and the “trial” has
encompassed three years.26
Despite
this poor history, facial recognition systems still are being used. The
Defense Department spent $1.6 million to pay Identix for researching facial
recognition technology.27 The
Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles recently spent $1.5 million
in federal funds for facial recognition systems supplied by Digimarc.28 Virginia
Beach, Va. used $150,000 in federal funds, plus $50,000 of its own funds, for
a facial recognition technology-enabled camera surveillance system supplied by
Identix.29 The Texas Department of Public
Safety recently contracted with Identix to pay $1.8 million to upgrade its systems
to include facial recognition capabilities.30 Pinellas
County, Fla. used $8 million in federal grants to outfit patrol cars, jails and
an airport with computerized facial recognition systems supplied by Viisage Technology.31 The
Los Angeles police department is using handheld facial recognition devices supplied
Neven Visions.32 Once again, a person could
be merely walking down the street and have a facial recognition device focused
on her.
A
Department of Defense study shows that changes in lighting and
time lapse between the capture of each image can significantly
affect
face recognition performance.

The two major companies supplying face recognition technology are Massachusetts-based
Viisage Technology and Minnesota-based Identix. Identix’s technology
includes: FaceIt SDK, used in developing enrollment, one-to-one and one-to-many
applications; FaceIt Surveillance SDK, when added on to FaceIt SDK, used
to develop facial screening applications; FaceIt Quality Assessment SDK;
ABIS System, a web-based multi-biometric search engine used to conduct
one-to-many searches; FaceIt ARGUS, facial screening software for real-time
verification.33 Identix’s facial
recognition systems have not solved the technology’s failures. The
company admits that when there is an angle difference “[f]rom 15
to 35 degrees, the face recognitions discrimination power decreases,” and “[a]ngled
faces beyond 35 degrees do not match well to frontal faces with” its
current technology.34
Viisage’s facial recognition systems include: FaceEXPLORER for large
digital image database management, FaceTools SDK designed for non-distributed
environments, FaceFINDER for screening and surveillance, and FacePASS for access
control.35 Viisage’s
FaceFINDER system is especially troubling. The facial recognition system “scans
crowds of people and matches individuals to selected faces previously stored
in an image database,” and “[w]ithout the visitor specifically being
requested to look into the camera, the system can be deployed effectively.”36

Spotlight
on Surveillance has previously discussed the increasing use of camera surveillance
systems throughout the United States.37 Cities
such as Chicago and Baltimore used money from homeland security grants to create
networks of surveillance cameras to watch over the public in the streets, shopping
centers, at airports and more.38 However,
studies have found that such surveillance systems have little effect on crime,
and that it is more effective to place more officers on the streets and improve
lighting in high-crime areas.39
Facial
recognition software is also increasingly used internationally as well. The
International Civil Aviation Organization has set standards suggesting fingerprints
and face recognition technology be incorporated into all passports.40 The
United Kingdom, which has an extensive camera surveillance network, has added
face recognition technology to the system.41 London
has 200,000 cameras, and more than 4 million cameras have been deployed throughout
the country.42 It is estimated that
there is one camera for every 14 people, and the average Briton is seen by
300 cameras per day, according to estimates.43
The
State Department has recently issued new standards for U.S. passports that
mandate digital photographs. It could add these photographs to its current
large database of digital images, collected during the past 10 years from
passport applications submitted by 70 million Americans.44 The
recently passed REAL ID Act mandates digital photographs in its national
identification cards. Soon, every person who holds a U.S. passport or a REAL
ID card will have his or her face placed into a database. Internationally, “[t]here
are 1.2 billion digitized photos of people in databases around the world,” according
to the president of Identix.45
Facial
recognition systems have already been used in one test to scan crowds for
more than just suspected criminals or terrorists, but also for “such
people as those who might have ‘valuable intelligence’ for the
police,” whatever “valuable
intelligence” may mean. It is a small step for the government to take
to continually use the networks of facial recognition-enabled surveillance
cameras to surreptitiously search crowds for anyone in a database containing
millions of people’s faces, though they are suspected of no crime and
no legal basis to monitor them has been established.
EPIC recommends that
funding for these systems be suspended until a comprehensive evaluation of
their utility and effectiveness is completed. EPIC further recommends that
a Privacy Impact Assessment that specifically examines the likelihood of “mission
creep” be conducted before any facial recognition system is deployed.
Finally, EPIC recommends that legal guidelines are established for the use
of facial recognition systems.
