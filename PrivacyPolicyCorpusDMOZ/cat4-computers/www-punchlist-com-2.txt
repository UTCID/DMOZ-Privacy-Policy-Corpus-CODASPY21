1. The Punch List Platform Connects Contractors and Homeowners
The Punch List Platform is a mobile application-based project management and communications platform which enables connections between Homeowners and Contractors. “Homeowners” are individual homeowners and/or individuals, such as renters or agents, with authorization from the homeowner seeking to obtain contractor, remodeling or other home construction services (“Construction Services”) from Contractors and are therefore clients of Contractors, and “Contractors” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Construction Services for Homeowners. Homeowners and Contractors together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.” If you agree on the terms of a Construction Service with another User, you and such other User form a Construction Agreement (as defined below) directly between the two of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.
CONTRACTORS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF HOMEOWNERS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR FRANCHISEES OF PUNCH LIST. PUNCH LIST DOES NOT PERFORM CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM SERVICES. USERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PUNCH LIST DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR A CONTRACTOR’S WORK AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE WORK PERFORMED AND THE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE.
The Punch List Platform only enables project management and communication between Users for the fulfillment of Construction Services. Punch List is not responsible for the performance or communications of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Construction Services, Contractors, Homeowners, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users, or of any ratings provided by Users with respect to each other. Punch List makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Construction Services requested or Construction Services provided by, or the communications of or between, Users identified through the Punch List Platform, whether in public, private, or offline interactions or otherwise howsoever.
2. User Vetting and User Representations and WarrantiesLicenses
Contractors alone are responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations before offering services and undertaking Construction Services. Indeed, certain types of Construction Services and services may be prohibited altogether, and it is the responsibility of Contractors to avoid such prohibited Construction Services and services. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement. If you have questions about how local laws apply to a Construction Service, you can and should first seek separate legal guidance.
Because Punch List does not oversee, monitor or supervise the posting, scoping or performance of Construction Services, Homeowners must determine for themselves whether a Contractor is qualified to perform the specific Construction Service at hand. Homeowners may wish to consult their state/provincial/territorial or local requirements to determine whether certain Construction Services are required to be performed by a licensed professional.
User Vetting
In Punch List’s sole discretion, Users may be subject to a vetting process before they can register for and during their use of the Punch List Platform, including but not limited to a verification of identity through third-party services as appropriate (“Identity Checks”). Although Punch List may perform Identity Checks, Punch List is not required to do so and cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Punch List cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of Identity Check information or any information provided through the Punch List Platform. Punch List has discretion to include or exclude potential Users based off of vetting process results.
When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety, data, and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. Punch List will not be liable for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the Punch List Platform. NEITHER PUNCH LIST NOR ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, INVESTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTATIVES, LICENSORS, INSURERS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS “PUNCH LIST AND AFFILIATES”) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, ACTS, OR OMISSIONS, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE PUNCH LIST PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE PUNCH LIST AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE PUNCH LIST PLATFORM.

You further represent and warrant that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy in order to access and use the Punch List Platform. You hereby warrant and represent that you will respect the privacy (including without limitation private, family, and home life), property and data protection rights of Users, and that you will not record (whether video or audio or otherwise) any Construction Service or any interaction by or with any User and/or Punch List in connection with the Punch List Platform without the prior written consent of Punch List and/or the relevant User, as applicable. You further represent and warrant that you will fulfill the commitments you make to other Users, including paying/receiving payment through the Punch List Platform using the PSP (as defined below), performing the Construction Service(s) agreed upon as between the Contractor and Homeowner, and only utilizing the third party payment processing system specified or approved by us to make or receive payment for the Construction Services (the “PSP”). You also represent and warrant that you will act professionally and responsibly in your interactions with other Users. You further represent and warrant that when using or accessing the Punch List Platform, you will act in accordance with any applicable local, state, or federal law or custom and in good faith.
You hereby warrant and represent that, other than as fully and promptly disclosed to Punch List as set forth below, you do not have any motivation, status, or interest which Punch List may reasonably wish to know about in connection with the Punch List Platform, including without limitation, if you are using or will or intend to use the Punch List Platform for any journalistic, investigative, or unlawful purpose. You hereby warrant and represent that you will promptly disclose to Punch List in writing any such motivation, status or interest, whether existing prior to registration or as arises during your use of the Punch List Platform.
By registering or using the Punch List Platform to offer, post, or provide Construction Services, as a Contractor, you represent and warrant that you, and your employees and Assistants (as defined below) who may perform work for you, are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed, certified, bonded, and insured, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which you may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which you offer your Construction Services and in relation to the specific job you are performing. Contractors additionally represent and warrant that you will provide timely, high-quality services to your Homeowners, you will only offer and provide services for which you have the necessary skills, expertise and, if applicable, license, and you will provide the Construction Services safely and in accordance with all applicable laws, and that you have the legal right to work in the country in which you are performing Construction Services.
Homeowners additionally represent and warrant that you either own the property for which Construction Services are being done, or are an authorized person (such as a renter or agent) by the homeowner to engage Contractors the Construction Services.
3. Contract between Homeowners and Contractors
You acknowledge and agree that a legally binding contract (the “Construction Agreement”) is formed when you agree on the terms of a Construction Service with another User. Homeowner and Contractor are responsible for abiding by contract formation laws and requirements and have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a written Construction Agreement with each other and with regard to the terms of any Construction Agreement, provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Punch List’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and provided that such agreements abide by required law. To the extent the Contractor chooses to use the Punch List Platform for project management and payment, the terms of the Construction Agreement shall be deemed to include the terms set forth in this Section 3.
The Construction Agreement is a contractual relationship directly between the Homeowner and Contractor and you agree that Punch List is not a party to any Construction Agreement and the formation of a Construction Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Punch List and the Contractor (or Assistants (as defined below)), nor will it create an employment relationship between the Homeowner and the Contractor (or Assistants). Punch List’s role is restricted solely limited to provide a place where the Homeowner and the Contractor may track the progress of the Construction Services and to facilitate payment between the parties using the PSP. In acting as the limited payment facilitation agent for particular Construction Services, Punch List disclaims any other agency or authority to act on behalf of the Contractor or the Homeowner, and assumes no liability or responsibility for any acts or omissions of the Contractor or the Homeowner, either within or outside of the Punch List Platform.
Where approved in advance by the Homeowner, the Contractor is not obligated to personally perform the Construction Services and may delegate any Construction Services to contractors, subcontractors, agents, assistants, or other personnel engaged by the Contractor (collectively “Assistants”). The Contractor assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of such Assistants, including without limitation the payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses of Assistants, if any, and for all required and applicable income tax withholdings as to the Provider and all persons engaged by the Provider in the performance of the Construction Services.
While using the Punch List Platform, Homeowners, in their sole discretion, determine whether they will be present or not when a Construction Service is performed and/or completed. Homeowners who elect not to be present when a Construction Service is performed and/or completed agree that if someone other than them (i.e. spouse, roommate, friend, etcetera) is present when the Construction Service is performed, they are appointing that person as their agent (“Homeowner’s Agent”) and the Contractor may take and follow direction from the Homeowner’s Agent as if such direction was given from the Homeowner him or herself.
The Homeowner shall pay their Contractor directly for the Construction Services through the PSP as indicated on the Punch List Platform at the rates agreed to by the parties in the Construction Agreement. Each User agrees to comply with the Construction Agreement and this Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Construction Service. Both Users agree to notify Punch List of any disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate any dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any proceeding. Punch List reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account pending the resolution of any dispute.
4. Billing and Payment
Users of the Punch List Platform contract for Construction Services directly with other Users. Payment for Construction Services is made directly from the Homeowner to the Contractor via the PSP, and not by or through Punch List. Homeowners will be solely responsible for paying for each Construction Service and Punch List is not obligated to pay Contractor for Homeowner’s failure to pay.
Users may be required to register with the PSP and agree to terms of service of the PSP (the “PSP Services Agreement”). Please note that Punch List is not a party to the PSP Services Agreement and has no obligation or liability to any User under the PSP Services Agreement.
Users of the Punch List Platform will be liable for any taxes required to be paid on the Construction Services provided under the Agreement.
5. Mobile App Updates and Upgrades
By installing one of the Apps, you consent to the installation of the App and any updates or upgrades that are released through the Punch List Platform. The App (including any updates or upgrades) may (i) cause your device to automatically communicate with Punch List’s servers to deliver the App functionality and to record usage metrics, (ii) affect App-related preferences or data stored your device, and (iii) collect personal information as set out in our Privacy Policy, including location information. You can uninstall the App at any time.
6. Termination and Suspension
Punch List may terminate or limit your right to use the Punch List Platform in the event that we are investigating or believe that you have breached any provision of this Agreement (a “User Breach”), by providing you with written or email notice. Such termination or limitation will be effective immediately upon delivery of such notice.  If Punch List terminates or limits your right to use the Punch List Platform pursuant to this Section 6, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party.
Even after your right to use the Punch List Platform is terminated or limited, this Agreement will remain enforceable against you. Punch List reserves the right to take appropriate legal action, including but not limited to pursuing arbitration in accordance with Section 16 of these Terms of Service.
Punch List reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Punch List Platform at its sole discretion. Punch List is not liable to you for any modification or discontinuance of all or any portion of the Punch List Platform. Punch List has the right to restrict anyone from completing registration as a Contractor if Punch List believes such person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Punch List Platform, or if, in Punch List’s discretion, such restriction is necessary to address any other reasonable business concern.
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Punch List Platform. All parts of this Agreement which by their nature should survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

16. Dispute Resolution – Arbitration & Class Action Waiver
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND PUNCH LIST CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND PUNCH LIST TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
(a) Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and Punch List (each a “Claim” and collectively “Claims”), you and Punch List agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those Claims expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. This pre-arbitration negotiation shall be initiated by providing written notice to the other party — including a brief written statement describing the name, address, and contact information of the notifying party, the facts giving rise to the Claim, and the relief requested. You must send such written notice to Punch List, Inc., 230 California Street, Suite 405, San Francisco, California 94111, Attention: Legal. If necessary to preserve a Claim under any applicable statute of limitations, you or Punch List may initiate arbitration while engaging in the informal negotiations.
During this pre-arbitration negotiation, all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties.
After a good faith effort to negotiate, if you or Punch List believe a Claim cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party, as specified in the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”).
(b) Agreement to Binding Arbitration
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND PUNCH LIST MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU (EXCEPT THOSE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED BELOW) IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
This agreement to arbitrate contained in this Section 16 (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives the termination of this Agreement and your relationship with Punch List.
Claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy whether based on past, present or future events arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof); the Punch List Platform; your relationship with Punch List; the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your Account or this Agreement; any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law; compensation, breaks and rests periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, emotional distress; any promotions or offers made by Punch List; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Punch List and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims.
If there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any Claim (including questions about the scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement), you and Punch List agree that this threshold dispute shall be delegated to the arbitrator (not a court) and that the arbitrator shall have initial authority to resolve such threshold disputes, except as expressly provided below.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND PUNCH LIST ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WHICH BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.
(c) Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Punch List agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between Punch List and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND PUNCH LIST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and Punch List otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to Private Attorney General Act Claims brought against Punch List, which are addressed separately in Section 16(d) below.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules (as defined below), disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.
(d) Representative PAGA Waiver
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (i) you and Punch List agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (ii) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and Punch List agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “Representative PAGA Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (1) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (2) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
(e) Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration
The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. You and Punch List agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.
As part of the arbitration, both you and Punch List will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:
If Punch List initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Punch List will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
If a Homeowner or Contractor files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, Punch List will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
If a Homeowner or Contractor files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, Punch List shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and the Homeowner or Contractor shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which they perform Construction Services, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.
Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.
Unless you and Punch List agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Punch List and a Contractor will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between Punch List and a Homeowner will take place in the county in which you received Construction Service. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.
(f) Exceptions to ArbitrationThe following types of Claims may be, but are not required to be, arbitrated under the Arbitration Agreement:
Claims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;
Small claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;
Applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders, including those relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
A representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 16(d) is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction; and
Claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of general law not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.
Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. However, you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Agreement. This Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.
(g) Severability
Except as otherwise provided in the severability provisions in Sections 16(c) and 16(d) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
(h) Right to Opt Out of Arbitration Agreement
If you are a Contractor, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying Punch List in writing within thirty (30) days of your agreement to these Terms of Service. To opt out, you must send a written notification to Punch List at Punch List, Inc., 230 California Street, Suite 405, San Francisco, California 9411, Attention: Legal, that includes (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provisions.
