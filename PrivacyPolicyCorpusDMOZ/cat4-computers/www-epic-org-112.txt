DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Privacy Office
Docket No. DHS-2005-0040
Notice of Privacy Act System of Records
The Automated Identification Management System COMMENTS OF THE ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER
On July 5, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") published
notice that it proposed to add a system of records, the Automated Identification
Management System (“AIDMS”),
to its inventory of record systems.
The AIDMS will be “used to facilitate and further automate processes for
entry into and exit from the United States through the issuance to covered
individuals, of a radio frequency identification tag with a unique identifier.”1 According
to the notice, these RFID tags will be embedded in the Form I-94 or Form I-94W,
which is the Arrival-Departure record issued to a traveler to the United States.
The AIDMS is part of an effort to expand the United States Visitor and Immigrant
Status Indicator Technology program (“US-VISIT”). Individuals subject
to US-VISIT are required to provide fingerscans, photographs, or other biometric
identifiers upon arrival in, or departure from, the United States. US-VISIT
has been implemented in “increments.” As part of “Increment
2,” US-VISIT will test the use of passive RFID tags to “automatically,
passively, and remotely” record the entry and exit of covered individuals.2
Pursuant to this notice, the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (“EPIC”) submits these comments to address the substantial privacy issues raised by the program’s proposal to use RFID-enabled I-94 forms to track the entry and exit of visitors. EPIC urges the Department of Homeland Security to abandon the use of “contactless” RFID technology in its I-94 forms; or, in the alternative, to delay such use until the findings of ongoing RFID testing are released and current privacy and security risks are eliminated. EPIC also opposes the proposed routine use exceptions that would clearly contravene the narrow purpose of automating the “processes
for entry into and exit from the United States.”
Introduction EPIC has submitted a series of comments on database proposals undertaken by the DHS regarding the development of the US-VISIT program. First, we wrote to urge DHS to determine how it will apply Privacy Act obligations to the program, to consider the significance of international privacy standards in the collection and use of personal information by the agency on non-U.S. citizens, and to prohibit the expansion of US-VISIT uses outside the program’s defined mission.3 Next, we warned DHS that, in its continued implementation of US-VISIT, it must further protect against the dangers of mission creep, evaluate the accuracy and security of its pilot program, and recognize a right of judicial review for individuals adversely affected by the program.4 Now, we write to urge the Department to reconsider this proposal to incorporate a “contactless” RFID tag in the form I-94.
DHS Should Abandon the Use of RFID Technology in US-VISIT Because
of Security and Privacy Threats The
US-VISIT program is testing the use of RFID technology for its data files. “The
purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be transmitted by a portable
device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according
to the needs of a particular application. The data transmitted by the tag may
provide identification or location information.”5 Under
US-VISIT, all aliens are subject to biometric collection, biographic data collection,
and watch list checks. The information collected from individuals includes
name, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship, passport number and country
of issuance, complete U.S. destination address, arrival and departure information,
a digital photograph, and digital fingerscans.6
According to the Privacy Act notice, “[t]he RFID tag, which will contain
a unique identification code, will be linked at a POE [point of entry] with
the biographic and biometric information that was collected when the traveler
entered the United States.” The
notice goes on to describe a seemingly narrow application for the RFID tag:
When travelers either drive or walk through the port-of-entry, a transceiver
will send out a harmless radio wave frequency that will power the DHS-issued
RFID tag to transmit back a unique identifier code number. This code number,
when received by the transceiver, will be relayed back to secure DHS computer
systems and matched with the biographic and/or biometric data of the traveler.
The RFID tag number will not contain or be derived from any personal information.
DHS will be able to automatically identify and document the exits and, if applicable,
the subsequent re-entry of covered individuals.7
DHS
is aware that the use of RFID tags in this context raises security and privacy
concerns. DHS states that after conducting an operational alternatives assessment,
passive RFID technology was determined to best satisfy the program’s needs.8 DHS
said passive RFID tags would: (1) protect personal privacy by controlling the
use of personal information outside of DHS systems; (2) minimize the surreptitious
tracking of travelers outside the port of entry because it does not constantly
transmit a signal; and (3) protect personal privacy by reading only a unique
number from an embedded chip in a new Form I-94.9 However,
the use of passive or active RFID tags in I-94 forms creates significant security
and privacy risks, particularly if individuals are not able to control the disclosure
of identifying information. Although DHS states that the RFID tags will only carry a unique identification
number, which will not contain any personally identifiable information, the
ID numbers are linked to data files, and are subject to interception.10 The
ID number is the key that permits access to records in the US-VISIT system. As
the Privacy Act notice states, “Information may be searched and retrieved
based on various data elements, including, but not limited to: RFID tag number,
traveler identification number, transaction number, and name of covered individual.”11
By their very design RFID tags, whether passive or active, are remotely and
secretly readable. Security expert Bruce Schneier noted, “Unfortunately,
RFID chips can be read by any reader, not just the ones at passport control.
The upshot of this is that travelers carrying around RFID passports are broadcasting
their identity.”12 This demonstrates
another security risk of the RFID-enabled I-94 form proposal, that of clandestine
tracking. DHS claims, “that the unencrypted RFID tag number will not be
structured in such a way that it can be used to identify the individual as
a non-immigrant,”13 This
is untrue. DHS itself said in July 7, 2005 revised Privacy Impact Assessment
that there is a risk that the RFID tag “could be used to conduct surreptitious
locational surveillance of an individual; i.e., to use the presence of the tag
to follow an individual as he or she moves about in the U.S.”14
Anytime a visitor is carrying his I-94 RFID-enabled form, his unique identification
number, which is linked to his individual biographic information, could be accessed
by unauthorized individuals. So long as the RFID tag or chip can be read by unauthorized
individuals, the person carrying that tag can be distinguished from any other
person carrying a different tag. Foreign visitors could be identified as such
merely because they carry an RFID-enabled I-94 form.
The problems with the proposal
to use RFID-enabled I-94 forms are very similar to the problems found in the
State Department’s flawed proposal to include
RFID tags in U.S. passports. The State Department is reassessing the plan after
receiving a storm of criticism. EPIC, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and
other groups, submitted comments urging the State Department to abandon its
proposal, because it would have made personal data contained in hi-tech passports
vulnerable to unauthorized access.15 Problems
in the passport proposal, which are also problems in the RFID-enabled I-94
form proposal, include skimming and eavesdropping. Skimming occurs when information
from an RFID chip is surreptitiously gathered by an unauthorized individual.
Eavesdropping occurs when an individual intercepts data as it is read by an
authorized RFID reader. Tests have shown that RFID tags can be read from thirty
feet or more, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access.16
RFID is an invisible technology. It allows a person’s information to be
accessed without his or her knowledge. The slight time-saving benefits of RFID-enabled
I-94 forms are heavily outweighed by the significant privacy and security risks.
In light of this, EPIC urges DHS to abandon the use of RFID in the US-VISIT
program. In the alternative, DHS should continue to assess the RFID I-94 card
and not implement it in the US-VISIT program until further results of testing
are completed and the security and privacy risks can be eliminated. The Proposed RFID Implementation
Lacks Basic Access Controls According to the Federal Register notice, the Department intends to test passive
RFID tags that will “automatically, passively, and remotely” record
the entry and exit of covered individuals (emphasis added).17 By
design, this system will enable the surreptitious monitoring of individuals,
and specifically the capture of identifying information without the individual’s
knowledge or consent.
This approach is contrary to the recommendation of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”). ICAO had earlier
proposed that strong security features be implemented in all machine-readable
travel documents.18 Specifically,
ICAO recommends incorporation of Basic Access Control (“BAC”) in
identification documents. ICAO explains, “[a] chip that is protected
by the Basic Access Control mechanism denies access to it’s [sic] contents
unless the inspection system can prove that it is authorized to access the
chip.”19
The authorization needed could be a secret key or password used to unlock
the data. To obtain the key, the Customs officer would need to physically
scan the machine-readable text that is printed on the RFID-enabled I-94 form.
The RFID tag reader would then hash the data to create a unique key that
could be used to authenticate the reader and unlock the data on the RFID
chip. BAC prevents skimming by preventing remote readers from accessing the
data on the document. The data cannot be read unless the document is physically
opened and scanned through a reader. It also prevents eavesdropping by encrypting
the communication channel that opens when data is sent from the chip to the
RFID reader. The BAC solution does not, however, solve all security and privacy
concerns.
The DHS should be fully aware by now of the problems with an RFID scheme
that lacks BAC. After the State Department received more than 2,400 comments
on its notice for proposed rulemaking on RFID passports,20 many
of which criticized its serious disregard of security and privacy safeguards,
the agency said it would implement a BAC that would prevent skimming and
eavesdropping, The RFID implementation proposed by DHS contravenes representations
made by the U.S. State Department regarding the incorporation of basic
security features into new U.S. passports. 21
The principle of Basic Access Control is critical to the design of identification
systems. Individuals, unlike commercial products with RFID tags, should
have the right to control the disclosure of their identifying information.
If the Department of Homeland Security does implement the RFID proposal,
it should at least incorporate Basic Access Control or equivalent security
features, into the RFID-enabled I-94 forms.
DHS Should Not Permit Routine Uses for an RFID Application that
is Simply Intended to Automatethe “processes for entry into and exit from
the United States”
The public notice about the AIDMS system of records states that, in addition
to those disclosures permitted under the Privacy Act, the “routine uses” of
the information would be seven broad uses set out by DHS.22 A
“routine
use” is a catch-all loophole in the Privacy Act that allows an agency to
disclose personal information to others without the individual’s consent.23 The
seven proposed uses, are:24 Disclosure to local, state, federal, tribal or foreign government
agencies or organizations engaged in collecting law enforcement or intelligence
information “and/or charged with investigating, prosecuting, enforcing,
or implementing civil and/or criminal laws, related rules, regulations, or
orders.”
Disclosure in court, grand jury, or adjudicative body proceedings
when records are determined by DHS to “be arguably relevant to the proceeding
where any of the following is a party: (1) The DHS, or any DHS component,
or subdivision thereof; (2) any DHS employee in his or her official capacity;
(3) any DHS employee in his or her individual capacity when the DHS has agreed
to represent the employee or has authorized a private attorney to represent
him or her; and (4) the United States, where the DHS or its components are
likely to be affected.
Disclosure “to a Member of Congress or staff acting
on the Member’s behalf when the Member or staff requests the information
on behalf of and at the request of the individual who is the subject of the
record.”
Disclosure to the “National Archives and Records Administration
or other Federal government agencies in records management inspections conducted
under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.”
Disclosure to the “news
media and the public when there exists a legitimate public interest in the
disclosure of the information or when disclosure is necessary to preserve
confidence in the integrity of the Department or is necessary to demonstrate
the accountability of the Department’s officers,
employees, or individuals covered by the system, except to the extent it
is determined that release of the specific information in the context of
a particular case would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Disclosure
to “contractors, grantees, experts, consultants,
students, and others performing or working on a contract, service, grant,
cooperative agreement, or other assignment for the Federal government,
when necessary to accomplish an agency function related to this system
of records.”
Disclosure to “an agency, organization, or individual
for the purposes of performing authorized audit or oversight operations.”
These broad exemptions clearly contravene the stated intent
of the AIDMS. If the purpose of this record system is to facilitate processing
for entry and exit at Points of Entry for the United States, then the additional
purpose set out above are unnecessary and exceed the purpose of the record
system. Accordingly, we urge that Department to revise the rule and remove
these proposed routine uses. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, EPIC urges the Department of Homeland Security to abandon the use of RFID technology in its I-94 forms; or, in the alternative, to delay such use until current privacy and security risks are eliminated.
