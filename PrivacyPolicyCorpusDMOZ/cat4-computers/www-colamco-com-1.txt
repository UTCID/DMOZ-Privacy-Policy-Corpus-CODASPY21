This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the products and services provided by COLAMCO to Customer.

COLAMCO may, at its sole option, revise the Agreement from time to time without notice to Customer by posting the revised Agreement terms on its web site. By ordering any product or service via this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Agreement, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time.

COLAMCO obtains content data from distributors, manufacturers, and content providers. While COLAMCO makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of this data, this web site may include technical or typographical errors. Product images do not necessarily represent the actual product. COLAMCO reserves the right to make changes to such data and this web site at any time. COLAMCO Inc. makes no warranty of any kind with respect to the data on or obtained from this web site, or the accuracy of advice given by COLAMCO employees, whether or not such advice is made in writing.

Pricing Information; Availability Disclaimer
Seller reserves the right to make adjustments to pricing, Products and Service offerings for reasons including, but not limited to, changing market conditions, Product discontinuation, Product unavailability, manufacturer price changes, supplier price changes and errors in advertisements. All orders are subject to Product availability and the availability of Personnel to perform the Services. Therefore, Seller cannot guarantee that it will be able to fulfill Customer’s orders even after orders and/or payments are accepted. If Services are being performed on a time and materials basis, any estimates provided by Seller are for planning purposes only.
Order Acceptance Policy
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. COLAMCO reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. COLAMCO reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. All placed orders must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may require additional verifications or information before processing any order.
Payment Terms, taxes, and other charges
Until accepted by COLAMCO, orders are not binding upon COLAMCO. Terms of payment are within COLAMCO’s sole discretion. Invoices are due and payable within the time period specified on the invoice, measured from the date of invoice issue. COLAMCO may invoice parts of an order separately. Customer agrees to pay interest on all past-due amounts at the lower of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month or at the highest rate allowed by law. Customer is responsible for, and will indemnify and hold COLAMCO harmless from, any applicable sales, use or other taxes associated with the order. Customer must claim any exemption from tax at the time of purchase and provide the necessary supporting documentation. Any sales, use or other applicable tax is based on the location to which the order is shipped. In the event of a payment default, Customer will be responsible for all of COLAMCO’s costs of collection, including but not limited to court costs, filing fees and attorney’s fees.
Sales Tax
COLAMCO collects sales taxes for the states of California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Washington D.C and Colorado. If you are tax exempt from California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Washington D.C or Colorado, please fax or email a copy of your sales tax certificate. Without a valid copy of your certificate, we are unable to waive the sales tax collection. Please note that we are not able to waive sales tax for Massachusetts.
Delivery
Products purchased on this web site will be delivered f. o. b. from COLAMCO’s warehouses or any of COLAMCO’s suppliers that are shipping directly to the customer on behalf of COLAMCO. The risk of loss shall pass to the customer when the product is delivered to the transportation carrier, regardless of who is responsible for transportation charges and terms of shipment. COLAMCO and our suppliers are not responsible for any damages during shipment. COLAMCO will use its best efforts to meet the delivery time stated at the time of order placement. Under no circumstance will COLAMCO guarantee product delivery at the stated time of order placement, nor are we responsible for any damages caused by the failure to meet the delivery time.
Cooperation
In addition to any specific Customer duties set forth in any applicable Statement of Work, Customer agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with performance of the Services by providing: (i) timely responses to Seller's inquiries and requests for approvals and authorizations, (ii) access to any information or materials reasonably requested by Seller which are necessary or useful as determined by Seller in connection with providing the Services, including, but not limited to, physical and computer access to Customer's computer systems, and (iii) all Required Consents necessary for Seller to provide the Services. "Required Consents" means consents or approvals required to give Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their subcontractors the right or license to access, use and modify all data and third party products. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Services are dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of information provided by Customer and the knowledge and cooperation of the agents, employees or subcontractors (“Personnel”) engaged or appointed by Customer who are selected by Customer to work with Seller.
Seller will follow all reasonable Customer security rules and procedures, as communicated in writing by Customer to Seller from time to time.
Products Purchased for Export
COLAMCO ships product only within the United States. If products are being purchased for purposes of export, customer is responsible and must obtain from the U.S. government certain export documentation before shipping to a foreign country. Some manufacturer’s warranties are valid only in the U.S. and may be invalid and void in a foreign country. Electrical and other standards vary from country to country; US product may be damaged if used with the incorrect electrical standards.
Resale
Products are available for purchase for Buyer's own personal use or to give as a gift, only. Resale of Products purchased under these Terms is expressly prohibited. This resale prohibition is a material condition to Buyer's rights under these Terms, and it is agreed that any direct or indirect distribution, transshipment and/or sale of Products by Buyer or others purchasing through Buyer will be a material breach of these Terms and will result in irreparable harm to COLAMCO for which money damages will not be adequate. In the event of such breach, the parties agree that COLAMCO, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law and/or in equity, will be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any threatened or continued breach, and to specifically protect and enforce this provision.
Warranties
COLAMCO is not the manufacturer of the products purchased by customer from COLAMCO. In purchasing the product, the customer is relying of the manufacturer’s specifications only and is not relying on any specifications, statements, photographs or other illustrations produced by COLAMCO. All products and or services provided by third parties are provided on an "as-is" basis, and COLAMCO makes no warranty with respect to such third party products or services. All products are subject to their respective manufacturers warranties and COLAMCO, its employees and representatives, to the fullest extent of the law, specifically disclaim any and all implied or expressed warranties relating to the products purchased on this web site, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, completeness, correctness, non-infringement, or fitness for any particular purpose.
Governing Law and Venue
This Agreement, the entire relationship between you and COLAMCO, and any litigation or other legal proceeding between you and COLAMCO (whether grounded in tort, contract, law or equity) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to its choice of law rules.
