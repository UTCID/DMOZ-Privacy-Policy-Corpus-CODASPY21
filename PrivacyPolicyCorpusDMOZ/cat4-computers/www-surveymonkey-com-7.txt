And just as our focus on privacy didn’t start on May 25, 2018 with GDPR, it doesn’t end there either. Privacy and transparency are lifelong commitments for SurveyMonkey.SurveyMonkey’s commitmentWe see privacy regulation as affording us yet another opportunity to continue our tradition of protecting and giving you more control over both your organizational and personal data.

As long as your account is active, you have full control over the specific types of data, and length of time you hold such data. For example, you can delete or export a single individual survey response from your account if required to do so. We honour all deletions from an account, and all account data which has been expunged by you is permanently deleted from our back-ups within 90 days.

No matter what area of our business you’re getting messages from, we’ve made it easy for you to choose which ones you see—or choose to see none at all.International data centreWe’re aware that many of our customers with EU users and EU affiliates would prefer that their data be hosted in the EU in mid-2019.
