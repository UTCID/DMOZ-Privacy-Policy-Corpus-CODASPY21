Privacy Policy
We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information about our customers. Personal information includes all of the personally identifying information that is provided to us. We are sensitive to these privacy interests and believes that protecting valuable personal/financial information is one of our most significant responsibilities.
The policies outlined below describe our policies to protect your privacy.
Use, Collection and Retention of Client Information
We collect, retain and use only the information about our customers that is required by law to administer our business and provide high level services to our clients. We retain this information no longer than necessary to meet these objectives. All transmitted credit card information is handled securely through digitally encrypted Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology.
Spam Policy
Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. Email spam targets individual users with direct mail messages and costs the sender very little to send. Most of the costs are paid for by the recipient or the carriers rather than by the sender.
We don't condone the use of spam and the sending of unsolicited email in any form, nor do we control other web sites involvement and/or practices in this area.
