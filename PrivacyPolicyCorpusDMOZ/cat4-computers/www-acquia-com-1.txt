Accountability for Onward Transfer
Acquia is accountable for personally identifiable information that we receive and subsequently transfer to third parties.

Contact information and Customer personally identifiable information is accessible only by those Acquia employees and consultants who have a reasonable need to access such information in order for us to fulfill contractual, legal and professional obligations.

In the event Acquia discloses personally identifiable information covered by this Policy to a non-agent third party, it will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects and any choice they have exercised regarding such disclosure. Acquia will only disclose personally identifiable information to third-party agents that have given us contractual assurances that they will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and the Principles and that they will process personally identifiable information for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the individual. If Acquia has knowledge that a third party to which it has disclosed personally identifiable information covered by this Privacy Policy is processing such personally identifiable information in a way that is contrary to this Privacy Policy and/or the Principles, Acquia will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. In such case, the third-party is liable for damages unless it is proven that Acquia is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.
Acquia may use from time to time a limited number of third-party service providers, contractors, and other businesses to assist us in providing our solutions to our customers or in meeting internal business operation needs. These third-parties may access process or store personally identifiable information in the course of performing their duties to Acquia.
