Sections to Follow A Brief History Who Must Comply Information Covered Individuals’ Rights Enforcement
A Brief History2018The California Consumer Privacy Act Signed Into Law and AmendedThe CCPA began as a ballot initiative sponsored by Californians for Consumer Privacy.  After obtaining the requisite signatures to qualify for the ballot, Californians for Consumer Privacy negotiated a legislative deal and withdrew the initiative. The CCPA was signed into law in June as Assembly Bill 375 (AB 375).As an attempt to clarify legislative intent and fix technical drafting errors in AB 375, the first round of amendments to the CCPA were passed in September 2018 in Senate Bill 1121. These amendments includedclarification about the age range that requires opt-in consent from a business (to cover only children under 16)changes to the definition of personal informationa narrowing of the ability for a consumer to recover damages in a private right of actiona delay in enforcement of the CCPA from January 2020 to July 20202019The California Consumer Privacy Act was AmendedWhile dozens of CCPA-related amendments were introduced in 2019, only five were signed into law. Assembly Bill 25 (AB 25)AB 25 clarified that the CCPA does not apply to personal information collected from job applicants, employees or contractors. Assembly Bill 874 (AB 874)AB 874 changed the definition of personal information to specifically exclude de-identified and aggregate information. It also modified the definition of publicly available, removing a requirement that publicly-available information be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose the data was originally collected or maintained.Assembly Bill 1146 (AB 1146)AB 1146 added an exception to the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information retained or shared between a new motor vehicle dealer and the vehicle’s manufacturer, if the information is shared for the purpose of carrying out a vehicle warranty or recall. It also provided an exception to the right to delete when the information that the business possesses is necessary to maintain in order to fill the terms of a written warranty or product recall. Assembly Bill 1355 (AB 1355)AB 1355 clarified that a business is permitted to treat consumers who exercise their rights differently when the differential treatment is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the consumer’s data. It also introduced an exception to the majority of the CCPA for any activity involving the collection, maintenance, disclosure, sale, communication or use of any personal information bearing on a consumer’s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living by certain parties (including consumer reporting agencies). Assembly Bill 1564 (AB 1564)AB 1564 modified the requirement that a business include two or more methods of contact for consumers to submit their access, deletion and opt-out requests including a toll-free telephone number (at a minimum). It also allowed businesses that operate exclusively online and that have a direct relationship with a consumer to forego a toll-free telephone number.2020The California Consumer Privacy Act Went Into EffectOn January 1, the CCPA went into effect providing California residents rights when dealing with businesses that collect and sell their personal information.
