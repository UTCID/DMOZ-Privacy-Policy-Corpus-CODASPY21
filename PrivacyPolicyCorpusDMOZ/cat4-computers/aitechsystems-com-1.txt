You may not be able to opt-out of receiving some of such service and billing messages.
We have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the service we provide and to make it relevant and personal to you.

These security measures include physical, electronic and procedural measures.

We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our services and protection of our users’ privacy. We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your account and content (where applicable) and avoid providing us with any sensitive information which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.

This may include having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EU. We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EU.

Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we maintain the Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your Information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
