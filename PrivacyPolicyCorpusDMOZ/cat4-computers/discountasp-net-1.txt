Other disclosures

Agents/Service Providers
In the course of providing the services to you, we use the services of third parties, such as credit card processing companies, to bill you for goods and services, a survey provider to send out surveys on our behalf, and a mass email provider to manage specific opt-in email lists. We also use a third party service provider software that we use to host our Support Portal.
When you order a new domain name, we will share your name, address, email and phone number with our domain registrar partner as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

It is possible that we may need to provide personally identifiable information to third party vendors that we use in order to provide our services – for example, we provide Microsoft based web hosting. It is possible that should we encounter an issue or bug with Microsoft software that can only be resolved by Microsoft, we may need to share personally identifiable information with Microsoft in order to replicate, troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Similarly, we offer email services using SmarterTools SmarterMail product. It is possible that we could encounter an email issue that must be researched by SmarterTools in order to provide us with a resolution, thus requiring us to provide SmarterTools with personally identifiable information. In these situations, we first ask the customer if we can share personally identifiable information with the third party.
