StoneEagle F&I, Inc. Privacy Policy
Published:  December 27, 2019
Section I – General Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting the StoneEagle F&I website. Please note that this General Privacy Policy describes our overall privacy practices for the website. Section II is our privacy policy for nonpublic personal information used in the provision of our services.
Please note that in the event we amend the Privacy Policy, posting the amended version will serve as notice to you of that change and the policy will note its effective date.
Some information collected is non-identifying. For example, although our website servers collect information about a user’s internet protocol address, our server is not able to automatically associate that information with a particular user. We may collect non-identifying information associated with that address, such as the time and date of a visit, the originating domain name, the browser type, and the particular pages or products viewed on the website.
The website may utilize a “cookie.” A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive or on your mobile device’s memory in order to collect information about your activities on our website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser to decline them. We use cookies on certain areas of our website, but these cookies are not used to identify anonymous website visitors. Our cookies enable you to proceed smoothly through our website and enable us to know whether you’ve used our website before to eliminate some steps that are directed to new visitors. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your use of our website and third party websites in order to determine your age and gender, which may be used to provide you with advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does not include your personal information.
Image tags work in conjunction with cookies. An image tag, also referred to as a clear GIF or web beacon, is a small image file that may be located on select areas of our website.
At this time, we have contracted with Google to collect information about how users navigate our website.
With respect to unrelated, third party web sites, such as third party online retailers, advertisers, or unrelated sites that we may happen to link to, or web sites that link to our website, those third parties may collect personal information directly from you. The information policies and practices of these unrelated parties are not covered by this privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties even if we may provide hyperlinks or other access to their web sites. We are not responsible or liable for their independent policies and practices. Please review their privacy policies and practices. It is your responsibility to review them and decide if you are satisfied with their protections.
We receive certain personally identifying information that is delivered to us by the dealership management systems, menu presentation systems and/or administration systems.
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We do not provide an absolute guarantee of the security of our information databases, nor do we guarantee that the information you may choose to supply will not be intercepted while you transmit it from your computer, over the internet, or along other third party networks, and to our systems. However, with respect to security: when we intend to transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server using, for example, Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer security.
We work with analytics companies to help us understand how our websites are being used, by how many users, for how long, and how frequently. Using analytics, we receive counts of the screens and features of our website that are used, the countries from which they are used, device language settings, demographics and interests information, including the types of devices, operating systems, browsers, addresses and wireless connections our users are using.
