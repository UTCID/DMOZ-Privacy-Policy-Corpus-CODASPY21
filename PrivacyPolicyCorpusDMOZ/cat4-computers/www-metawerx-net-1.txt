Privacy and Security Statement
Metawerx Pty Ltd recognises that your privacy is very important to you. Providing your personal information is an act of trust that we take very seriously. Metawerx Pty Ltd will not sell, trade, give or rent any information obtained from you to any third parties.
We acknowledge that we will collect and store information about you as part of offering and providing services to you. In this regard, we will act ethically and as evidence of this commitment, we will take reasonable steps to comply with the following principles in relation to the information you provide to us about you.
Metawerx Pty Ltd may from time to time amend, update, or change this Statement. You should check this page periodically for changes to this Privacy Statement.
Collection
Metawerx Pty Ltd collects the personal data that you volunteer on registration for any of the services or products on our website, via email, or through other forms.
This information will only be collected by lawful and fair means.
In order to register with the Metawerx Website we require some basic information about you. We also allow you to provide additional non-required information on registration and at other times. Only information marked, as "required" during registration is needed to use our services. This information is used for identification purposes, billing purposes and to contact you when necessary.
As you browse the Metawerx Website we may log the IP address of your computer, session details, and domain name to evaluate which parts of the Website you visit and how long you stay there. This tracking does not link your computer's IP address with any other information you have submitted to us. While a Metawerx user's session may be tracked, all users remain anonymous when tracked.
IP tracking information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors to measure number of visits, average time spent on the Website, pages viewed, and to help diagnose problems with our server.
Use and disclosure
Metawerx Pty Ltd requires you to provide certain information about yourself in order to provide services to you. We will not rent, sell or exchange information about you to third parties (other than related parties) except where you consent, or except where you would expect the information to be disclosed, or except where we have indicated we may disclose, or except where we are legally obliged to disclose such information.
Data quality
Metawerx Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to ensure that information we have about you is accurate, complete and up to date when we collect and use it.
Data security

Metawerx Pty Ltd will limit access to your personal information to employees and data processors that need it to carry out the service provided by us except where we inform you otherwise. Our employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of clients' and website visitors' personal data. Metawerx Pty Ltd will reinforce with other employees the policies and practices in relation to safeguarding personal information of clients and visitors, preventing its unauthorised access, use or disclosure, and ensuring its proper handling.
Our website has policies, rules and measures in place to protect the visitor's personal data from:
Unauthorised access;
Improper use;

Unlawful or accidental destruction; and
Accidental loss.

Where you have not authorised us to automatically debit your card, card information is retained until processing of your payment is complete, and then erased from our internal systems.
Our employees may access such information from our payment processor (National Australia Bank) only when there is an appropriate business reason to do so, such as when a refund must be issued back to the credit card.
