No part of this website may be copied, mirrored, republished, distributed, or reproduced in any form whatsoever without prior written permission from the site owners.
We acknowledge that in order for us to provide product reviews, on rare occasions content from organisations with which we are affiliated may have been used on this site – it is not our intention to infringe any copyright or trademarks. Logos may be trademarks of other organisations and are acknowledged. In the event that any organisation or individual feels that material used on this site has been used incorrectly or inappropriately on this site, please contact the site’s webmaster and prompt action will be taken.
Products, services & offers
This site provides information on a wide range of products and services from a selection of companies. Price, specification and offers relating to products and services promoted are
subject to change / withdrawal by these companies at any time, and any purchases made are subject to the terms and conditions of the organisation in question. When placing a purchase as a result of a visit to this or an affiliated site, visitors should always check the official website of the retailer / service provider for full information on price, specification, terms and offers prior to purchase of a product or service.
Visitor messages
Visitors to our site are able to post messages via dedicated ‘comments’ pages or in our site
forum. Visitors who post messages must not post any material which is false, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person’s privacy, or otherwise in violation of ANY law. Legal actions can be taken against posters. Visitors must not post any copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by them or they have written consent from the owner of the
copyrighted material. The site owners reserve the right to edit or delete inappropriate content without prior notice.
Posters remain solely responsible for the content of their messages. The site owners reserve the right to reveal the identity and IP addresses of any poster in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any content posted.
It is impossible for us to confirm the validity of content submitted by visitors to this site. We do not actively monitor posted messages and are not responsible for their content.
We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information
presented. The messages express the views of the author, not necessarily
the views of the site owners/administrators.
Anyone who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to notify the webmaster immediately.
We have the right to remove objectionable content within a reasonable time frame, where we deem that removal is necessary. This is a manual process, however, so please realise that we may not be able to remove or edit particular messages immediately.
We reserve the right to quote and/or re-publish posts made in our forum or our blog. Please see our site’s Privacy Policy regarding messages posted to this site.
Site advertising
As with many sites, we promote a number of selected advertisers using a partner affiliate scheme. This means that, in some cases, a small percentage of any purchases made by our visitors in response to on-site advertising may be apportioned
to the site owners to support ongoing site costs. Adverts on this website may take the form of banner adverts, adverts served from a ‘network’ (such as Google Adsense), text-based affiliate links, or contextual affiliate links.
Where possible, it is our policy to promote products and services only where a member of the FileSaveAs team has experience of using them, but the nature of contextual advertising means that this is not always possible.
If you are looking to advertise on this site, note that we will consider advertising requests from companies that are affiliated with one of a number of affiliate networks. Note that our audience is predominantly UK-based.
