Account Management
Q.
I forgot my MailMoat Username, Password or Both!
A.
Follow the "I Forgot My Password" link on the Member Login page.
On the next page, you will be asked for your MailMoat Username and Primary Email Address.
1) If you forgot your Password, enter your Username and Primary Email Address, then press the [Send Me My Info] button.
A new password will be emailed to you.
2) If you forgot your Username (or both), just enter your Primary Email Address and press the [Send Me My Info] button.
A new Username will be emailed to you.
Go back to the "I Forgot My Password" page and enter your new Username along with your Primary Email Address.
Then a new Password will also be emailed to you.
(This extra step is to prevent other people from using these features to change your password)
(If your Primary Email Address is no longer current, you must contact Customer Service by email at support@mailmoat.com or by phone at (734) 997-7000, M-F 9:30am - 4:00pm EST)
Q.
I keep getting logged out of MailMoat's Members Area.

General
Q.
Can I get a regular e-mail account on MailMoat?
A.
Not yet.
This is something that we plan to do in the future, but it will take a while.
There are lots of useful and just-plain-cool things that would be easy to do with a combined MailMoat & regular e-mail account, but it'll take a lot more programming, disk space for mailboxes, and bandwidth to do.
(The first reason for the "free email accounts" folks to sell you to half the world's slimy advertisers is to pay the bills!)
Q.
Can't MailMoat aliases be guessed with a computer?
A.
It's somewhat like guessing winning lottery numbers with a computer.
A default-strength MailMoat alias is 8 letters - there are 208,827,064,576 possibilities.
A junk mail pusher can't learn anything about which MailMoat user might have what active aliases - he's just making random guesses, trying to get lucky and "hit" an alias that's active right now.
MailMoat's computers notice after a few wrong guesses, and start responding slower and slower....and.......slower to the spammer's guesses.
If this doesn't sound tough enough, MailMoat offers stronger
aliases - all the way up to 16 letters & numbers, for 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 possibilities.
Q.
How does MailMoat work?
A.
See the How MailMoat.com Works page for more information.
Q.
What features does mailmoat offer?
A.
See the MailMoat Features and Rates page for more information.
Q.
Why is junk email called SPAM?
Doesn't Hormel Foods get angry about its trademark being used this way?
A.
Hormel Foods would be happier if everyone called junk email "UCE" (for Unsolicited Commercial Email), but is quite reasonable about the
words "spam", "spammer", "spamming", etc.
(The SPAM on your grocer's shelves is spelled with all capital letters; Hormel wants folks to use lower case letters for the bad kind.)

Q.
Why should I pay for MailMoat.com's services?
A.
For more information, visit our Why should I choose MailMoat.com page.
Q.
Will MailMoat ever send me unsolicited email?
A.
MailMoat.com will never send you SPAM.
Occasionally, we may send you email to notify you of a problem with your account, or of important changes to MailMoat.
For more information, see the MailMoat Privacy Statement.
Q.
Will MailMoat work with my computer?
A.
MailMoat runs on our servers, not on your computer.
The email part works with all standard internet email.
Our web site works with virtually any web browser that allows temporary cookies (to remember that you're logged in).
Your browser will need SSL security if you're sending us your credit card number or using PayPal.
(No SSL is needed if you fax us your credit card number.)
Message Information
Q.
What happens when a message is sent to an expired MailMoat alias?
A.
Before MailMoat accepts even part of a message, the alias is checked to verify that it is current.
If the alias has expired, then MailMoat will reject the message.
If the alias is current, then MailMoat will initiate delivery.
Before MailMoat accepts the delivered message, the alias is verified once again.
If the alias is expired at that point, MailMoat will return an error message to the sending server, and not accept the message for delivery.
MailMoat never keeps copies of failed messages.
My Privacy
Q.
Do you keep my credit card number on file?
A.
If your bank refused to let us charge your credit card (for any reason), we may keep your number on file.
If we do, we will use a secure one-way encryption method to store this number. (The exact details on our method is obviously confidential).
If your bank honors your credit card, then we are required by our merchant agreement to keep your credit card information on file for cargeback and for fraud control.
We will store your information in a very strong encrypted mannor and it will not be stored on a server that is directly connected to the internet and only accpets information from our server and will never send any data out.
(The exact details of the encryption and setup are obviously confidential).
In the future, we may offer a service to automatically re-bill your credit card when your account expires, if we do this, you will have to specify that you wish for this to happen.
Q.
What could someone learn by analyzing my MailMoat alias?
A.
Anyone can see whether an alias is default strength (8 letters, "only" 208+ BILLION possible aliases) or one of the higher strengths that MailMoat offers.
If you gave the same alias to several different people (or companies) and they bothered to compare notes, they could learn that they were all dealing with the same person.
Other than that, NOTHING.
MailMoat aliases are encrypted random numbers with NO data about you or your other aliases.
Only the carefully-secured MailMoat alias database can tell that your aliases are connected to you.
Q.
Your Privacy Policy is too long and complicated. Can you summarize it?
A.
Sure!
We collect & keep four types of information from & about you:
A) Payment related information: Credit card #, Name, Billing address, payment amounts & dates, etc.
B) Information needed for MailMoat to work: Your username, One-Way Encrypted password, real e-mail addresses, MailMoat aliases, etc.
C) Misc. Personal Information: E-mails to our support department, etc.
D) Semi-Anonymous Information: Suggestion Box ideas from you, size of e-mail messages passing through the system, etc.
We have to send the "A" information out to the bank to charge your credit card (if you pay by credit card).
We also keep this information as secret as possible.
The "B" information has to be on the MailMoat servers for your account to function.
"C" & "D" information is used to help make MailMoat a better place.
