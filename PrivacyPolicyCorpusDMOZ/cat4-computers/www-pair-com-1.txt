Growing Ecommerce Websites and Developers When you choose virtual private server (VPS) hosting, your website is on a shared server, but with the benefits of dedicated hosting. Your account is partitioned off from the other users sharing the server so, there’s no overlap of resources. This allows you to have more flexibility to customize your server software. We recommend VPS hosting for users with resource-intensive websites that require more customization like ecommerce sites.
