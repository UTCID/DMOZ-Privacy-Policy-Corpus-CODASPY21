This Agreement contains the terms on which we will permit you to do that. Where we write “us”, “we” or “our”, we mean Octeth, Inc., the corporation that provides email marketing solutions under the Octeth and Oempro brands. Where we write “you” or “your”, we mean the individual developer and the developer’s employer. The person who accepts this agreement is deemed to bind his or her employer to these terms.IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR EMPLOYER, THEN WE DO NOT LICENSE YOU TO USE THE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, PLUGIN ENGINE OR API. If you proceed to use the Development Tools, Plugin Engine or to access our API, you will be deemed to have accepted and agreed with all of the following terms. If you cannot accept that we may terminate your use and anybody’s use of your Plugin in our discretion, then you should not begin.1. DEFINITIONS“API” means an Application Program Interface provided by us, that is a set of routines, data structures, object classes or protocols. There may be more than one, and in this Agreement the term is both singular and plural.“Application” means the software application, website or other interface that you develop, own or operate to interact with the API.“Customer” means a person visiting a Store, regardless of whether there is an e-commerce transaction.“Development Tools” means the software code and information made available to you from Shopify.com and perhaps from other sites controlled by us.“Merchant” means a person (individual or corporate) operating a Store.“Personal Information” means any information pertaining to a directly or indirectly identifiable individual.“Store” means an on-line presence for e-commerce, hosted by us.2. DEVELOPERS PROGRAM CONDITIONSParticipation in the Developers Program. The Shopify Developers Program consists of access to the Shopify API and our suite of open source Development Tools that facilitate the creation of Applications to access and interact with our Stores and services. Any Application will be installed and run on your server, or a Merchant’s server, but not our server. Access to any Store must be granted by the Store’s Merchant through a consent screen that we provide.Permitted Uses. Your use of the Shopify Development Tools and API is permitted only for the purpose of developing Applications that facilitate your own, or a Merchant’s, or a Customer’s, use of Shopify Stores and services. Examples of permitted Applications (although the list is almost endless) are Applications that:enhance the look and feel of a Storeprovide Merchants with order processing assistanceprovide Merchants with information about Customers and about products in their Storetrack orders for Merchants or for Customerstranslate languages for Merchants or for Customersassist Merchants to manage inventoryattract Customers to a Storepromote a Store to past Customersif expressly authorized by us in writing, perform or enable multi-store research, which would be limited to anonymized historical dataUn-Permitted Uses. Your access to the API is as our guest, under a free, revocable, licence. We reserve the right to terminate your access for situations that we consider undesirable, in our own judgment. We cannot imagine now every situation that would be undesirable, but to give a few examples, this would include, without limitation:Applications that damage our software, or allow malware to affect software or the MerchantsApplications that distribute spyware, adware, or programs commonly found objectionableApplications that excessively burden our system, which we might either terminate or throttleApplications that fail to respect, or to adequately protect, the privacy of CustomersApplications that weaken the security of credit card or payment information of CustomersApplications that are a checkout or a payment system (we have selected providers for those)Use of Store data to generate unsolicited email from anyone other than that Store’s MerchantDisclosure of Store data to anyone other than the Merchant, without the Merchant’s consentAttempts to reverse engineer Shopify software that is not open sourceApplications that allegedly violate the intellectual property rights of any person (if we consider the allegation reasonable, without the results of litigation) **Violations of the law in any country by use of the Application, or facilitated by the ApplicationTermination of Your Access and Application. We can terminate or restrict the use of your Application through our API at any time for our convenience. Without limiting that very general statement, we would terminate your rights under this Agreement if you breach this Agreement, or if you support or condone un-permitted uses such as are mentioned in the preceding paragraph, or if we feel you are defrauding Merchants by not delivering on your promises to them. Before we do that, we will notify you of our concern, if you can conveniently be contacted by email, and we will then allow some time (how long depends on the nature of the problem) for you to eliminate the problem. We may temporarily suspend the Application if that seems to us to be necessary for protection of the Merchants or us. Termination will adversely affect the Merchants who use your Application, and therefore you must ensure that all Merchants who adopt your Application are aware of that risk.Who is Responsible. You must inform all Merchants who adopt your Application, in your sales literature or sales contracts:that you are entirely responsible for the Application;that we at Shopify.com are not liable for any fault in the Application, or harm done by it;that we at Shopify.com cannot provide assistance with installation or use of the Application.Our Licence to You. Access to our API is licensed to you on a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable basis, on the terms and conditions set forth herein. You shall not transfer or sub-license any rights granted by this Agreement, except as necessary for Merchants and Customers to use your Applications. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by us. This Agreement applies to all updates, substitutions, revisions, and copies of the API, whether made by us or for us or by or for you.Application Development. You may develop, display and distribute Applications that interact with our API. You may use any Development Tool that we provide on our website explicitly as a Development Tool for the purpose of developing Applications. You may make derivative works based on any Development Tool. You may not use anything we provide for any purpose not related to our Stores.Data Retention. You may make intermediate copies of the contents of Stores only as necessary to perform an activity permitted under this Agreement, and within limits set by Merchant. You must delete all copies of such Store contents when they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were created.Trademarks. We license you on a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable basis to display certain logos and trademarks that we provide explicitly for such use as part of the Development Tools, but only for use in your Applications or for the marketing of your Applications, and only in relation to us at Shopify.com or in relation to a Store. We reserve the right to require you to stop using our logos or trademarks in some manner that we do not like, in our sole discretion.Service Providers. You may work with service providers as necessary to facilitate your performance under this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any act or omission by your service provider amounting to a breach of this Agreement will be deemed a breach by you.Industry Standards. Your networks, operating system and software of its web servers, routers, databases, and computer systems (collectively, your “System”) must be properly configured to Internet industry standards so as to securely operate your Application. If you do not completely control some aspect of the System you will use all influence that you have over the System to do so. You must diligently correct any security deficiency, and disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder.Collecting and Using Personal Information. Customers disclose Personal Information to the Merchant, but they do not intend it to be accessible to you. Your Application must not make Personal Information accessible to you or anyone but the Merchant unless the Customer is clearly notified, before the Customer discloses the Personal Information, about who will also receive the Personal Information. An exception to that prohibition on access are automatic bug reports that are occasionally generated automatically to report a problem and may contain Personal Information. You must not retain that information longer than reasonably necessary to diagnose and correct a software problem, and must not use the information for any other purpose and must not disclose it beyond the technical staff working on the software problem. Your Application must assist Merchants to comply with rules about privacy of Personal Information, such as by ensuring that it is deleted when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. At all times, your Application and your use of the data from Stores must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and best practices concerning privacy, Personal Information, and data protection.Communication. You must not use Personal Information from Merchants or Customers to enable sending of unsolicited communications of any type. You may communicate with Merchants, or with Customers but only on behalf of Merchants. You may send communications to recipients who have explicitly consented to receive them.Competitive or Similar Materials. We are not precluded from discussing, reviewing, developing for ourself, having developed, acquiring, licensing, or developing for third parties, as well as marketing and distributing, materials which are competitive with your Application or other products or services provided by you, regardless of their similarity to your current products or products that you may develop.3. MODIFICATIONSModification of the API and Stores. We may modify the Development Tools, the API, permitted API calls, databases, the permitted uses under this Agreement, and any Store. Merchants may also modify their Stores. Merchants may deny API access to their Stores. Modifications may affect your Application and may require you to make changes to your Application at your own cost to continue to be compatible with, or interface with, the API or our Stores and services. That is a risk you must accept.Modification of this Agreement. We may from time to time change the terms of this Agreement. We will post the amended terms on Shopify.com and we may also send you a notice about the amended terms by email. Except where stated otherwise herein, all amended terms will be effective thirty days after they are posted or emailed to you. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT BY SENDING A TERMINATION NOTICE TO US AT SHOPIFY.COM.

You must not try to block or otherwise interfere with the monitoring or audit, and we may use technical means to overcome any methods you may use to block or interfere with such monitoring. Audits may include requests for documents and for information and for a visit to your facilities. Your failure to reasonably comply with our audit shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.Remedy for Breach. If we, in our sole discretion, believe that you or your service providers have breached this Agreement, or that you or your service providers have engaged in fraudulent activity, we may take any and all steps we consider appropriate, including warning, investigating, or terminating or suspending your rights under this Agreement.Corrective Action. In addition to any other available remedies, we may, in our sole discretion, seek specific performance, an injunction, and legal costs. We reserve the right to take corrective action as we see fit if we receive complaints from Merchants or Customers about your Application or your actions.5. NO FEESAccess. We charge no fee for access to our API and Development Tools, but we reserve the right to introduce fees in the future for things that we have not already provided to you.Directory. For no fee, we will advertise your Application in a directory on our website, if your Application meets our criteria which are entirely in our discretion, in a manner that enables existing and potential Merchants to contact you.Merchant. You and a Merchant may agree on any fee for use of your Application. It may be a one-time fee, or a periodic fee, or a component of prices paid by each Customer.Revenue Sharing.
