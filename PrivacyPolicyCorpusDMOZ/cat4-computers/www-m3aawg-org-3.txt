M3AAWG Engagement Series: U.S. Data Security and Privacy Regulation
Submitted by M3AAWG Content Manager on Aug 27, 2020Author: Amy Cadagin, Executive Director of M3AAWG
In the latest installment in our Member Engagement Series, Dennis Dayman, Program and Growth & Development Chairperson and Elections Co-Chair at M3AAWG, will host a session on the state of U.S. data privacy regulations in relation to international standards on Tuesday, September 1st at 8am PT / 11am ET. Professionals from M3AAWG member companies are welcome to join the session to learn more on the latest developments. To register for the webinar, please visit the M3AAWG Engagement Series site.
In July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated Privacy Shield – a cooperative framework which allowed data to be transferred and processed between the E.U. and U.S. – which has reduced the capacity for personal data sharing between the two regions. The move greatly restricts the ability of law enforcement agencies, regulators and agencies in both the E.U. and U.S. to collaborate.
The E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) limits the sharing of personal data to third party countries, and prior to the decision from the ECJ, the Privacy Shield framework and well as its predecessor, the Safe Harbor Decision, provided exemption for data sharing with the U.S.. The ECJ’s decision highlights the division between the E.U. and the U.S. when it comes to consumers privacy standards – while GDPR mandates and enforces consumer privacy for the entirety of the E.U., the U.S. currently has no federal standard comprehensively governing the collection, use, and dissemination of consumers’ information. In the wake of the ECJ’s decision, it’s clear that the U.S. must move beyond sectorial and state laws to develop a fundamental privacy standard that allows it to maintain robust data sharing relationships with its international partners.
GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have reignited the debate over the need for strong consumer privacy laws. “It’s time!" many people are saying for a comprehensive U.S. federal law, but many states aren’t waiting and taking the issue into their own hands – profoundly impacting the way that digital marketers operate, and the time they have to modify data storage practices and process regulations. In his presentation, Dayman will discuss how this has impacted the U.S. viewpoints on privacy, how outside regulations are impacting privacy standards in the U.S. today, and how the U.S. needs to develop a federal standard – rooted in transparency and consent – that ensures consumer control over personal data.
The presentation is open to all M3AAWG member companies and their team members. Please keep in mind that all M3AAWG Member Engagement sessions follow M3AAWG meeting and conduct policy. We look forward to having you in attendance and ask that you register ahead of the session on the M3AAWG Engagement Series site.
