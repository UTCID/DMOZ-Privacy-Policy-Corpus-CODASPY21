Availability
DropShots uses reasonable endeavors to ensure that the Service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Service will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and emergency repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of DropShots.

Definition

The term unused is defined as: no new pictures or videos being uploaded to the user's account for the specified period.
DropShots Elected Termination - Although it is not planned or anticipated, there may become a reason or need for DropShots to terminate its service to lifetime account members in the future.

DropShots Is Closing Down
Dear DropShots Customer,
We regret to inform you that we have decided to close down DropShots.com.
Our last day of business will be on September 15, 2020. After that date,
DropShots will no longer be available and all user content will be
securely deleted. If you'd like to keep your content, please log in to
your account and download your photos and videos before that date.
The decision to close down DropShots was not an easy one and we enjoyed
the relationships with our customers over the years. Thank you for being
with us, we'll miss you!
Sincerely,
The DropShots Team
**Notice: One of our servers is still not working.**
We're sorry, we are still having an issue with one of our storage servers.
