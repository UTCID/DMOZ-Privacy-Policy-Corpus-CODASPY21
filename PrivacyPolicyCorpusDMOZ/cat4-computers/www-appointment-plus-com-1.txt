AppointmentPlus strongly recommends a minimum screen resolution of 1024 x 768 for the best possible user experience. Screen resolutions smaller than 1024 x 768 may cause display issues.
Provided that you are not under the age of 18 years old, AppointmentPlus grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable worldwide right to use the Services, subject to these Terms of Use (the “License”). You grant to AppointmentPlus the non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, copy, store, transmit, and display Your Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services. You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or commercially exploit for any purposes, any portion of, use of, or access to the Services. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by AppointmentPlus and its licensors. In the unlikely event you fail to comply with these Terms of Use, we may terminate the License without notice and You will no longer be permitted to access or use the Services. For the purposes hereof, “Your Data” means any data, information, or material provided or submitted by your users, and any registration information and appointment data provided or submitted by your customers, or by your users on behalf of your customers, to your Scheduler in the course of using the Services.

If we become aware of possible violations of these Terms of Use, we may initiate an investigation that may include gathering information from you or any user involved and the examination of other material. We may suspend the provision of our Services temporarily, or we may permanently remove the material involved from our servers, provide warnings to you, or suspend or terminate your access to the Services. We will determine what action will be taken in response to a violation at our sole discretion. We will fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected violations of law.
From time to time, AppointmentPlus or third parties may make certain third-party applications, integrations, implementation, customization or consulting services, and other products and services (collectively, the “Third-Party Applications”) available to you. Any acquisition or usage of a Third-Party Application, and any exchange of data between you and any Third-Party Application provider, is solely between you and such third party. AppointmentPlus does not guarantee, warrant, or support any Third-Party Application, whether or not such Third-Party Applications are designated as “certified” by AppointmentPlus. If any such Third-Party Application provider ceases to make its Third-Party Application available for interoperation with the Services on terms acceptable to AppointmentPlus, we, in our sole discretion, may cease permitting such interoperability with no liability to you for any refund, credit, or other compensation. If you access, install, or enable any Third-Party Application, you acknowledge and agree that AppointmentPlus may permit such Third-Party Application providers to access Your Data as required for the interoperation of such Third-Party Applications with the Services. You acknowledge and agree that AppointmentPlus is not liable for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of Your Data resulting from any such access by Third-Party Application providers. You acknowledge and agree to always backup Your Data prior to syncing or integrating.
We value your privacy and understand your privacy concerns. Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your access to and use of the Services, so that you may understand our privacy practices. All information we collect is subject to our Privacy Policy, and by accessing and using the Services you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy. You further understand that any information collected by AppointmentPlus may be transferred to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use by AppointmentPlus and its affiliates.
From time to time, AppointmentPlus may invite you to try, free of charge, certain AppointmentPlus products or services that are not generally available to our customers (“Non-GA Services”). You may accept or decline any such trial in your sole discretion and at your sole risk. Any Non-GA Services will be clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, nonproduction, or similar designation. Non-GA Services are provided solely for evaluation purposes and are not intended for and should not be used for production use. Non-GA Services are not supported, may contain bugs or errors, and may be subject to additional terms. AppointmentPlus may discontinue Non-GA Services at any time, in our sole discretion, and may determine to never make them generally available. NON-GA SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED “SERVICES” HEREUNDER AND ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE NON-GA SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THE SERVICE OR SERVERS THAT MAKE THE NON-GA SERVICES AVAILABLE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE NON-GA SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.

You further agree that AppointmentPlus may provide any and all notices, statements, and other communications to you through email to the email address provided in the Registration Data. In connection with the Registration Data, you will select a login name and login password. Although we will use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to you the login name and login password, we reserve the right to reject any of your selections, including if such information has been previously assigned to another user, or if we, in our sole discretion, deem such data or information to be offensive or unprofessional.
You may designate and add users and shall provide and assign unique passwords and user names to each authorized user. You shall ensure that multiple users do not share a password or user name. You acknowledge and agree that you are prohibited from sharing passwords and/or user names with unauthorized users. You will be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your passwords and user names. You are responsible for managing users and their user names, and user access to the Services (e.g., shutting down access for users terminated by you). AppointmentPlus will act as though any electronic communications it receives under Your passwords, user names, and/or account numbers have been sent by You. You agree to immediately notify AppointmentPlus if you become aware of any loss or theft or unauthorized use of any of your passwords and/or user names.
We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

You will provide AppointmentPlus or our designated payment processing vendor with valid and updated credit card information, or with an Order Form or alternative document acceptable to AppointmentPlus. If we utilize a third-party payment processing vendor, then additional terms and conditions will apply to your transactions with such vendor. If you provide credit card information, you authorize AppointmentPlus to charge such credit card for the License, including for the Initial Term(s) and any Renewal Term(s) as set forth in Section 6. You agree, understand, and confirm that the payment information provided by you will be correct and accurate, and that you are using a form of payment that you are legally authorized to use for this purpose. You agree that you are liable for any payment or credit card fraud, abuse, or unauthorized use by you or others.
You shall pay all personal property, sales, use, value-added, withholding, and similar taxes (other than taxes on our net income) arising from the transactions described in these Terms of Use, even if such amounts are not identified herein. To the extent you are exempt from sales or other taxes, you agree to provide AppointmentPlus, upon request, with the appropriate exemption certificate.
AppointmentPlus reserves the right to change the Fee for any Renewal Term with at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice to you, which notice may be provided by email.
All Fees are due and payable as set forth herein and in the applicable Order Form. If you believe any Fees are incorrect, you must contact us within ten (10) days of the date of payment to be eligible to receive an adjustment or credit.
Term and Termination.
If you register on our website for a free trial, we will make all or part of the Services available to you on a trial basis, free of charge (the “Free Trial”). The Free Trial will commence upon AppointmentPlus permitting you to access and use the Services, and will expire upon the earlier of (i) the end of the Free Trial time period for which you registered to use the applicable Services, or (ii) the commencement of your use of the Services on a non-trial basis for payment (the “Free Trial Period”). These Terms of Use will apply to you and the Services during the Free Trial Period.
The initial term for your access to and use of the Services shall commence upon the date you accept these Terms of Use in connection with creating your non-Free Trial account and shall continue for the time period set forth in your Order Form (the “Initial Term”). Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, these Terms of Use shall automatically renew for successive Renewal Terms of equal length as the Initial Term (each a “Renewal Term”) unless (i) AppointmentPlus has terminated your License prior to the commencement of such Renewal Term, (ii) AppointmentPlus terminates your License upon the expiration of the Initial Term, or (iii) prior to the expiration of your License, you notify AppointmentPlus that you do not intend to renew your License.
AppointmentPlus reserves the right to deny your access to or use of all or part of the Services, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you are engaging or have engaged in any conduct or activity that we believe, in our sole discretion, is unprofessional; obscene; violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations; or violates these Terms of Use. You acknowledge and agree that AppointmentPlus may terminate these Terms of Use pursuant to the terms hereof, and, in connection with such termination, (i) no prior notice is required, and (ii) AppointmentPlus may immediately deactivate or delete your account(s) and all related information and files, including Your Data, in your account(s), and/or prohibit any further access to such data or files or the Services. You acknowledge and agree that AppointmentPlus will not be liable to you or any third party in connection with any termination of your access to or use of the Services pursuant to the terms hereof.
The Services may be cancelled at any time. The effectiveness of any cancellation will not occur until the end of the thirtieth (30th) day after your completion of the appropriate cancellation form provided by AppointmentPlus upon your request (a “Cancellation Form”). No full or partial refunds or prorations will be provided, regardless of your usage of the Services and regardless of whether the Fee is paid in full in advance or monthly during the Initial Term or Renewal Term. In addition to the Cancellation Form, all cancellation requests also require live telephone confirmation with an AppointmentPlus Client Success representative (including account ownership verification and reason for cancellation). Cancellation requests will not be processed until such live telephone confirmation is completed.
Disclaimer of Warranties/Limitation of Liability.
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPOINTMENTPLUS AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THE SERVICE OR SERVERS THAT MAKE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.
YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IF YOU DOWNLOAD ANY CONTENT OR DATA FROM THE SERVICES, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOADING OF ANY CONTENT OR DATA THROUGH THE SERVICES. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RESTRICT OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OR ANY FEATURE OR PART THEREOF AT ANY TIME. THE APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DELETION OR MIS-DELIVERY OF, OR FAILURE TO STORE, ANY CONTENT, DATA, OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS.
WE PROVIDE YOU THE ABILITY TO, AND WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU, REGULARLY BACK UP ALL DATA VIA REPORTS AND MICROSOFT EXCEL® FILES TO PRESERVE YOUR DATA.
THE SERVICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. APPOINTMENTPLUS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR OTHER DAMAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH PROBLEMS.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF AN APPOINTMENTPLUS PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR USE OR ACCESS OF, OR INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS, THE SERVICES; (ii) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; OR (iv) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR SCHEDULER.
IN NO EVENT SHALL APPOINTMENTPLUS’ TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY (AND NOT OTHERWISE REFUNDED TO) YOU TO APPOINTMENTPLUS FOR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES. THIS AGREEMENT ALLOCATES RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE PRICING SET FORTH IN EACH ORDER DOCUMENT REFLECTS THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SPECIFIED HEREIN.
Indemnification and Release.
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the AppointmentPlus Parties for, from, and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to any violation of these Terms of Use by you or any other actions connected with your use of the Services. Your indemnification obligations include, without limitation, claims arising out of any of Your Data, as well as any claims arising out of acts or omissions by your employees or agents, and any other person or entity who gains access to the Services through your user names or passwords, either with your permission or as a result of your failure to use reasonable security measures.
AppointmentPlus will indemnify you for, from, and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to a claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought by any third party against you alleging that the use of the Services as permitted hereunder infringes any United States patent, copyright, or trademark, or constitutes a misappropriation of a trade secret of a third party. The foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent the claim arises out of or relates to (a) any use of the Services in a manner other than as specified in these Terms of Use; (b) any use of the Services in combination with other products, equipment, devices, software, systems, or data not supplied by AppointmentPlus to the extent such claim is caused by such combination; or (c) any alteration, modification, or customization of the Services or any software made by any party other than AppointmentPlus or AppointmentPlus’ authorized representatives if such infringement would not have occurred without such alteration, modification, or customization. You will (i) promptly notify AppointmentPlus in writing of any claim, suit, or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed, provided that failure to so notify will not remove AppointmentPlus’ obligation except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby, and (ii) allow AppointmentPlus to solely control the defense of any claim, suit, or proceeding and all negotiations for settlement; provided, however, that AppointmentPlus may not settle or compromise any such claim without your prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, unless such settlement or compromise (1) includes an unconditional release of you from all liability arising out of such claim, or (2) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of you. You will also provide AppointmentPlus with reasonable cooperation and assistance in defending such claim (at our cost).
Other than as set forth herein, AppointmentPlus is not directly involved in the actual transaction between you and your customers using the Services (including your Scheduler). AppointmentPlus has no control over the quality or legality of the appointments made, or the truth or accuracy of the user registrations. AppointmentPlus cannot ensure that your customers will honor their appointments. As we are not involved in the actual direct transaction between you and your customer, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more customers, you release the AppointmentPlus Parties from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive any and all rights and benefits conferred by the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, which provides as follows:
A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
Injunctive Relief.
Your breach of these Terms of Use may result in immediate and irreparable harm to us, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and, therefore, you agree that we are entitled to equitable relief to compel you to cease and desist all unauthorized use, evaluation, and disclosure of information obtained through the Services, which is in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.
Governing Law.
These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona and controlling U.S. federal law. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, and choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will not apply to these Terms of Use. Any legal action or proceeding relating to these Terms of Use shall be instituted in a state or federal court in Maricopa County, Arizona, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any defense relating to venue or forum non convenience.
Legal Compliance.
You represent and warrant that you are not (a) located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
You have not received nor have you been offered any illegal or improper bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any employee or agents of AppointmentPlus in connection with these Terms of Use. Reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business do not violate the above restriction.
You shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations regarding your use of the Services, and posting and retrieval of Your Data (including, without limitation, those governing interstate commerce, export control, unfair competition, or false advertising). If there are applicable fees and taxes you incur to access the Services, including, without limitation, all applicable sales, use, gross receipts, and excise taxes, you are solely responsible for their payment.
No Waiver; Severability.
A waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms of Use is not a waiver of any repetition of such breach and will not in any manner affect any other terms or conditions of these Terms of Use. We do not waive any rights by the failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use in every instance in which it might apply. In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that is the closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
Assignability.
We may assign our rights and delegate our duties under these Terms of Use, either in whole or in part, at any time without notice. You may not assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer your rights or obligations, in whole or in part, under these Terms of Use to anyone else without our prior written consent.
Relationship.
This Agreement does not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between you and us.
Notice.
AppointmentPlus may give notice by means of a general notice on the Services, electronic mail to your email address on record in AppointmentPlus’ account information, or by written communication sent by first-class mail or prepaid post to your address on record in AppointmentPlus’ account information. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after mailing or posting (if sent by first-class mail or prepaid post) or 12 hours after sending (if sent by email). You may give notice to AppointmentPlus (such notice shall be deemed given when received by AppointmentPlus) at any time by any of the following: (i) email to info@AppointmentPlus.com; (ii) letter sent by confirmed facsimile to AppointmentPlus at 480.607.4419; (iii) letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first-class postage prepaid mail to AppointmentPlus at 15300 N. 90th Street, Suite 100, Scottsdale, AZ 85260.
Integration and Modification.
These Terms of Use, together with (i) any applicable order document produced and executed by AppointmentPlus (each an “Order Form”), and (ii) any applicable Business Associate Agreement entered into and executed by the parties (a “BAA”), represents the parties’ entire understanding relating to the Services, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting, or additional communications. Nothing contained in any purchase order submitted by you other than order dates, identity, location, quantity, and price shall in any way serve to modify or add to these Terms of Use or an Order Form. In the case of a conflict between these Terms of Use, the Order Form, or a BAA, unless expressly stated otherwise in the document that it shall control over all other documents, the order of precedence shall be: (1) these Terms of Use, (2) the BAA, and (3) the Order Form.
