What is privacy?
Personal data are any information related to an identified or identifiable person. This covers a wide range, including name, address, location, IP address, and cookies.
GDPR impacts websites even if the operating organization has no physical presence in Europe and doesn’t target European customers.
Organizations collecting or processing personal data of EU citizens must comply with GDPR.
What is the potential impact of getting GDPR wrong?
Organizations found to violate GDPR are at risk of a penalty of 4% of global revenue, or €20 million. Data protection authorities can also issue sanctions such as bans on data processing or public reprimands.
Silktide tracks GDPR violations and gives your team a priority list of remedial actions.
Cookie control
