Each time you provide information to Publisher on any Website page owned, operated or controlled by the Publisher, request information on any site, or submit any other form of inquiry, send us an email, subscribe to a newsletter, redeem an offer or otherwise transmit information via the site in any way, Publisher may obtain and collect personally identifiable information provided by you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, social security number, credit card information, telephone number, or any other form of data that you submit, including your user agent information, a cookie, IP address, a time-date stamp and potentially more information may be collected and recorded to a backup file for our records indefinitely.
You may also provide us with information that, when combined with personally identifiable information, provides the Publisher with a better idea of who you are, including but not limited to your gender, birthday, marital status, and education level (collectively referred to as “personal information”).

1.2. Survey Information:
Publisher collects information from you when you voluntarily complete a survey, order form, or a registration page either online by using the internet, or offline by providing this information through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This information may also be collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third-parties. This method of collection is collectively known as a survey (“Survey”). In such Surveys, the Publisher or a third-party may ask you to provide personal identifiable information Including your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (Including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time.

Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Publisher or any third-party.

When acquiring this information, Publisher seeks assurances from the third-party that it has a right to transfer the information to Publisher and that the third-party has a right to provide offers from advertisers to you included on the third-party list.
1.4. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology:
Publisher currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, Publisher may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.
(a) Cookies: Cookies are a feature of your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Publisher’s websites, you need to accept cookies.
(b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Publisher to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Publisher also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Publisher’s database.
(c) IP Addresses: Publisher automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
(d) Computer Profiles: Publisher may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Publisher may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with personal identification information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.
(e) Data Analysis: Data analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a client of Publisher.
(f) New Technology: The use of technology on the internet, Including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, Publisher strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.
1.5. No Information Collected from Children:
Publisher will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If Publisher obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, Publisher has no such information to knowingly use or to disclose to third-parties. Publisher has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
1.6. Credit Card Information:
Publisher may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information when an individual places an order from Publisher. When the credit card information is submitted to Publisher, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Publisher will use the credit card information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the credit card information will be disclosed to third-parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
2. Use of Individual Information
The following section describes how Publisher uses personal information. The uses described in these sections may change at any time. Publisher may also broaden its use of your personal information. Publisher may also use your personal information to provide commercial promotional offers to individuals or entities through, among other things, email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, banner advertising, SMS mobile and text messaging.
2.1. Discretion to Use Information:

If you wish to end your email subscription from a particular list, you only need to press the unsubscribe link on the bottom or footer of any email message sent by this Publisher. Because Publisher only sends emails when you have agreed to receive emails from Publisher or you have agreed to receive emails from third-parties, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to email messages sent by Publisher. Publisher is not responsible for any email sent by a third-party to whom it has sold, transferred or otherwise licensed email contact information. Publisher is indemnified by all third-parties who mail or email data collected by Publisher as licensing would include procedures to lawfully transfer your email information to them for CAN-SPAM compliant uses. If a third-party that is licensed to use your data for any legal reason is not in compliance, such activity is directly the responsibility of the entity mailing to your email address and should be addressed with the company or individual that owns the email address from which you received mail from.
2.3. Profiling and Target Advertising:
Publisher uses your information to make and improve profiles of you and to track your online browsing habits and determine which areas of Publisher’s websites are most frequently visited. This information helps Publisher to better understand your interests so that it can target advertising and promotions to you. Publisher may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.
2.4. Storage of Personal Information:
Publisher stores your information in a database on Publisher’s servers. Our servers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Publisher’s control.

Publisher does not control the use of such technology and Publisher has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about you.
4.2. Links:
The Websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third-parties. Publisher is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked Websites may contain links to websites maintained by third-parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. Publisher does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such third party websites.

You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages. To unsubscribe or discontinue SMS messages, send “STOP”, “END”, “QUIT” to the SMS text message you have received.
