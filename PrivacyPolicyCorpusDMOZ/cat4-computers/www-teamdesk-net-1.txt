Updated: November, 9th 2020
The privacy of your data is very important to us. This document
explains how your data is stored, where it is stored and whether it is stored
securely.

Security
Data Encryption
TeamDesk encrypts the data over the wire via 256-bit (SHA2)
TLS certificate, TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. Database is encrypted via AES256. File
attachments are also encrypted via AES256.
Data Backups and Disaster recovery
TeamDesk backs up the data on an hourly basis. Since the
data in the database is encrypted, backups are encrypted as well. Backup files
and server logs are copied to a secure disaster recovery facility where they
are kept for 6 months before being permanently deleted. TeamDesk doesn't
utilize any type of removable media for backup storage, all backup files are
stored on secure servers.
Personnel Access
A small team of operations personnel have administrative
access to the infrastructure where TeamDesk is hosted.  Additionally, TeamDesk
developers occasionally require a read-only access to the database metadata to
troubleshoot problems. TeamDesk support personnel does not have access to
customer databases unless they are invited or authorized by a customer.
All TeamDesk employees sign confidentiality agreements
before gaining access to the code and data. Everyone at TeamDesk is trained and
made aware of security concerns and best practices for their systems. Remote
access to servers is established via company VPN and limited to workers who
need access for their day to day work. All access events are logged for all
accounts by IP address.
Incident Response
Once TeamDesk becomes aware of any suspected or confirmed data breach, TeamDesk
will notify all affected customers via e-mail within 72 hours.
Privacy
Personally identifiable information
When a user registers a new account with TeamDesk, the
system asks for first and last name, e-mail address, password, locale and time
zone information. Name helps to personalize your experience. E-mail address is
used as a unique user identifier and for communication with the user. Locale
and time zone information is used by the system to present numbers and dates in
an appropriate format.
Due to various data integrity constraints user account
cannot be deleted, but it can be cleared from any personally identifiable
information upon request. Users of TeamDesk ‘Starter' or ‘Team' edition can
contact TeamDesk support via support@teamdesk.net.
TeamDesk Enterprise edition users should contact their account administrator.
Sharing personally identifiable information
We'll never pass your personal information to third parties
and we won't use your name in marketing statements without your permission
either. However, name and e-mail address may be copied into and securely stored
in other systems owned by ForeSoft – CRMdesk support portal and internal billing
system. Both systems are covered by common ForeSoft Corporation's Security and Privacy Policy.
Cookies
TeamDesk uses cookies for authentication, keeping certain user
preferences and tracking user movements around the site. No cookies, however,
contain personally identifiable information.
Law enforcement
TeamDesk won't hand your data over to law enforcement unless
requested by a court order. We will reject data requests from local and federal
law enforcement without a court order. And, unless we're legally prevented from
it, we'll always inform you when we receive such requests.
Data retention/deletion
Customers are responsible for understanding and implementing
their data retention and deletion requirements related to the data they uploaded
to TeamDesk. Customers may delete their data at any time and primary instances
of their data in production systems will be erased immediately, however, since
TeamDesk backups are kept for 6 months, it may take up to 6 months for their
data to be completely purged from TeamDesk backup systems after been deleted
from their apps.
Deleted Records
Deleted records are moved to database's Recycle Bin, kept
there for 30 days and then purged automatically. Database administrator can
purge records from Recycle Bin manually at any time.
Expired databases
A database is considered ‘expired' when either its trial
period ends, or a database subscription is cancelled. TeamDesk blocks access to
expired databases. Expired paid databases are securely kept in locked stage until
being deleted by a database owner or administrator. Expired trial databases are
deleted automatically within 90 days after expiration. Database administrators
are provided with all the means to delete a database at any time, before or after
its expiration.
Deleted Databases
Databases that are deleted by their owners or administrators will disappear
from users' reach immediately and will be physically deleted from the global
database within 30 days.
Backups
All types of data deleted from online databases (from individual
records to whole databases) will reside in system backups for 6 months. It will
not be restored back to production systems, except for in certain rare
instances such as the need to recover from a natural disaster or serious
security breach. In such cases, some of deleted data instances may be restored
from backups, but TeamDesk will immediately take all necessary steps to honor
the initial request to delete and erase the primary instance of the data again.
Miscellaneous
Business Continuity
ForeSoft generates a strong and stable revenue, it doesn't
rely on any financing and is 100% debt-free. TeamDesk commits to serve its
customers for life of databases' subscriptions and the company will never cease
the operations. Nevertheless, TeamDesk provides exporting tools to allow
customers establishing regular data backups to keep data locally.
Intellectual Property
TeamDesk customers' database structure and workflow
configuration is considered by TeamDesk as these customers' intellectual
property. TeamDesk protects customers' intellectual property and never shares
it with other customers.
