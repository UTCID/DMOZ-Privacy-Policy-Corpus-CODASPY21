Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it, and your rights pertaining to that data.

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including services provided by companies such as Freshsales (CRM), Atlassian (Issue tracking and project management), Zoom.us (voice and video conferencing). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request, order or reservation, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Whenever we send data to countries that do not enjoy the same type of protection as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we only do so if appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with the requirements of GDPR.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Platform or via any other Service; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
We may collect and store personal data on your devices using data caches and browser web storage (including HTML 5) and other technology.
How long do we keep your personal information?
We keep your personal information for as long as we need to for the purposes for which it was collected or (if longer) for any period for which we are required to keep personal information to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements.
Your rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by contacting us at privacy@gordano.com.
You can also ask us to update, correct or delete your data. If we are relying on consent, you can withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (including any direct marketing). If we are relying on legitimate interests for direct marketing, you can object to receiving such direct marketing. You may lodge a complaint with the UK supervisory body, the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (the ICO) here https://ico.org.uk/. If you have a concern or complaint about the way we handle your data, we ask that you contact us in the first instance to allow us to investigate and resolve the matter as appropriate.
Our Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services.
Access to information
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with GDPR. We maintain a formal Subject Access Request (SAR) policy to manage requests of this type. SARs are required to be submitted in writing via email (to privacy@gordano.com) or physical media (a letter â€“ to the address listed above). Upon receipt of the SAR additional information may be requested to validate the identity of the SAR requester, or to contextualise or otherwise assist with the SAR. You will not normally be charged for a SAR except in certain circumstances where the SAR is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.
Changes to this privacy policy
Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate permission is active, notified to you by email, or when you next access the Platform and Websites. The new terms will be displayed on-screen and you will be required to read and accept them to continue your use of the Websites, the Platform or the Services.
