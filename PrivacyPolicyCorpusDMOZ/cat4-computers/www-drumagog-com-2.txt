The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitration proceeding shall be carried on and heard in Chicago, Illinois using the English language and pursuant to the rules of JAMS. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. Both parties agree that the Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of the Terms of Use, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.
