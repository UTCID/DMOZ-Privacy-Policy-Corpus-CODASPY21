Guardian Digital Privacy Statement
Last updated August 2020
Introduction
Guardian Digital Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. This statement details the steps we take to protect your personal information when you visit our website, mobile applications or various other sites hosted by our service providers on our behalf (collectively the “Sites”). It describes the personal information that we collect, the purposes for which we use such information, and your choices regarding our use of it. The steps we take to protect your personal information and how you can review and correct your personal information are also covered here. By accessing our Sites, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy.
Information Collected
Information collected directly from you.
Generally, you can visit Guardian Digital Sites without entering any personal information. On certain pages, we may ask you for personal information to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested. The personal information we collect may include:
Contact details, such as your name, title, company/organization name, email address, telephone and fax numbers, and physical address;
Information about your company and job function;
Your email marketing preference;
Financial information (including credit card or account information);
Information such as your nationality and country of residence that allows us to determine your eligibility under export control regulations to receive information about certain technologies;
Information used to customize and facilitate your use of our Sites, including login and technical information;
Inquiries about and orders for our products and services;
Information that assists us in identifying the products and services that best meet your requirements;
Event registration information; and
Feedback from you about our Sites and our products and services generally.
If you make an application for a position with Guardian Digital, or if you are a current employee of Guardian Digital, we may collect the following information from you through our online portal:
Resume or CV, cover letter, previous work experience, educational background, type of employment sought, date available, employee referral, desired salary, travel preferences, information about your performance and career developments;
Identification, such as your passport number, expatriate status, government identification numbers (e.g. Social Security Number) where permitted, immigration status, nationality, and, where permitted, information concerning your heritage and ethnicity (for diversity monitoring purposes);
Bank account and payment details, compensation, and information about your health and sickness leave, work expenses, employee benefits and use of company resources, and your signature;
Photographs and personal details you provide in a profile; and
Any other information you submit to us, including any correspondences you may have with us.
You are not required to provide any of this information, but if you do not, we may not be able to provide you the requested service or complete your transaction.
Information collected automatically.
We collect information about your visit to our Sites, including what pages you view, the date and time you access the site, the number of bytes transferred, links you click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within Guardian Digital' Sites. On Sites that you enter with a user ID, we may connect this information with your identity to determine your potential interests in our products and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every Site you visit, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and capabilities and language, your operating system, and the website from which you linked to our Site.
Information from other sources
We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as where your employer supplies your contact details though our customer portal. If you make an application for employment with us or accept employment with us, we may obtain information from third parties, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recruiters, employment research firms, identity verification services, the references you provide to us, websites and other publicly accessible information on the Internet. We may also receive information you submit to us through third-party websites, including through LinkedIn, and other publicly available sources. Where permitted by local law and with your consent, we may request background or credit checks from public authorities or financial institutions to evaluate your eligibility for employment or certain Guardian Digital positions or projects, as well as your medical information if required to evaluate your eligibility for employment benefits.
Use of information
Services and transactions. We use your personal information to deliver services or carry out transactions you have requested, such as providing information on Guardian Digital products, registering purchased products, processing product orders, handling warranty claims, providing product manuals, answering customer service requests, receiving Guardian Digital purchase orders and managing supplier information, facilitating use of our Sites, and so forth. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Guardian Digital, information collected by our Sites may be combined with information we collect by other means.
Website improvement. We may use your personal information to improve our Sites and related Guardian Digital products and services, or to make our Sites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing our Sites to your particular preferences or interests.
Employment applications. We ask you for personal information in connection with a job application or inquiry, such as information about yourself, a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Guardian Digital and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future consideration unless you direct us not to do so. If you accept a position with Guardian Digital, we will retain this information as part of the employment relationship.
Employee portal.  If you are a Guardian Digital employee or contractor, we may offer portals or other pages on the Site to serve as a central resource for human resources functions and other functions related to the employment relationship. We may use your personal information to manage your rights, benefits, insurance plans, pensions, absences, compensation, training, leadership development, travel and other employment functions. We may also use your personal information, where permitted, for diversity monitoring, ethics and other compliance requirements. You may have the option to create an employee profile which is included in company directories and allows you to communicate and share information with other Guardian Digital employees and contractors.
Sharing of information
Disclosure of your personal information. Except as described below, personal information you provide to Guardian Digital through our Sites will not be shared outside of Guardian Digital and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.
Disclosure to service providers. Guardian Digital contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting Sites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our Sites. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.
Disclosure to distributors. In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute our products or services. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission to share your information with distributors for marketing purposes other than responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do so.
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfillment.
Disclosure in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Guardian Digital decides to sell, buy or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Guardian Digital practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.
Security
Guardian Digital is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited. For Sites to which you log in, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.
Your choices and rights
In some cases, you can review and correct personal information you provide through our Sites by going to the page on which you provided the information.

We may take steps to verify your identity before providing you access to your personal information. You can help us to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any change to your mailing address, phone number, or email address.
