1. General:
1.1. Clickey Corporation, Inc. (“regiSTAR.com”) provides a variety of services, including web hosting, design and development, domain registration and other related services (“Services”) to its customers (each, a “Customer”) under terms set forth in this Terms of Service Agreement (this “Agreement”). Services can be ordered via regiSTAR.com’s website located at www.regiSTAR.com, and any successor site thereto (the “Website”). This Agreement shall govern Services provided by regiSTAR.com to Customer, unless regiSTAR.com and Customer enter into a separate agreement intended to govern the provision of Services.
1.2. Customer: (a) agrees to be bound by this Agreement; (b) represents and warrants that, if Customer is an individual, Customer is 18 years old or older or, if Customer is an entity, that Customer is a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity duly formed (and incorporated if applicable) in good standing where required to do business with all legal authority and power to accept this Agreement; (c) agrees to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process, including billing and payment-related information and other account information, and agrees to maintain and update this information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete; and (d) represents and warrants that Customer has the power and authority to enter into and perform under this Agreement. If this Agreement or any future changes are unacceptable to Customer, Customer’s sole remedy is to cancel the Services by opening a Support Ticket via our website. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT COMPLETE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, ORDER SERVICES OR CONTINUE TO USE SERVICES, AS THE CASE MAY BE. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT, THEN SUCH CUSTOMER IS NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.
1.3. regiSTAR.com may periodically change, modify, or update this Agreement. Notice will be provided by posting new versions on the regiSTAR.com website, with the version dates as indicated at the top of this Agreement. In regiSTAR.com’s discretion, notice may also be provided by posting a notice in the regiSTAR.com support area, and/or by email notification made to the email indicated in Customer’s account settings. Therefore, Customer needs to ensure that contact information in Customer’s account settings is kept up to date. The changes, modifications or updates to this Agreement will become effective 30 days following the posting of the new version, or other notice that may be provided by regiSTAR.com. Continued use of the Services after such 30 day notice period will constitute Customer’s acceptance of a new version of this Agreement. Customer should refer to this Agreement regularly to remain updated as to current terms of this Agreement. Customer agrees that regiSTAR.com may send Customer service-related or other notices by e-mail rather than by postal mail.
1.4. Customer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Customer account, and to not share the account password, security question answers, or any other confidential information about Customer’s account with others.
1.5. Customer acknowledges that regiSTAR.com may require access to Customer’s servers for the performance of the Services and Customer hereby authorizes regiSTAR.com to access Customer’s servers for such purposes.
1.6. The Infringement Policy, the Privacy Policy, and policies (such as the Acceptable Use Policy) posted on the Website, and any work orders that incorporate this Agreement by reference, are collectively referred to herein as “this Agreement”.
2. Acceptable Use Policy:
regiSTAR.com provides the Services with the goal of promoting socially responsible content on the Internet. Accordingly, regiSTAR.com does not allow content that promotes intolerance of any race, religion, ethnicity, or other difference or that seeks to deny civil liberties or human rights, or advocates violence or physical harm to others. This description is not all inclusive, but serves to set the tone for regiSTAR.com’s goals. Please see our Acceptable Use Policy posted on the Website for more information. Content or websites that are not deemed consistent with regiSTAR.com’s objectives or that may result in liability or harm to regiSTAR.com, as determined in regiSTAR.com’s sole discretion, may be immediately deactivated by regiSTAR.com without notice, or liability to regiSTAR.com of any kind. regiSTAR.com will determine the method, schedule, timing and scope of any actions undertaken to enforce such restrictions. In any given case, regiSTAR.com shall not be obligated to undertake enforcement actions, if regiSTAR.com in its sole discretion determines otherwise.
3. Fees and Billing:
3.1. Customer agrees to pay for the Services that Customer orders. The fees may include setup fees, monthly fees, quarterly fees, annual fees, usage fees, web traffic fees, hourly fees, late fees, and other fees. Customer shall pay or otherwise be responsible for all federal, state, or local sales, use, excise, gross receipts, municipal fees, transfer, transaction, property, or similar taxes, fees, or surcharges imposed on, or with respect to, the Services under this Agreement.
3.2. If Customer has ordered a service on an automatic renewal basis (e.g., SSL certificates, domain name registrations, etc.), then Customer will be notified via email prior to the renewal dates. Failure of Customer to provide regiSTAR.com with notification of termination of the service with sufficient time prior to the renewal date for regiSTAR.com to cancel the service will result in a renewal of the service for a subsequent term.
3.3. All periodic payments are due on the account statement date or for other payments, when invoiced, or as otherwise may be agreed by regiSTAR.com. The account statement date is the anniversary (monthly, quarterly, annually or bi-annually) of the date the initial Services start date. Periodic payments are due in advance for the period covered.
3.4. If Customer provides regiSTAR.com credit or debit card or automatic bank withdrawal information (the “Payment Method”), Customer authorizes regiSTAR.com to automatically charge the Payment Method for all charges that apply to Customer’s account. Charges will be posted to Customer’s Payment Method without requiring additional authorization until such time that Customer cancels Customer’s account or the applicable Service. Customer is responsible for updating, or notifying regiSTAR.com, of any changes to Customer’s Payment Method (including, but not limited to card number, expiration date, billing address, or card status).
3.5. Customers not paying by an approved Payment Method agree to make payment of their balance due by no later than the account statement date, or for non-periodic and variable charges, within 10 days of the invoice date. Non-periodic and variable charges are billed monthly following the month in which the charges are incurred and may include charges for bandwidth, disk space, ecommerce transactions, hourly charges, and similar charges. Unless otherwise agreed, Customer shall pay in advance a deposit determined by regiSTAR.com for web design and development projects, with the balance paid upon completion, or prorated share monthly for projects extending beyond 30 days. Payment must be received by such due dates to avoid incurring late fees. regiSTAR.com does not mail paper invoices or statements. Statements and invoices can be viewed and printed through the Customer account settings.
3.6. regiSTAR.com may charge Customer interest on unpaid balances at the lesser of the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law, or, in regiSTAR.com’s discretion, a charge of $5.00. Accounts 15 days overdue are subject to suspension of Service without notice until any overdue account has been made current by paying any and all overdue invoices. Time necessary for account restoration after suspension may vary. regiSTAR.com may use a third-party service to collect unpaid amounts and may charge Customer attorneys’, collection, or other reasonable fees incurred to collect unpaid balances, and Customer consents to such charges.
3.7. If Customer disputes a charge, Customer must pay the whole amount to avoid service interruption and notify regiSTAR.com about the disputed amount. If regiSTAR.com validates Customer’s claim, Customer’s account will be credited with the validated amount. regiSTAR.com will not review or accept any billing error claims submitted more than sixty (60) days after disputed charges were incurred.
3.8. Customer specifically understands and agrees that for each “chargeback” Customer initiates to Customer’s credit card for fees paid to regiSTAR.com that Customer will be liable to regiSTAR.com (and regiSTAR.com may collect from Customer) a “chargeback fee” in the amount of $40.00. Upon the occurrence of any chargeback, regardless of cause, regiSTAR.com may suspend Customer’s account which includes suspension for all domain names, web hosting and email services associated with customer’s account. Additionally, Customer will be charged a $25.00 fee for all returned checks. regiSTAR.com does not charge fees for accepting payment via domestic bank wire, however, international wire transfers may be assessed a $20.00 processing fee by an intermediary bank. In addition, Customer’s issuing bank may also charge a fee for sending the wire. Please add these fees to the amount that Customer is sending to regiSTAR.com or the amount credited to Customer’s account will be less than the intended payment.
3.9. Customer will be liable for all unfunded term commitments on Customer’s account. For example, if Customer signed up for one (1) year of service and cancels the account (or the account is terminated) after five (5) months, the unpaid fees for the remainder of the term commitment will automatically accelerate and Customer will immediately become liable for all unpaid charges on Customer’s account.
3.10. Charges for bundled Services will be “unbundled” if a portion of the bundle of Services is terminated.
3.11. Customer understands and agrees that Customer is responsible for any network bandwidth, memory over usage, or other overage charges Customer incurs for using the Services, even if such overages arise due to Customer’s failure to protect Customer’s password or account privacy.
3.12. If Customer wishes to reactivate a closed or suspended account, Customer must first pay regiSTAR.com any outstanding balance. A $50.00 fee will be assessed if regiSTAR.com restores data files to a reactivated account. Also see provisions relevant for backups in Section 15 hereof.
3.13. 30-Day Money Back Guarantee: regiSTAR.com’s shared, reseller and cloud hosting plans carry a 30-day unconditional money back guarantee. If Customer is not completely satisfied with such regiSTAR.com Services within the first 30 days, Customer will be given a full refund of the fees paid in advance (excluding setup fees) upon plan cancellation. The following services do not qualify for the 30-day money back guarantee: dedicated hosting plans, web design and development, marketing and social media services, and overage fees.
3.14. All prices are subject to change at any time upon prior notice.
3.15. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments, including pre-payments, are non-refundable.
4. Account Changes; Cancellation:
4.1. Customers electing to change to a lower priced hosting plan on the same platform will be charged a $18.95 downgrade fee. There is no upgrade fee for upgrading to a higher priced plan, however, Customer will be charged any difference between the setup fee applicable to the new and former plans.
4.2. Hosting plans will automatically renew until a plan is cancelled. In order to cancel a Service, Customer shall open a Support Ticket through our website at regiSTAR.com. Cancellation of any service by phone, voice mail, text or email, will not be deemed an acceptable form of cancellation. Cancellation requests must be received by regiSTAR.com a minimum of 30 days prior to the end of a billing cycle for all hosting plans. Cancellations submitted later than this time may result in automatic renewal of the hosting plan. Unless otherwise indicated as “end of term,” Cancellations become effective on the day processed by regiSTAR.com. regiSTAR.com is unable to cancel an account effective for a future date, unless otherwise indicated as “end of term.” regiSTAR.com will confirm the cancellation request when it is processed. If Customer does not receive a confirmation, please contact regiSTAR.com as soon as possible by opening a Support ticket through our website. If regiSTAR.com believes that a hosting plan is being mistakenly cancelled, or that the cancellation will result in consequences unforeseen by Customer, then regiSTAR.com may leave the hosting active open, notify Customer of the reason for keeping the hosting plan active, and charge Customer for the hosting plan while remaining active.
4.3. By default all domain names are set to automatically renew. Customer may chose to disable this auto renew feature within the domain name control panel, otherwise known as the Client Area. To avoid the auto renewal of a domain name, this auto renew feature must be disabled at least 30 days prior to a domain name expiring. An automatically generated invoice will be generated for all domain name renewals based on the previous year(s) registration or renewal and will be automatically paid 2 to 3 days prior to a domain name expiring, providing the customer has stored credit card details within the Client Area. It will be the responsibility of the customer to manually renew their domain name(s) or pay the automatically generated invoice should the customer disable the auto renew feature. Requests for disabling the auto renew feature or the request to not renew a domain name by phone, voice mail, text or email, will not be deemed an acceptable form of cancellation. Cancellation requests must be received by regiSTAR.com by opening a Support Ticket through website a minimum of 30 days prior to a domain name expiring. Cancellations submitted later than this time may result in automatic renewal of a domain name. Unless otherwise indicated as “end of term,” Cancellations become effective on the day processed by regiSTAR.com. regiSTAR.com will confirm the cancellation request when it is processed. If Customer does not receive a confirmation, please contact regiSTAR.com as soon as possible by opening a Support ticket through our website. Customer is responsible for ensuring that a domain name was successfully renewed.
4.4. Account contacts, including the primary account contact, designated by Customer during registration, or as thereafter changed, are authorized to make changes to an account. Customer acknowledges and agrees that regiSTAR.com may rely for all purposes on authorizations issued by any account contact, and Customer waives any right of action against regiSTAR.com for complying with authorizations issued by the account contact. If an account is in dispute between multiple claimants, regiSTAR.com, may in its sole discretion, lock the account until agreement is reached between the claimants or regiSTAR.com receives an order of a court.
5. Service Level Agreement:
regiSTAR.com recognizes the importance of reliable web hosting services and offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee. Customer will receive a credit for the applicable portion of the hosting fees for any unannounced downtime in accordance with this Section, except when caused by a Force Majeure event, as defined in Section 20.7 hereof. Customer will receive a full day’s credit if downtime in a given day exceeds 20 minutes. Customer will also receive a full day’s credit if downtime in a given month exceeds 20 minutes (except where such credit is based upon 20 minutes of downtime in a given day, for which a separate credit is earned). For example, if there is 10 minutes of applicable downtime in each of three days in a given month Customer will receive a full day’s credit. If there was 25 minutes of applicable downtime in a single day Customer will receive a full day’s credit. If both situations occur in a given month Customer will receive 2 days credit. However, if there is only 25 minutes of downtime during a single day, then Customer will receive a full day’s credit for that day, but not an additional credit for the month. In order to claim a credit Customer must open a support ticket.
6. Maintenance Schedule:
regiSTAR.com has an international customer base. Therefore, given global time zones, there are no universally convenient times for performing scheduled maintenance on the regiSTAR.com servers. regiSTAR.com performs scheduled maintenance during hours between 10:00am and 6:00pm PST on Sundays when regiSTAR.com Administrative staff is readily available. In most cases, the performance of scheduled maintenance does not impact service and availability and regiSTAR.com makes all reasonable efforts to minimize any such impact on service and availability.
7. Support:
regiSTAR.com agrees to provide reasonable technical support by telephone or by opening a Support Ticket via our website to Customer during regiSTAR.com’s normal technical support hours. Support is limited to the primary account contact only, and limited within the scope to basic web hosting and domain name registration services only.
8. Unlimited and Unmetered Services:
regiSTAR.com may provide hosting Services which are designated as “unlimited” or “unmetered” which is to say they are not allocated a quota. However, web servers and networks have a finite amount of resources and therefore such Services are limited to those maximums as determined solely regiSTAR.com. Additionally, usage outside normal and necessary amounts may be considered abusive and is prohibited. This may include, but is not limited to, bandwidth, hard disk space, CPU and RAM. Please see our Acceptable Use Policy posted on the Website for more information.
9. Software Licenses and Use:
If regiSTAR.com provides or resells certain software or services to Customer, Customer understands and agrees that Customer may be bound by additional terms and conditions imposed by third-party resellers or licensors, which are also hereby incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, regiSTAR.com may provide certain background technology composed of computer programming/formatting code or operating instructions developed by or for regiSTAR.com to be used to host or operate a Customer website or a webserver in connection with a Customer website. Customer may use such background technology for the sole purpose of operating the website or webserver, and may not transfer or assign this right or the background technology. Customer may not duplicate or distribute any such background technology to any third party without the prior written consent of regiSTAR.com. All rights to such background technology not expressly granted to Customer hereunder are retained by regiSTAR.com. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer agrees not to reverse-engineer, reverse-assemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive any source code of the background technology, except as allowed by law. IF CUSTOMER IS A USER OF INSTAORDER ECOMMERCE OR WEBJURIS/RECE CMS, OR OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT ARE INDICATED BY regiSTAR.com TO BE LEGACY APPLICATIONS PROVIDED BY regiSTAR.com, SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND THE PROVISION OF SUCH APPLICATIONS TO CUSTOMER IS SUBJECT TO ALL WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 17.6.
10. Domain Name Registration Services; SSL Certificates:
If Customer registers, renews, or transfers a domain name through regiSTAR.com, regiSTAR.com will submit the request to a third party domain name services provider (the “Registrar”) on Customer’s behalf. regiSTAR.com’s sole responsibility is to submit the request to the Registrar. regiSTAR.com is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or failures of the Registrar. Customer’s use of domain name services is subject to the applicable legal terms of the Registrar posted at http://www.enom.com. Customer is responsible for closing any account with any prior reseller of or registrar for the requested domain name, and Customer is responsible for responding to any inquiries sent to Customer by the Registrar.
regiSTAR.com is a reseller of third party SSL certificate services. regiSTAR.com is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or failures of the third party SSL certificate service vendor. Customer’s use of the SSL certificate services is subject to the applicable legal terms of the SSL certificate services vendor located at http://www.rapidssl.com/legal/.
11. Credit Card Processing Customers:
regiSTAR.com, or its affiliates, are a registered sales office for certain third party payment processing and payment gateway service companies (the “Payment Processing Companies”). Credit card processing and payment gateway services are provided by the respective Payment Processing Companies and are not provided directly by regiSTAR.com. regiSTAR.com will only provide limited customer service for the Payment Processing Companies services. The Payment Processing Companies can be contacted directly for customer service. regiSTAR.com will not be liable for any fraudulent charges on Customer’s merchant account or any loss due to such activities. Refunds, if applicable, should be addressed to the appropriate Payment Processing Company. Customer is solely responsible for all activity occurring on Customer’s merchant account.
12. Privacy:
regiSTAR.com cares about the privacy of our customers. Please review the regiSTAR.com Privacy Policy. By using the Services, Customer is consenting to have personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Services, Customer is consenting to the terms of Privacy Policy.

13.1. Customer represents and warrants that all artwork, media, specifications, data, software, code, content, logos, and trademarks, in whatever form (the “Customer Content”), supplied by Customer for the design, development and operation of a Customer website is properly owned or licensed by Customer for such purposes, and does not infringe or violate any third party’s intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or any other right. Customer Content shall remain the sole property of Customer.
13.2. All web design and development Services shall be deemed complete and accepted upon the earlier of (i) written acceptance by Customer, (ii) completion and delivery in substantial compliance with applicable specifications, and (iii) use of such Services by Customer in production. Such Services shall be considered complete in substantial compliance with applicable specifications when regiSTAR.com has completed as much of its responsibilities as possible given any lack of information or Customer Content that was supposed to have been provided by Customer for use in the website design and development, but was not provided or has been delayed past the scheduled completion date of the project. regiSTAR.com reserves the right to charge, above and beyond the quoted or estimated project fees for consultations, on-site meetings, project planning, proof of concepts, additional artwork proofs or any work deemed out-of-the-scope of the project.
13.3. All work product, deliverables, applications, websites and artwork developed and/or provided by regiSTAR.com during the performance of the Services shall remain the sole property of regiSTAR.com (the “regiSTAR.com Materials”). Subject to payment of all amounts due and compliance with this Agreement, regiSTAR.com hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, single instance, single server, limited license to the regiSTAR.com Materials for use with a website owned and operated by Customer. This license may not be resold, or transferred, in whole or part, to a third party without the prior written consent of regiSTAR.com.
13.4. Customer understands and agrees that (a) regiSTAR.com or any applicable licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in and to any computer programming, formatting code, operating instructions, or other software used in providing the Services to Customer and (b) that Customer will not, and will not facilitate another to, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive any source code of any software.
13.5.

Such limited right will terminate automatically upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

Customer represents and warrants to regiSTAR.com that: (a) Customer owns or has the right to use all copyrighted and trademarked material contained in the Customer Content; and (b) the use, reproduction, distribution, and transmission of the Customer Content, or any information or materials contained in it, on and from regiSTAR.com’s servers will not: (i) infringe or misappropriate any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or any other proprietary rights of a third party; (ii) violate any criminal laws; (iii) constitute false advertising, unfair competition, defamation, an invasion of privacy, violate a right of publicity, or violate any other law or regulation.
14. Backups:
For its own operational efficiencies and purposes, regiSTAR.com backs up data on the managed and shared servers every 24 hours (which backups are deleted after 24 hours when the next backup is performed), but regiSTAR.com is under no obligation or duty to perform backups under this Agreement. regiSTAR.com charges a recurring annual fee of $50.00 for up to 10 file restorations per year. Restorations are made without any guarantee that the file or particular file version is available in the backup repository and does not include returning the file to working order. IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER’S DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BACKUP CUSTOMER’S FILES AND DATA, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL regiSTAR.com BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR LOSS OF CUSTOMER FILES AND/OR DATA ON ANY regiSTAR.com SERVER.
15. Monitoring and Disclosures:
All activities occurring on, in, and/or via the Services or any website hosted by regiSTAR.com may be monitored, recorded, and examined by any authorized person, including law enforcement. In general, regiSTAR.com does not monitor its Customer’s websites or activities to determine whether they are in compliance with this Agreement. However, when and if regiSTAR.com becomes aware of any violation of this Agreement, regiSTAR.com may take any lawful action, and in the event of illegal activity, will take action, to stop or correct such violation, including, but not limited to, shutting down a website, denying access to the Services or to the Internet via regiSTAR.com, and/or removing non-complying information. regiSTAR.com may disclose any information in its possession, including, without limitation, information about Customer, Internet transmissions and website activity in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation, governmental request, or other legal process to protect regiSTAR.com or others from harm, and/or to ensure the proper operation of the Services. regiSTAR.com has no obligation to notify any person, including Customer, about whom information is sought, that regiSTAR.com has provided the information. regiSTAR.com and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, regiSTAR.com and its designees shall have the right to remove any content that violates this Agreement, is illegal, is alleged to infringe any intellectual property rights or violate any person’s right of privacy, or is otherwise objectionable as determined in regiSTAR.com’s sole discretion.
16. Term and Termination:
16.1. This Agreement as updated from time to time will remain in effect until its termination by either party under its terms.
16.2. regiSTAR.com may terminate this Agreement, at its convenience, without cause, at any time upon notice to Customer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, regiSTAR.com may also, but has no duty to, immediately suspend or terminate the Services, terminate Customer’s access and password, remove Customer’s Service from regiSTAR.com’s servers, or remove any content within the Services, if regiSTAR.com concludes, in its sole discretion, that Customer (a) has breached, violated, or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement, including any applicable law or regulation; (b) has provided false information as part of account information; (c) has failed to keep account information complete, true, and accurate; (d) fails to respond to any email communication sent to the email address listed in account information; (e) is engaged in fraudulent or illegal activities or the sale of illegal or harmful goods or services; or (f) is engaged in activities or sales that may damage the rights or reputation of regiSTAR.com or others (each “Termination for Cause”). Any Termination for Cause by regiSTAR.com will take effect immediately, and Customer expressly agrees that Customer will not have any opportunity to cure.
16.3. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, both regiSTAR.com and Customer have the right to terminate web design and development projects for any reason at any time. Upon termination of a web design and development project, Customer will be responsible to pay for all applicable web design and development fees, and associated costs and expenses regiSTAR.com has incurred, or may incur as a result of such termination, through the termination date based upon the number of hours worked multiplied by regiSTAR.com’s normal published hourly rate. If a web design and development project has been terminated by regiSTAR.com, for regiSTAR.com’s convenience, Customer will receive a pro-rata refund for any amounts paid to regiSTAR.com for Services that has not been performed. This refund calculated by the number of hours worked multiplied by regiSTAR.com’s normal published hourly rate and subtracted from your web design and development payment(s). All regiSTAR.com Materials developed for Customer will be subject to the license grant set forth in Section 13.3 of this Agreement. In the event either party cancels a project, regiSTAR.com will deliver, via electronic means (FTP) all work for which Customer has paid.
16.4. Customer understands and agrees that upon termination of this Agreement regiSTAR.com has the right to immediately bar Customer’s access to any and all content related to the Customer’s website or account. Upon any termination of the Services, regiSTAR.com reserves the right to permanently delete from its servers any and all information and content contained in Customer’s account or Service, including but not limited to order processing information, mailing lists, files, email, and any web pages generated by Customer or the Services. regiSTAR.com accepts no liability for such deleted information or content.
17. Limitations; Indemnification; Disclaimers:
17.1. IN NO EVENT WILL REGISTAR.COM’S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ANY AND ALL BREACHES, DEFAULTS, OR CLAIM OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO REGISTAR.COM DURING THE ONE (1) CALENDAR MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OF LIABILITY AND $50.00. IN NO EVENT WILL REGISTAR.COM, ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, CONTRACTORS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY THIRD PARTY, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, MULTIPLE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR LOSS OF PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, THE FAILURE OF ANY LIMITED OR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE GROUNDS, EVEN IF REGISTAR.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE LIMITATIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS REGISTAR.COM WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
17.2. Depending upon what industry Customer is operating within or what type of data Customer processes or handles (e.g., medical or financial), there may be various security and related laws, regulations and standards with which Customer is obligated to comply, including, without limitation, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act), SOX (Sarbanes Oxley Act), (GLBA) Gramm Leach Bliley Act, HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health), and PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) (collectively, “Compliance Standards”). While regiSTAR.com may provide certain Services designed to assist Customer with compliance with certain Compliance Standards, actual compliance with Compliance Standards is solely Customer’s responsibility and regiSTAR.com is not responsible for ensuring that Customer’s systems operating in conjunction with the Services or regiSTAR.com equipment are compliant with the Compliance Standards. Additionally, the Compliance Standards include many features that are out of regiSTAR.com’s control including, without limitation, Customer’s network and business processes. ACCORDINGLY, REGISTAR.COM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE SERVICES, EQUIPMENT, SYSTEMS, NETWORK OR PROCESSES ARE COMPLIANT WITH ANY COMPLIANCE STANDARD AND REGISTAR.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT REGISTAR.COM WILL ACHIEVE SUCH COMPLIANCE IN THE FUTURE. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE AND VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH ANY COMPLIANCE STANDARD, CUSTOMER IS ADVISED TO ARRANGE FOR A THIRD PARTY TO AUDIT THE SERVICES, EQUIPMENT, SYSTEMS, NETWORK AND PROCESSES, UPON TERMS TO BE MUTUALLY AGREED. IF BASED UPON ANY SUCH AUDIT CUSTOMER DESIRES THAT REGISTAR.COM MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SERVICES, THE PARTIES WILL DETERMINE APPLICABLE TERMS FOR REGISTAR.COM TO IMPLEMENT ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS.
17.3. regiSTAR.com takes standard and reasonable precautions to protect website files and data. However, as online services, the Services are inherently subject to security vulnerabilities. Accordingly, regiSTAR.com does not guaranty the security of the Services or any data and files. regiSTAR.com highly recommends and advises that Customer obtain insurance coverage for general liability and professional liability errors and omissions and cyber liability. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT REGISTAR.COM IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE SECURITY OR LOSS OF CUSTOMER FILES AND DATA UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
17.4. Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless regiSTAR.com from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, fines and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought or claimed by a third party arising out of or related to any of the following: (i) actual or alleged use of the Services in violation of this Agreement or applicable law by Customer or any users (including any actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights by the Customer Content or website or arising from data or other content posted or stored on the Services or the Customer website by Customer or its Users); (ii) any dispute between Customer and its customers, contractors or users; or (iii) the operation or use of any Customer website or any data or content contained therein or transmitted thereby (including any breach of any terms of use or service, or license or other agreements, of any third party service provider by Customer or that is caused by Customer). regiSTAR.com shall notify Customer of any indemnified claim under this Section and provide Customer at Customer’s expense with information and cooperation as necessary for Customer to defend regiSTAR.com from such claim.
