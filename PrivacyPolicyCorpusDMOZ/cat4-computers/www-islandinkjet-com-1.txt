The Licensed Island Associate Program is an opportunity for you to download the non-revenue generating activities of your small business to the Associate group and gain a new partner that will contribute to the success of your business in a variety of ways also allowing you to focus your time where it should be focused- generating sales.
Our Retail Store Program
Environmental
Recycling is great, but Reusing is better. At Island Ink-Jet we believe in refilling and reusing cartridges whenever possible, before sending them for recycling and replacing them with a new one. Reusing an inkjet cartridge can save the energy and materials used in recycling it, decreasing the overall environmental impact of printing.

What truly sets us apart from other retailers and especially online stores is that our physical stores are Licensed & independently owned and operated by small business owners in your community.
When you order online at Island Ink-Jet you are supporting the locally owned businesses and economy in your community through our profit sharing model and you in turn receive localized support from those businesses.
No competitor can offer the same degree of localized support, sales and service as we can.
Much like how we pioneered the retail ink refill service, we are pioneering how online sales contribute to the local economy.
Shipping is free on printer cartridge orders of $49 or greater.
We ship out of distribution centres located on the east coast, west coast and a few in between using the best couriers such as FedEx and Purolator, thus ensuring that most orders ship same day and can be delivered the next business day.
Our in-house printer ink and toner cartridges offer industry-leading quality and are ISO 9001 certified.
Returns are hassle-free with no return shipping cost on defective products.

About Island Ink-Jet
In 2001 Island Ink-Jet launched our first retail store in Courtenay BC offering North America’s first retail printer cartridge refill service.
The service we pioneered was an instant hit and Island grew to one of the nation’s largest Canadian-owned retail chains in terms of store locations within a few short years.
Read More
Today Island Ink-Jet offers much more than an ink refill service. We are Canada’s leading source of printer ink and toner cartridges (OEM/name brand or compatible).
What may also surprise you is that we also carry a full line of office products (be it office furniture or pens & pencils) to make business procurement that much easier!
We believe that high quality products and services can be delivered to your door in a professional manner with no hassle and in the least amount of time. That’s why we choose to partner with companies like FedEx who get our packages to where they need to go in the least amount of time and without fail – often delivered the next business day.
With stores in most major markets, we believe strongly in the value of “putting a face to the name”. Learn more by visiting our “about us” page.

Buy with 100% Confidence!
Our entire website (not just the checkout page) features 256-bit SSL encryption ensuring your purchases are completely secure!
In a time where current “industry standards” are 128-bit – we believe in going the extra mile to ensure your identity is protected.
We also do not spam or resell your contact information.
Rest assured Island Ink-Jet and Laser Toners is a brand you can trust.

Island Ink-Jet Pricing Policy
Prices quoted on this website including any discounts found are available only when ordering online. We make every effort to keep our online prices competitive with the online marketplace.
In-store pricing and availability will differ from Island Ink-Jet online sites.
In-store pricing will usually be higher compared to prices quoted on this website due in part to the value-added service provided in-store and the additional costs incurred by the store while providing those value-added services.
It is a generally understood principle that companies can offer lower prices online due the lower costs incurred in providing an online shopping experience.
Here are some of the value added services consumers receive by buying in store: Product is available for immediate pick-up; consumers are able to deal face to face with an expert who can provide guidance, advice and troubleshooting tips; immediate resolution to any issues. Ancillary benefits include your support of your the local economy. It is noted that stores incur additional expenses such as rent, labour, overhead which make it impossible to offer the online price in store.
Island Ink-Jet cannot confirm the price of an item until after your order is placed.
Pricing errors may occur on the Island Ink-Jet website and Island Ink-Jet reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Island Ink-Jet.
Island Ink-Jet may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

Island Ink-Jet Shipping Policy
General Info
Orders received Monday to Friday before 2pm eastern are processed and shipped same day. Orders placed after 2pm on Friday or on Saturday or Sunday will be processed the following Monday. Delivery can take 1-5 business days and customer will receive tracking number to confirm shipment once order has left our warehouse(s).
Orders are shipped by courier (FedEx/Purolator) from any of our 8 distribution centres based on proximity of the items ordered to your door. It is common for most densely populated areas to receive their orders the next business day. Certain factors may contribute to orders taking up to 5 days such as availability of the items ordered at the closest distribution centre.
Special order items or orders placed outside of the local trading areas may take 5 or more business days to ship and can have a separate delivery charge based on the weight and delivery distance of the order.
In the event of a holiday, deliveries may be delayed. We observe many Federal and Provincial holidays across Canada.
If you are in an area that is observing a holiday and are unsure of your delivery date, please contact us.
Processing fees
In some cases an order cannot be filled by a single distribution centre such as if an order for two items is placed and only one is in stock at the closest distribution centre yet a second is available within another of our facilities. When this occurs, the order is processed to be shipped in its entirety from as many points as necessary to fill the order and have it arrive at your door in the least amount of time. Should this occur, only one processing fee may apply even if the order is processed to ship from several distribution centres. A processing fee will be visible during checkout (on the check-out screen) if applicable.
Shipping Charges
Our standard shipping charge applies on all orders, and is a flat rate of $8.50 Shipping costs are waived on all orders of $49 or more*.
*Free shipping not available in the Canadian Territories of Yukon, North West Territories and Nunavut
*"Free shipping” offer does not apply to oversized items including printers and copiers, office furniture. Shipping charges may apply and are billed/charged at time of shipping based on the actual cost of freight to destination. Contact us at 1-877-446-5538 if shipping quotes are required prior to purchase.
Delivery
Island Ink-Jet is not liable for delivery exceptions that may occur due to storms, natural disasters, receiving incomplete addresses or when the customer is unavailable to accept the delivery.
The Customer accepts that couriers will attempt delivery as requested by the Customer and should the Customer be unavailable to accept the delivery; the goods shall be physically deposited at the address.
Notwithstanding the above a notification may be left at the door advising that a second delivery attempt will be made or to provide instruction on how to pick up locally thereafter.
In the unlikely event that the package continues to remain unclaimed by the customer over the course of the following 10 days – it will be returned to the originating warehouse.
Returned shipments are eligible for refund however all actual shipping costs incurred (on both outbound and inbound shipments) are at the customers expense and will be subtracted from any refund provided.
The goods shall be deemed to have been delivered when they are physically deposited at the address given to the Company by the Customer or consignee for that purpose, or have been collected from the Company’s premises or an authorised agent of the Company.
The Customer accepts that no form of acknowledgement or signature that delivery has occurred is required to be obtained by the courier except in those instances where the Customer has specified, and the Company has agreed, that the Company obtain proof of delivery.
In the unlikely event that goods are lost after having been delivered, the Customer is advised to report the theft to local authorities and their insurance provider.
Store Pick-Up
Orders cannot be placed online for pick-up at one of our retail stores. Should you wish to pick up items, please contact your local retail store directly and they will be happy to assist.
P.O. Boxes
Most couriers cannot deliver to Canada Post office boxes.
Goods shipped to P.O. Boxes may incur additional delivery time.
In some cases entire product lines are ineligible for shipment to a P.O. Box.
Customers are advised to confirm that goods can be delivered to a P.O. Box prior to submitting their order.
Goods are shipped to the address provided by the Customer without review and if the address provided contains a P.O. Box – the goods will be shipped to that address despite the Post Office potential to decline the goods.
