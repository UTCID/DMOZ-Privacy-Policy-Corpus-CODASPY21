Licensing Terms & Service Policy
Licensing Terms
Purchasing a license for a FrameReady product allows you to install a single copy of the product on one single computer. Please note that the FileMaker Pro license is registered to Adatasol, Inc. and is bundled with FrameReady as part of an agreement between FileMaker Inc and Adatasol Inc. (contract #40289902). FileMaker Pro may be installed on one (1) computer.
If you wish to install FileMaker Pro on more than one computer for the purposes of networking then additional licensing must be purchased from Adatasol. Call 888-281-3303 to place your order for any additional licenses.
Other Licensing Terms
All new purchases include support and upgrades for 12 months.
Your license is non-transferrable and cannot be sold or exchanged, in most circumstances.
Your license is a perpetual license versus an annual license.
Support & Service Policy
Our Annual Subscription provides you with:
Access to our technical support team, via toll-free calling or email.
Access to the subscriber's section of the web site with training videos.
Twelve months of vendor pricing updates.
Maintenance Policy
Annual Software Maintenance provides you with access to our new product upgrades as listed below:
Software maintenance is only applicable to the most current version of the product.
A product upgrade is defined as any new software release (major or minor) for a license you have purchased.
If your maintenance period expires, you will need to renew it before we can provide you with access to the latest versions of our products.
If your maintenance period expires, and you fail to renew and a product release occurs, you will be required to pay the regular upgrade fee.
Refunds
We aim to make sure that our customers are satisfied with their purchase. For this reason, we offer users a 45-day free trial of the software to decide if the software is suitable for their needs.
Adatasol does not accept product returns. Instead, we encourage users to take advantage of our try-before-you-buy policy and use the 45-day free trial period before purchasing.
