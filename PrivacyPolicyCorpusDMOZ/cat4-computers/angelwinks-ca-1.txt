Privacy Policy for AngelWinks Heavenly Post Card Shoppe - Free Online Greeting Cards
*Welcome to AngelWinks Heavenly Post Card Shoppe*
Privacy Policy
I don't collect ANY private information from you.
Your name, nickname, address, email address, weight, bra size, number of lovers, eating habits, credit rating and political association is perfectly safe. As long as you are alive and well enough to send postcards, I am happy.
The ads on some of my pages pay for a small part of the hosting expenses.
The ValueClick ads do a bit of recording, but nothing personal. They contribute to some stats that are used to make pretty graphs that show what percentage of postcard senders and recipients use certain browsers and stuff like that. Some of them even use cookies to track what percentage of people have already seen certain ads and need fresh ones. If you dump those cookies, they will keep showing the same old ads until you get tired of them and leave the cookies alone.
The newfangled targeting is also used to make sure only family safe ads are shown here.
We use ValueClick, a third-party advertising company, to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (NOT including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click on networkadvertising.org .
