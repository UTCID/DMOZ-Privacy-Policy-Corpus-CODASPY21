Online Privacy Policy
We at PMEase ("PMEase" or "we") respect your individual privacy.
This privacy policy documents our adherence to the highest industry standards
for the protection of your personal information. The policy is effective as of July 1,
2008, applies to the site pmease.com and any other web sites of PMEase Software.
Why we collect personal information
We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer
service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services. In addition,
your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements,
software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.

What information we collect and how we may use it
PMEase is the sole owner of the information collected on the site.
PMEase may collect information at several different stages.
First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the site. This type
of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used
in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site.
Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable information
(name and e-mail address) when you sign up for a user account. Registration allows you to
activate/extend your QuickBuild service, generate your site licenses and otherwise access a broader range of online resources.
The same items of personal information are required if you subscribe to receive our newsletter,
or if you send an e-mail inquiry to our customer service department.
How we protect your personal information
PMEase takes precautions including administrative, technical, and physical measures
to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
PMEase does not sell, rent or share customer information with any third party not affiliated
with or owned by PMEase, except service providers who assist PMEase in such areas as data
storage or direct mailing. PMEase will never give or sell your personal information to be used
for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers (such as spam) from any third
party. We may send you infrequent e-mail notices regarding PMEase products or services that
may be of interest to you. You may choose not to receive these notices.
To make purchases from the PMEase, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Firefox,
Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality
of your personal and credit card information while it transmitted over the Internet.
You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the
Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make
sure you use a secure web browser like Firefox, Safari.
If you have any questions about the security at pmease.com, you can
send a message to Customer Service.

date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access
