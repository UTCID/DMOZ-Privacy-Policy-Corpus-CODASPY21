These cookies are generated by Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to obtain aggregated / averagred usage statistics: which countries visitors come from, which browsers they use, how long they stay on the site, etc. We do NOT send any personal data to Google Analytics.

When you post a comment and you are not logged in and you check the box "Remember me", then these cookies will be set for the sole purpose of pre-filling your personal details the next time you comment.
No SPAM!
This site asks you for your email address before you can post a comment or create an account. This serves 2 purposes:
Prevent a decent number of robots from posting automated content (spam).
Get in touch with you in the unlikely case there should be a security issue with your account, or if you have asked us a specific question.
We hate Spam and we value your privacy. We will NOT share your email address with anyone and we will NOT send you any unsolicited email.
100% of our transactional emails include a 1 click unsubscribe link. Same for newsletters you may have subscribed to.
Statistics
b2evolution also collects statistical data about what versions of b2evolution, MySQL, PHP & extensions are being used. This allows us to better evaluate which versions we still need to support (especially in case of security issues). It also allows us to know when new PHP or MySQL features are widespread enough for us to start taking advantage of.
We will NOT share any individual information (email, versions being used, etc.) with any third parties.
Private data
You can see/edit your private data here.
You can close/delete your account here.
No data selling
We will NOT sell your private and/or usage data to any third party. Period.
