Acceptance of Terms. These Sales and Refund Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) are applicable to purchases made from Celartem, Inc., d.b.a. Extensis (collectively “Extensis”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), including but not limited to Extensis’ website (the “Website). Please read these Terms carefully before making any purchase. By placing an order with Extensis or making a purchase through the Website, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Extensis’ Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not place an order or make a purchase through the Website.
Subscription Services for Software. Subscription service begins as soon as your payment is processed. You’ll be charged the annual fee stated at the time of purchase, plus applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, your subscription services will renew automatically on your annual renewal date. You can change this setting at any time after purchase, by editing the subscription settings in your Extensis My Products page. Renewal fees are subject to change, but we’ll always notify you beforehand. If you cancel within fourteen (14) days of your order, we will provide you with a full refund. You will need to contact Support directly to initiate a cancellation. Should you cancel after fourteen (14 days) from the date of purchase, your payment is non-refundable and your subscription services will continue until the end of your contracted term.
Non-Subscription Software. Your license to Extensis non-subscription software begins as soon as your payment is processed. You’ll be charged the fee stated at the time of purchase, plus applicable taxes. Extensis has a thirty (30) day return policy (from the date of purchase) on all non-subscription software that are licensed from Extensis. You will need to contact Support directly to initiate a return. Once the return has been processed, such software’s serial number will be retired to prevent further use. Any use of returned software is in violation of the applicable software license agreement and subject to prosecution under Federal Law.
Annual Service Agreements (ASA). An annual service agreement (“ASA”) may be offered with certain non-subscription software. If you choose to purchase ASA, the service will begin as soon as your payment is processed.

If you cancel ASA within fourteen (14) days of your date of purchase, we will provide you with a full refund. You will need to contact Support directly to initiate a cancellation. You may not cancel ASA after fourteen (14) days from your date of purchase and your ASA will continue until the end of your contracted term. Prior to any expiration of your contracted term for ASA, your contract for ASA must be renewed to maintain uninterrupted service. You will need to contact Support directly to renew your ASA. Renewal fees are subject to change, but we’ll always notify you beforehand.
Pre-paid Data Processing Services for Software. Your data processing services will begin as soon as your payment is processed. All fees must be pre-paid and will be based on the amount of data processing services purchased. You’ll be charged the fee stated at the time of purchase, plus any applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, your data processing services will expire one year from the date of purchase, and any unused data processing services will be forfeited at the time of expiration. You can purchase additional data processing services at any time after your purchase and any unused data processing services will be rolled over into your new annual term based on the date of your most recent purchase. Fees are subject to change, but we’ll always notify you beforehand. If you cancel your data processing services within fourteen (14) days of your order, we will provide you with a full refund minus any data processing services used up until the date of termination.
