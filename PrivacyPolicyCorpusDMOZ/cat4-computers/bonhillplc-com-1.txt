Why does Bonhill Group Plc need to collect and store personal data?
In order for us to provide you with a requested product or service, we need to collect personal data for correspondence purposes and detailed service provision.

Will Bonhill Group Plc share my personal data with anyone else?
We may pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to Bonhill Group Plc in the course of dealing with you. Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only to fulfil the service they provide you on our behalf or to provide information and services that are closely aligned to expressed preferences and interests. When they no longer need your data to fulfil this service, they will dispose of the details in line with Bonhill Group Plc’s procedures. If we wish to pass your sensitive personal data onto a third party we will only do so once we have obtained your consent, unless we are legally required to do otherwise.

Bonhill Group Plc is required to retain information in accordance with the law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes. How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.
Under what circumstances will Bonhill Group Plc contact me?
Our aim is not to be intrusive, and we undertake not to ask irrelevant or unnecessary questions. Moreover, the information you provide will be subject to rigorous measures and procedures to minimise the risk of unauthorised access or disclosure.
