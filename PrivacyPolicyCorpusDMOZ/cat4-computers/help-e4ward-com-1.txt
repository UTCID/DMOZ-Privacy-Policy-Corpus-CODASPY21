Privacy Policy¶
As an anti-spam service, we take your right to privacy very seriously.
Information collected by E4ward¶
We collect and store only the minimum amount of information necessary to create and securely maintain your account and provide a reliable forwarding service. This includes an account name, an encrypted password, a forwarding real email address (REA), a list of Forwards (a mapping of an alias email address to an REA), and an optional set of user-provided domain names that can be used in aliases.
E4ward will not sell, rent, or otherwise share personal data or email content with anyone, except as may be required by law.
Mail forwarded through E4ward is not stored on our servers.
IP addresses and Cookies.
We log IP addresses to insure the integrity of the service. We use a temporary session id cookie to keep track of the session while you are signed on.
Other¶
Users may delete their account at any time, whichs removes all account information from our servers. Once an account is deleted, the account name can not be used again.
E4ward does not contact users except for account-specific communications.
Changes to this policy.
Please note that this policy may change from time to time and any such changes will be posted on this page.
