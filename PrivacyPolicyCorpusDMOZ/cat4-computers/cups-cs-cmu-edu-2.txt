What does privacy mean to you?  We asked people to draw what privacy means to them. We went into schools to ask children of different ages, and we asked adults across the United States to contribute their images of privacy. Now we’re asking people around the world to add to our collection.
Explore our images. Click on the tags below to view our images sorted by theme, or read about some of the themes that have emerged. You can also view the whole collection together or view 15 random images.
