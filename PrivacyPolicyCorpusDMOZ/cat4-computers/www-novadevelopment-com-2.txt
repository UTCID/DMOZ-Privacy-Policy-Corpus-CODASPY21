How Your Information is Collected
Nova Development ("Nova," "our," "us" or "we") licenses access to our software, services and websites (the "Sites") (collectively, the "Services") to you ("you" or "your"), under our Terms of Use and any applicable End User License Agreement.
When you place an order on our website ("Sites") or by using our Services, or download, activate or register a product or Service with us, you will be prompted to provide (and we will collect) certain types of personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial information (such as your credit card number) and other unique information such as unique device identifiers, geo-location, user IDs and passwords, transaction information and product and service preferences. We also collect the e-mail addresses of customers who communicate with us via e-mail and those who provide their e-mail address when joining our mailing list. In addition, we collect personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided to us by visitors to our Sites or who use our Services in connection with activities such as contest participations, survey information and member account registrations.
We may collect non-personally identifiable (anonymous) information from all visitors to our Sites and users of our Services, regardless of whether they place an order with us or download software, volunteer such information, communicate with us, join our mailing list or otherwise. We may use such information and aggregate it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Sites and Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites and Services, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Sites and Services. We may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners, or disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Sites and Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
