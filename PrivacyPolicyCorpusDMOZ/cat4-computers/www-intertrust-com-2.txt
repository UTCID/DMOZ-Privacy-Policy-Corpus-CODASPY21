OWNERSHIP OF SITE MATERIALS
The “Site” includes all materials that comprise the Site, including, without limitation: all past, present and future versions of the Site, graphics, layout design, text, images, audio, video, designs, artwork, trade- and service marks, data, domain names, the “look and feel” of the Site, any and all copyrightable material (including source and object code), and all other materials related to the Site (collectively, “Materials”).
The Materials are owned by or licensed to Intertrust and are protected from unauthorized use, copying and dissemination by copyright, trademark, patent, and other laws, rules, regulations and treaties. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or expressly granted to you in writing by Intertrust, no rights in the Materials (either by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) are granted to you. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Materials by using the Site. You may only use the Materials as expressly set forth in these Terms. UNAUTHORIZED USE, COPYING, REPRODUCTION, STORAGE, MODIFICATION, REPUBLISHING, UPLOADING, DOWNLOADING, POSTING, TRANSMITTING, DISTRIBUTING, DUPLICATING, REMOVAL OR ALTERATION OF ADVERTISING, OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF ANY OF THE MATERIALS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms, Intertrust grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-commercial, revocable, non-assignable and non-transferable license to access and view the Materials (excluding source and object code, other than as made available to access and use via standard web browsers to enable display on your device). When you access or view the Materials, you must: (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices; (b) make no modifications to the Materials; and (c) not allow or assist any third party (whether or not for your benefit) to copy or adapt any object code associated with the Site or reverse engineer, modify, or attempt to discover any source code associated with the Site. You also agree that you will not (including by use of any robot, scraper, or other data mining technology or process) frame, mask, extract data or other materials from, copy, or distribute the Materials (except as may be a result of standard search engine or Internet browser usage). Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you may not copy, reproduce, republish, modify, create derivative works of, upload, download, perform, display, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise use Materials in any way, without the prior written permission of a duly authorized Intertrust employee. You agree to abide by any and all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in any part of the Site. Any and all rights to use the Site that are not expressly granted to you under these Terms are reserved for Intertrust or its licensors. Nothing contained in these Terms will affect, impair, or limit in any way Intertrust’s rights to exploit fully any or all of the Materials. Unauthorized use of Materials may be a violation of federal and state laws and could result in civil and criminal liability.

The Site may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in comments to blogs, forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (collectively, “Community Forums”). Through the Community Forums, you may choose to submit or post images, videos, writings, questions, comments, or other content (collectively, “User Content”).
You agree that your User Content will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will not be returned. You agree that you either: (i) own the rights to the User Content you submit and the right to grant all of the rights and licenses granted under these Terms; or (ii) you have all necessary rights and licenses from the owner(s) of these rights to enter into these Terms and grant Intertrust the license below. Upon Intertrust’s request, you will furnish Intertrust any documentation, substantiation, or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms.
You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and should be aware that submissions of User Content or other information may not be secure, and you should consider this before submitting any information to Intertrust or the Site.
You remain the owner of your User Content, but you acknowledge that Intertrust must have a license from you in order to accept your User Content. Accordingly, you grant to Intertrust and its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors in interest, licensees, and assigns, and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, agents, representatives and employees (each a “Intertrust Party” and, collectively, the “Intertrust Parties”) an unrestricted, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable and royalty-free license (but not obligation) to host, use, copy, distribute, display, perform, modify, translate, store or otherwise exploit all or any portion of your User Content for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any medium, technology or device now known or hereafter developed.
You further agree that Intertrust is free to use any ideas or concepts contained in any User Content for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services, and creating informational articles, without any payment or notice of any kind to you.

Except as prohibited by law, you waive any moral rights you may have in any User Content you submit, even if such User Content is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.
You agree that Intertrust has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content but has the right to protect and enforce its and its licensees’ rights to your User Content. You further acknowledge and agree that Intertrust will not have any obligation to you with regard to User Content and that Intertrust may or may not monitor, display, or accept your User Content and may delete it at any time.

If you have a good-faith belief that content on a Site infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below.
In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”), Intertrust has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and Intertrust follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA.

INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each of the Intertrust Parties from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, investigations, judgments, settlements, attorneys’ fees, and other expenses that arise from or are related to, directly or indirectly, any of the following: (a) your breach or anticipatory breach of these Terms; (b) your use of the Site or activities in connection with the Site; (c) your User Content and use of Applications; (d) your violation of any law, rule, regulation, code, statute, ordinance or order of any governmental and quasi-governmental authority, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; (e) information or material transmitted through your computer (even if not submitted by you) that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy or other right of any person, or defames any person; (f) any misrepresentation made by you; or (g) the Intertrust Parties’ use of your information as permitted under these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any other written agreement between you and Intertrust.

TERMINATION

Intertrust also reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms. Any violation of these Terms may be referred to law enforcement authorities. Any provision of these Terms, which by its terms, ought to survive, shall survive any termination of these Terms.
CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE
The laws of the state of California shall govern the construction and interpretation of this Agreement and shall apply to any disputes arising from it to the extent permitted by applicable law, regardless of conflict of laws principles. Subject to the arbitration provisions below, you and Intertrust hereby agree to submit exclusively to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts with jurisdiction over Santa Clara County, California and/or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes. You and Intertrust agree that any Disputes (defined below) will be settled by binding arbitration instead of litigating the Dispute in court. Arbitration means that Disputes will be heard and decided by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. You and Intertrust also agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the arbitrability of all Disputes between you and Intertrust, and the interpretation and enforcement of this section. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Intertrust arising out of or relating to these Terms or your accessing or use of the Site, whether based in contract, law, equity, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), including, without limitation, any dispute, claim or controversy concerning the validity, enforceability, or scope of these Terms; provided, however, that “Dispute” does not mean or include any action: (1) filed by you or by Intertrust in small claims court; (2) brought by Intertrust regarding its intellectual property rights; (3) brought by Intertrust against an individual or entity that engaged in unauthorized use or receipt of Intertrust products, services or unauthorized access to Intertrust systems, facilities, products, or services; or (4) the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision.
Individual Arbitration Actions Only; Class Action Waiver. BOTH YOU AND INTERTRUST WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO BRING OR RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE AS A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. BOTH YOU AND INTERTRUST WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION RELATED TO ANY DISPUTE THAT IS BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THE AAA RULES (DEFINED BELOW) TO THE CONTRARY, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OR ANY JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE ARBITRATION AS A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN, OR OTHERWISE COMBINE THE CLAIMS OF DIFFERENT PERSONS INTO ONE PROCEEDING.
Arbitration Rules, Jurisdiction and Venue. The arbitration will take place in the United States in the county of Santa Clara, California. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as superseded by these Terms. These Terms govern in the event they conflict with the AAA Rules. Unless you, Intertrust or the arbitrator requests a hearing, the parties will submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing. The arbitrator will make an award based only on the documents. This is called a Desk Arbitration. If any party makes a written request for a hearing within ten days after the American Arbitration Association acknowledges receipt of a claimant’s demand for arbitration (or the arbitrator requests a hearing), the parties shall participate in a telephonic hearing. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. The arbitrator will make any award in writing (“Arbitration Award”) but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The Arbitration Award shall be judicially enforceable. Any court of competent jurisdiction may, and upon request shall, enter judgment on the Arbitration Award. Either party may seek confirmation (judgment on the award) and/or enforcement in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Severability of Dispute Resolution Provision. If any clause within this Dispute Resolution provision (other than subsection (b), “Individual Arbitration Actions Only; Class Action Waiver,“ above) is found to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and the remainder of this Dispute Resolution provision will be given full force and effect. If subsection (b) of this Dispute Resolution Provision is found to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the arbitration requirements of this Dispute Resolution provision will be void in their entirety, the Dispute at issue will be decided by a court, and, in any such instance, you and Intertrust hereby each waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.
