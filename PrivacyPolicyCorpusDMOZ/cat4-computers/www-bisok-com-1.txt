Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy defines, documents, communicates and assigns accountability for how BIS collects, uses and manages information submitted at www.bisok.com. BIS does not sell user or client information. BIS is committed to respecting and protecting privacy rights while visiting www.bisok.com, www.grooper.com, BIS’s Grooper software user forum (“Grooper x Change”) and BIS’s blogs (“VIA,” etc.), collectively “BIS’s website” or simply “the website.” Unless otherwise posted on a specific webpage visited, this Privacy Policy explains your rights and expectations of privacy while visiting any webpage of the website.
Information Collected
Certain webpages of this website may ask you to voluntarily provide information in a form interface that personally identifies you (“personal information”). Such personal information may include your name, age, phone number, street address and e-mail address. BIS will specifically describe what information is required in order to respond or provide you with the information or service you have requested. You may also browse the website without registering or providing any such personal information.
Employment applications and related information submitted by applicants are handled by one or more third parties, reachable by links found at www.bisok.com. BIS itself does not directly collect, use or retain personal information of its applicants, except for limited contact information for the sole purpose of processing applications.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, BIS does not directly collect, use, share or retain personal information of its clients or their customers, except for information limited to contact information for the sole purpose of billing and other administrative functions, or otherwise volunteered. BIS strives to not disclose any client information to third parties without implicit or explicit consent. BIS has implemented state of the art physical, administrative and technical controls in order to protect client information against unauthorized access both online and offline. Any personal or sensitive data is stored in a secure data center dedicated to safekeeping and accessed only by necessary employees.
Additionally, clients who store in BIS’s facilities any documents, data and other information that may contain confidential and/or personal information do so with the understanding that BIS is contractually obligated and strives at its utmost to protect such information with the same physical, administrative and technical controls. Continuous compliance with and monitoring of privacy policies and procedures are enforced in order to prevent and/or address any privacy-related complaints and disputes.
