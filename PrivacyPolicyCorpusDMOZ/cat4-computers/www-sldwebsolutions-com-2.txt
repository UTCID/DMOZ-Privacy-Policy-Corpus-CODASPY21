Arbitration
In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute
between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity
for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by
final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,
conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the
parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having
jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in
regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of
these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort
claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that
the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this
arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.
Class Action Waiver
Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take
place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS,
COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and
SLDWEBSOLS agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding.
