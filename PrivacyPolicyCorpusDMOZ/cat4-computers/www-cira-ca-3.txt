Employment at CIRA
We advertise employment opportunities on our Website. In connection with a job application or related inquiry, you may provide us with information that identifies you (such as that contained in a resume, cover letter, or similar employment-related materials). We use this information for the purpose of processing and responding to your application for employment.
Customer Service
When you contact our Customer Service Department, or otherwise contact us or one of our service providers for support, or with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name and contact information), along with additional information we need to help us provide support, answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may also retain this information to assist you in the future, and to improve our customer service.
Disclosures of Personal Information
We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information, to any third party other than as set out in this policy.
WHOIS Information
As part of the administration of the .CA Registry, CIRA operates an electronic look-up service called "WHOIS". WHOIS is designed to provide limited information concerning Domain Names.
WHOIS has built-in privacy protection options, which can be used to limit the personal information available through the WHOIS system. For Registrants who are individuals (e.g. as opposed to organizations), the privacy protection options are turned on by default, and only limited personal information is available to third parties when they search the WHOIS system for a Domain Name that you have registered. If you turn your privacy protection option off, more of your personal information will be available through the WHOIS system. Your privacy protections can be changed by contacting your Registrar.
When your privacy protection is turned on, the following information is visible:
Domain Name;
Domain Name status;
Creation date;
Expiry date;
Updated date;
Registrar name; and
Registrar number.
When your privacy protection is turned OFF, the following information is visible
Registrant Information includes:
Registrant name;
Mailing address, e-mail address, phone number and fax number;
Domain Name Information includes:
Domain Name;
Domain Name status;
Creation date;
Expiry date;
Updated date;
Registrar name; and
Registrar number.
Administrative Contact Information and Technical Contact Information includes:
Name;
Mailing address;
Phone;
Fax; and
E-mail.
If you are a non-individual Registrant, the information that will be made available through the WHOIS system will be the same as an individual Registrant with their privacy protection turned OFF. Non-individual Registrants may request to CIRA, in writing, that the information described above not be disclosed to the public via the WHOIS. In such a written request, the non-individual Registrant must certify that it has a legitimate need to protect the privacy of its information, which need is greater than that of other CIRA Registrants who are not individuals, because the nature of that Registrant’s operations or activities is such that disclosure of its information via the WHOIS would be likely to cause harm to individuals or to that Registrant.
CIRA retains the discretion to determine in any case whether a non-individual Registrant meets the criteria and will be permitted to opt out of standard disclosure of information in the WHOIS. If CIRA accedes to the request, the non-individual Registrant’s WHOIS information will only be disclosed thereafter in accordance with the terms for disclosure applicable to individual Registrants.
Domain Name Disputes and Law Enforcement
CIRA has established policies on the disclosure of registration information for Domain Name disputes and law enforcement purposes.
(i) Domain Name Disputes
CIRA has implemented two policies, entitled Registration Information Access Rules and Procedures and Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information - Rules and Procedures, that address disclosures in the course of Domain Name disputes.
Under the Registration Information Access Rules and Procedures policy, CIRA will provide a person, who requests in the applicable form, a list of the .CA Domain Names registered in the name of a Registrant or registered in the name of the same Registrant as a Domain Name identified by the requester, even where the identity of the Registrant is unknown. This is done to facilitate bona fide rights holders to determine infringements of intellectual property rights.
Under the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information – Rules and Procedures, CIRA may provide a person, who requests in the applicable form, certain Registrant information not publicly available through CIRA’s WHOIS.
Information disclosed to requesters includes:
The name of the Registrant;
The mailing address and e-mail address of the Registrant;
The name of the Registrant’s Administrative Contact and Technical Contact; and
The mailing address and e-mail address of the Administrative Contact and Technical Contact
If a Domain Name that you have registered is subject to a proceeding under the CIRA Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, your personal information may also be disclosed to the relevant Dispute Resolution Service Provider to facilitate the dispute resolution process.
(ii) Requests from Law Enforcement
CIRA has implemented a policy entitled Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information for Law Enforcement and National Security Agencies - Rules and Procedures that addresses disclosures for law enforcement purposes. Under this policy, CIRA may provide a Law Enforcement Requester, who requests in the applicable form, certain Registrant information not publicly available through CIRA’s WHOIS.
Information disclosed to Law Enforcement Requesters includes:
The name of the Registrant;
The mailing address and e-mail address of the Registrant;
The name of the Registrant’s Administrative Contact and Technical Contact; and
The mailing address and e-mail address of the Administrative Contact and Technical Contact.
(iii) Notification
If a Registrant’s information is disclosed pursuant to the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information – Rules and Procedures, or the Request for Disclosure of Registrant Information for Law Enforcement and National Security Agencies – Rules and Procedures, we shall, unless prohibited by law, not less than thirty (30) and not more than sixty (60) days after disclosure of the personal information, use reasonable efforts to send an e-mail to the Registrant and Administrative Contact  for the relevant Domain Name Registration(s) indicating:
what parts of the information were disclosed; and
to whom it was disclosed.
Service Provider Arrangements
We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to host our website, operate certain of its features, send e-mail, run our surveys and contests, conduct customer research, and manage and analyze data. These third parties may be based in Canada, the United States or in other foreign jurisdictions.
Before transferring (or otherwise making available) any personal information to any third party service provider, CIRA enters into an agreement with the service provider pursuant to which it is required to use the personal information solely for the purpose of providing the service and to maintain security and privacy measures at least as stringent as those of CIRA. Our service providers are only given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.
Legal
In the event that personal information is transferred outside of Canada to the United States or other foreign jurisdictions, it will be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction. CIRA, and its Canadian, U.S. and other foreign service providers may  disclose your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, U.S. or other law. We may also disclose your personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
