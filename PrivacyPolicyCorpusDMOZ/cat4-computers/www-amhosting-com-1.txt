Domain Name Privacy Protection
Without Domain Name Privacy Protection your name, home address, phone number, and email address are listed in a public database. Domain Name Privacy Protection protects your privacy.
What is Domain Name Privacy Protection?
All domain names are required to list contact information in a public database. The contact information listed includes your full name, home address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.
Domain Name Privacy Protection protects your privacy by hiding your personal contact information.
How it works
You license the contact rights to another company. Their contact information is used in place of yours.
Unlike other similar services, with our service you will still be the owner of the domain name.
The feature can be enabled and disabled using the tools in the Account Manager
