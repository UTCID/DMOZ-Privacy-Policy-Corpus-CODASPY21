About Oracle
Strategic Acquisitions
Oracle and AppForge
Oracle Buys AppForge
Oracle has acquired the intellectual property assets of AppForge, a company formerly based in Atlanta with a mobile application development and mobile applications platform. Oracle has also hired several former employees of AppForge. This intellectual property extends Oracle's mobile applications product strategy.
Customers are increasingly using devices such as Palm, Symbian, Windows Mobile 5, and BlackBerry, to conduct real-time communications and transactions while mobile, and now Oracle will be better able to address these requirements and develop mini-applications to help executives, sales teams
and field service engineers be more productive.
We continue to focus on mobile tools to offer our customers better insight, enable them to make better decisions, and help them achieve better results. Please note that Oracle's acquisition of AppForge's intellectual property did not include the purchase of the company as a whole, or the purchase of other AppForge assets including its customer contracts.
Accordingly, Oracle does not plan to sell or provide support for former AppForge products going forward. If customers have any questions about Oracle's purchase of the AppForge intellectual property assets, please feel free to contact acquisition-inquiries_ww@oracle.com.
