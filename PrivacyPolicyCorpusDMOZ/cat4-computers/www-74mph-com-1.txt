Privacy Policy
Our Visitors:
Our Web Server retains NO personal information about our visitors.
However, in the normal course of operating a website, "page
hits" are logged, so your IP does end-up as part of a log.
These logs are part of our web server, or part of an external service
that monitors system performance.
The only personal information we collect is what you voluntarily
offer during message board registration.
Otherwise, we will never
rent or sell your email address to anyone.
Our Customers:
Our sales records are kept strictly confidential.
The only information that is displayed online is what you willingly
provide us in the form of a "testimonial" or referral.
We may post your company name in our "List of Customers"
portion of the website. If you don't want your company name to appear
in our list of customers, let us know, and we'll take if down, immediately.
We may, from time to time use a reputable "testimonial"
gathering service which also takes your privacy seriously. These
services, however, rely on us providing an e-mail list of existing
customers.
Otherwise, we never rent
or sell your email address to anyone.
Cookies:
Our website does not set any cookies on your machine.
However, our forum requires temporary cookies to function, and
are only used to keep you logged in between messages and sessions.
Your Privacy:
If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, if
you'd like to amend any information you've provided please let
us know by contacting us.
If you have any questions
regarding this policy, please contact us.
