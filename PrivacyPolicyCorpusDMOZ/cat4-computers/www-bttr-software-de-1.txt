Cookies
Cookies are small text
files stored by us inside your browser. This allows us to give your browser
a short- and long-term memory.
In general, all cookies
we set are necessary to provide functionality on our sites.
Server Logs
The web server hosting
our site at
Artfiles New Media GmbH will log each
page access. This log will also contain some personal data:
your IP address
the referrer (where
you came from)
your browser identification
This information is necessary
for legal reasons and to analyse and prevent abuse. This allows us to keep users
away who try to crash our server or to have necessary evidence in case of illegal
or criminal activity. Our server logs are automatically deleted after 7 days.
We will only keep log files longer when they are needed as evidence during an
investigation.

Forum Posts
When you edit a page in
the wiki or post to the forum, we log the following personal data:

block users who vandalize the wiki or the forum. And your username allows us
to credit you.

for an account in our wiki or our forum you need to provide the following minimal

All other data is optional.
When you want to delete
your account, write an email to webmaster at bttr-software dot
