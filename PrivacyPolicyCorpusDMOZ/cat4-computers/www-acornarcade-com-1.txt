Privacy Policy
We promise not to sell your details to anyone
We don't track anything more than general stats (e.g. how many people use RISC OS, or how many people use Internet Explorer)
We require accounts and cookies if you want to post anything, partly for convenience, and partly because it cuts down on the naughty people posting spam.
You can read pretty much anything without having to accept cookies however.
If you post on the forums, we do show how many posts you've made.
And there's a page showing what threads you've been contributing to recently.
But that's about it.
