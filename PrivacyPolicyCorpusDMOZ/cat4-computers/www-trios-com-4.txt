You can tell us any time to stop using information about you to market our products and services or to stop sharing information with other companies in the triOS group of Companies.
If you wish to refuse consent or to withdraw consent as outlined within this policy, you may do so at any time by contacting the office of triOS with whom you deal with.

When you apply for, or accept, or guarantee a loan or credit facility and during the course of the loan or credit facility, we may use, give to, obtain, verify, share and exchange credit and other information (except health information) about you with others including credit bureaus, collection agencies, and other persons with whom you may have financial dealings, as well as any other person as may be permitted or required by law. You authorize any person whom we may contact in this regard to provide such information to us.
During the term of the loan or credit facility, you may not withdraw consent to our ongoing collection, use or disclosure of your personal information in connection with the loan or other credit arrangement you have with us or have guaranteed.
