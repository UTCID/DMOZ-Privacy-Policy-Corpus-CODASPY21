The University of Illinois System appreciates user cooperation with this federally mandated requirement.
Users under the age of thirteen and their parents or guardians are cautioned that the collection of personal information volunteered online or by e-mail by children under the age of thirteen 1) will be treated the same as information given by an adult until the System becomes aware that the user is under the age of thirteen, and 2) such information may be subject to public access.
