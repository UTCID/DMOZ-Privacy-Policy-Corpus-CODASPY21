Privacy notice
Privacy notice for Saarland University websites
Saarland University regards the protection of personal data as an essential part of its digitalization strategy. Ensuring that individuals have the right to decide on the disclosure and processing of their personal data is of utmost priority to the university. This privacy notice refers to the websites that Saarland University is responsible for. If the scope of data processing on a Saarland University website goes beyond the procedures described here, this will be stated explicitly on the relevant website.
Name and address of the data controller
The data controller as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation, national data protection laws of member states and other data protection regulations is:
Saarland Universityrepresented by the University PresidentCampus66123 SaarbrückenTel.: +49 681 302-0postzentrale(at)uni-saarland.de
Contact details for the data protection officer
Meerwiesertalweg 1566123 SaarbrückenTel.: +49 681 302-2813datenschutz(at)uni-saarland.dewww.uni-saarland.de/datenschutz
General information on data processing
Purpose and scope of processing personal data
Saarland University processes personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website, to deliver website content and to offer services. As a rule, personal data are only processed after the user gives their consent. An exception applies in those circumstances in which it is not possible to obtain the user's prior consent and the processing of such data is permitted by law.
Legal basis for processing personal data
Art. 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms the legal basis for Saarland University to obtain the consent of a data subject for their personal data to be processed.
Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR forms the legal basis for processing personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party. This also applies if data have to be processed prior to entering into a contract.
Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR forms the legal basis if personal data have to be processed in order to fulfil a legal obligation on the part of Saarland University.
Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR forms the legal basis when processing of personal data is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.
Insofar as Saarland University is acting to fulfil its legally assigned research and teaching duties, the legal basis for processing data is Section 3(13), Saarland Higher Education Institutions Act.
Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR forms the legal basis if data processing is necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of Saarland University or of a third party except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
Erasure of data and storage period
The personal data of the data subject are erased or blocked as soon as the reason for storing them ceases to exist. Storage beyond this time period may occur if provided for by European or national legislators in Union regulations or national legislation and rules to which the data controller is subject. Such data shall also be blocked or erased if a storage period prescribed by one of the aforementioned legal standards expires, unless further storage of the data is necessary for entering into or performing a contract.
Providing content and log files
Description and scope of data processing
Each time a Saarland University website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the user's computer system in order to deliver website content. The following data are collected:The user's IP addressDate and time of accessReferrer websiteData transfer sizeHTTP error code (error log)The data are stored in our system's log files. We do not store the user's IP addresses or other data that make it possible to assign the data to a specific user. The IP addresses are truncated by the last two octets (e.g: 192.168.xxx.xxx). These data are not stored together with the user's personal data.
Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to deliver the website to the user's computer. The user's IP address is stored for the duration of the session.
Data are stored in log files to ensure the website's functionality. These data also help us optimize the website and ensure that our IT systems are secure. Data evaluation for other purposes does not take place in this context.
The purposes stated above constitute our legitimate interests in processing data in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Storage period
Data are erased as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected. Data that have been collected for the purpose of providing the website are erased at the end of the respective session.
Data stored in log files are erased after no more than seven days. A longer storage period is possible. In this case, the users' IP addresses will be erased or shortened by the last two octets (e.g: 192.168.xxx.xxx), so that they cannot be assigned to specific users.
Options for filing an objection or requesting removal
The collection of data for the purpose of providing the website and the storage of such data in log files is essential to the website's operation and the user cannot therefore object to such use.
Use of cookies
Description and scope of data processing
Saarland University websites may use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored by the web browser on the user's computer system. When a user accesses a website, a cookie may be stored in the user's operating system. This cookie contains a character string that allows the unique identification of the browser when the website is accessed again.
We use cookies to make the browsing experience more user-friendly. Some elements of our websites require that the requesting browser can also be identified after changing pages or when using specific services. In such cases, the user is informed about the use of cookies for analysis purposes, and their consent to the processing of the personal data used in this context is obtained. The user will also be informed about this privacy notice.
Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for the processing of personal data with the use of cookies is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Once the user has granted consent, the legal basis for data processing with the use of cookies for analysis purposes is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
Cookies that are required for technical reasons are used to enhance the user experience. Some functions on Saarland University websites cannot be offered without the use of cookies. In order for these functions to work correctly, it is necessary that the browser is recognized when the user accesses another page.
The user data collected by cookies that are required for technical reasons are not used to create user profiles.
Storage period, options for filing an objection or requesting removal
As cookies are stored on the user's computer and are transmitted from it to our website, users have full control over the use of cookies. Users can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in their web browser. Cookies that are already stored can be erased at any time. This may also be done automatically. If you deactivate cookies on a Saarland University website, you may not be able to use some of the website's functions in full.
Newsletters
Description and scope of data processing
Some Saarland University websites offer subscription to a free newsletter. If you register for a newsletter, the data from the input form will be transmitted to us.Email addressArea of interestNewsletter frequencyRegional or national editionIn addition, the following data are collected during registration:User's IP addressDate and time of registrationIn the course of the registration process, we request the user's consent for processing personal data and draw their attention to this privacy notice.
No data are disclosed to third parties in connection with data processing for the dispatch of newsletters. Such data are used exclusively for the purpose of sending the newsletter.
Legal basis for data processing
Once the user has granted consent, the legal basis for data processing following the user's registration for a newsletter is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The user's email address is needed to deliver the newsletter.
Storage period
Data are erased as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected. Users' email addresses are therefore stored for as long as they subscribe to the newsletter.
Options for filing an objection or requesting removal
Users may unsubscribe from a newsletter at any time. Each newsletter contains a link for this purpose. This also allows subscribers to revoke their consent to the storage of personal data collected during the registration process.
Contact form and contact by email
Description and scope of data processing
Contact forms are available on some Saarland University websites and may be used to contact us electronically. If a user contacts us in this way, the data they enter in the input form are transmitted to us and stored. As the data collected are specific to each contact form, please refer to the relevant contact form.
The following data are also stored when the message is transmitted:The user's IP addressDate and time of registrationBefore the message is sent, we request the user's consent for processing their personal data and draw their attention to this privacy notice.
Alternatively, they contact us using the email address provided. In this case, the personal data of the user transmitted with the email will be stored.
No data are disclosed to third parties in connection with the data processing required for this purpose. The data are used exclusively for processing the conversation (i.e. email communication) with the user.
Legal basis for data processing
Once the user has granted consent, the legal basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted by email is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If the purpose of the email contact is to enter into a contract, the additional legal basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The personal data from the input form are processed solely for the purpose of contacting the user. If the user contacts us by email, this also constitutes our legitimate interest in processing the data.
All other personal data processed during the transmission of an email prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure that our IT systems are secure.
Storage period
Data are erased as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected. This is the case for the personal data from the contact form and those data sent by email when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation will be deemed to have ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the subject matter in question has been conclusively settled.
Any additional personal data collected during the transmission process will be erased after a period of no more than seven days.
Options for filing an objection or requesting removal
Users can withdraw their consent for the processing of their personal data at any time. If the user contacts us by email, they may withdraw their consent for the storage of their personal data at any time.
In such cases, the conversation cannot be continued and all personal data stored when contact was made will be erased.
Web analysis using Matomo (formerly PIWIK)
Scope of processing of personal data
Saarland University websites may use the Matamo open-source software tool (formerly PIWIK) to analyse our users' browsing behaviour. The software places a cookie on the user's computer (please see above for more information about cookies). If the user accesses individual pages on a Saarland University website, the following data are stored:Two bytes of the user's IP addressThe accessed websiteThe referrer websiteOther pages retrieved via the accessed websiteTime on siteAccess frequencyNumber of actions on the website (page views, downloads, use of external links, internal search queries)The software used for such analyses runs exclusively on our servers. Users' personal data are stored on these servers only. Data are not disclosed to third parties.
The software is configured so that it does not store IP addresses in full, but instead marks two bytes of the IP address (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, the truncated IP address can no longer be traced to the accessing computer.
Legal basis for processing personal data
The legal basis for the processing of users' personal data is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
Processing our users' personal data allows us to analyse their browsing behaviour. By evaluating the collected data we are able to collate information about the use of Saarland University websites. This helps us to continuously improve our content and user-experience. The reasons stated above constitute our legitimate interests in processing data in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Anonymizing the IP address takes appropriate account of users' interests in the protection of their personal data.
Storage period
Data are erased as soon as we no longer need them for tracking purposes, which in our case means after six months.
Options for filing an objection or requesting removal
As cookies are stored on the user's computer and are transmitted from it by a Saarland University website, users have full control over the use of cookies. Users can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in their web browser. Cookies that are already stored can be erased at any time. This may also be done automatically. If you deactivate cookies for a Saarland University website, you may not be able to use some of the website's functions in full.
Our users can opt out of the analysis process. To do this, you must uncheck the corresponding check box. This places an additional cookie on the user's system that signals to our system not to store the user's data. If the user subsequently deletes this cookie from their own system, they must set the opt-out cookie again.
You can find further information about Matomo software and its privacy settings under the following link: https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/
