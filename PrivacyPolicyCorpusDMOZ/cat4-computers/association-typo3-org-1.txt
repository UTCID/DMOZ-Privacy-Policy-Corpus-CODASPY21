TYPO3 Association
The TYPO3 Association
Coordinates and funds the long-term development of TYPO3 CMS.
The TYPO3 Association builds the groundwork for the TYPO3 project. We empower our community with infrastructure and guidance. Our decisions are long term oriented.Our projects and activities
The income from memberships, donations and events is essential to the TYPO3 project. We funnel approximately €650,000 back into core development and community projects every year. Anyone can apply for funding. Funding budgets are approved by the Expert Advisory Board once a year, following an open review process.
In 2016, the TYPO3 Association founded TYPO3 GmbH (colloquially “The TYPO3 Company”), a fully-owned service company providing support and services. The company will also facilitate the development of the CMS.
