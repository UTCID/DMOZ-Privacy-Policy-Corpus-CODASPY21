ABOUT THIS CASE
Helping Business Owners Move Forward
From there onwards, we help set up businesses, with a careful understanding of regulation, timelines and when applicable permits. The firm advises in corporate governing matters, in the setup of multi-class stock corporations, in complex multi-jurisdiction corporate structures, and in strategic alliances and joint ventures among local or foreign-owned companies. Many of our professionals are either general advisors or members of the board of directors of client companies.
Background

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion means that we are continually working. Previous efforts in recruitment, retention and promotion of diverse attorneys.
