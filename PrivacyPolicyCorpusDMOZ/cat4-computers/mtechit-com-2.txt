Privacy Protection
Privacy Protection
Safely manage sensitive or personally identifying data, such as termination dates or SSNs.
Hitachi ID Bravura Identity attaches access rights not to sets of users but
to types of relationships, using user classes.
This is essential
to privacy protection, as illustrated by the following example:
Consider a very sensitive profile attribute -- scheduled termination
date.
This may be mundane as it applies to contractors, representing
the end of an engagement.
It may also be very sensitive, indicating when
an employee is due to be terminated.
Who can access this data depends on relationships.
For example,
HR users should be able to access this data for all users -- except
themselves.
Managers should be able to access this data for their
direct and indirect subordinates, but not themselves or other people
who do not report to them.
The Bravura Identity access control model allows organizations to define
types of relationships, such as "recipient in HR, recipient and
requester are not the same person." or "recipient reports to
requester."
Access rights are linked to types of relationships, as above.
The search engine provided through Bravura Identity respects these access
rights, to protect against data leakage.
For example, a manager
might search for all users who are scheduled for near-term
termination and will only see those who report to him -- but not
himself or others.
Using relationships makes it easy to define various user support
models.
For example, users in a country-specific help desk can
reset passwords for other users in the same country, or managers
in some regions may be allowed to reset passwords for their
direct (or indirect) reports.
Using this access control model makes it practical to manage highly
sensitive or privacy-related data using the Bravura Identity request portal
and approvals workflow.
Personal data such as date of birth, social
security number, student or employee number, enrollment and deactivation
dates, healthcare classification and more are all safe to manage using
Bravura Identity.
Hitachi ID Systems higher education customers leverage this security
model to allow users to control what, if any, of their profile
information is published to members of the campus community:
Some profiles and attributes may be made visible to certain
groups.
For example, all user profiles for students should
be visible to the admissions office; all user profiles for
staff should be visible to HR, etc.
Some profile attributes may be made visible within their
department (requester and recipient share a department affiliation).
Some profile attributes may be visible only if the requester has
set another attribute that acts as a gatekeeper.
For example,
requester can see recipient's phone number if recipient.phone-visible
is set to true, etc.
Note that access controls in Bravura Identity extend even into search
results.
For example, a competitor Identity and access management (IAM) system might not
display a user's age or contact information to another user,
but might allow for search on these or other attributes,
whereby the searcher could infer attribute values.
The
Bravura Identity access control system protects against this
type of search-and-infer attack against user privacy.
