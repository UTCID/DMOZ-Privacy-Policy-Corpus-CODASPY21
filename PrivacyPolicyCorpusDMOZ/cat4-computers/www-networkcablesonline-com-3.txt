Sales Tax
If you are shipping to Indiana you will be charged sales tax on the product and the shipping as well. This is calculated during the checkout process to see if the destination is in Indiana and will automatically add the current 7% sales tax.
Given the current changes in Internet sales tax, we will be revising our tax policy based on the new regulations for collecting sales tax for Internet orders. More to come soon.
