Privacy Policy
Expression’s web servers collect visitors’ domain names to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. Occasionally, we ask for your name and e-mail address. This information is typically used to respond to your inquiry, process an order, or provide you with access to specific account information. In order to better understand our website visitors, we occasionally conduct online surveys. We will try to let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect the survey information.
Additionally, you may decide to register with us online. If you do, we may use the information you submit, provide you with custom information about our solutions for your business needs. Occasionally, we may use “cookie” technology to provide you with pertinent information. If desirable, the browser can be set to notify you when you receive a “cookie.” A cookie is a small element of data that can be sent by our website to your browser and stored on your hard drive. This will enable us to recognize you when you return to our website.
Expression takes all commercially reasonable precautions to adequately prevent others from freely accessing the information you provide or that we compile. As you are no doubt aware, however, despite these precautions, zealous hackers may wrongfully gain access to this information. Although such unauthorized access is unlikely, our lawyers suggested that we inform you of the risk and advise you that Expression is not liable for any damages caused by such unauthorized access. Finally, our website contains links to other sites. While we try to link only to sites that share our privacy concerns, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices utilized by any other sites.
