4. Public Information and Sharing with Third Parties
Social Media Platforms and Widgets
Our website includes social media features, such as the Pinterest “Pin It" button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms such as Twitter. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We are not in control of the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves.

Our websites include links to other websites, whose privacy policies may be different from ours. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

You can read more about Google's privacy policy here.
Affiliates
We are partnered with other websites, such as theme marketplaces, and those partnerships may include affiliate links in our website. When you click on one of these affiliate or referral links, a cookie may be used to track your visit to their website from ours, and if you make a purchase on their website, we will receive a small percentage of that sale for referring you. We are also very careful about the websites we partner with, and we will only partner with websites that we like and trust. The income that we receive from these affiliate links helps us to keep the website running and maintained. Although you do have the option to adjust the settings in your browser to refuse cookies if you do not want a purchase on one of our partner websites to be affiliated with our website referral.
We are currently partnered with the following websites as affiliates: ElegantThemes.com, Envato.com, Themeforest.com, Themify.com, Themetrust.com. Each of these websites has their own privacy and cookie policies, and we recommend that you read their policies for more information about how they collect and track data.

We use Google Adsense on our website to serve ads, although we keep these ad spots at a minimum to keep the website as user-friendly as possible. Google Adsense may use tracking to display relevant ads to you, although you can disable this in Google’s “Ad Personalization" settings to prevent tracking here, and you can read more about Google’s privacy policy here here.
Where Required by Law
We may disclose necessary information to the police, law enforcement agencies, security agencies and other third parties where we are legally obligated and/or permitted to do so.
