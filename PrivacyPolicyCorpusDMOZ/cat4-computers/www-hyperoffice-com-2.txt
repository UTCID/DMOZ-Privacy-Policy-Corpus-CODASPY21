If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to you and that organization. “We” or “our” will refer to HyperOffice.You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with HyperOffice. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add or remove features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you.Account Setup and AdministrationYour Account. When you register a new Account, an Account is set up for you corresponding to the Account Type you specified (e.g., Free Trial or Regular Account), the Subscription Period, the number of Registered Users under your Account and other feature selections. You agree not to set up duplicative Free Trial Accounts to circumvent the usage restrictions. When you register an Account, you represent that you are at least 13 years old and that, to the best of your knowledge and belief, your registration information is truthful, accurate and complete.Your Password. A username and password will be assigned by us or chosen by you. You will only access and use the Services through your own Account and only during the Subscription Period. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and for activities occurring under your Account (and each Registered User associated with your Account). Be sure to change your password promptly and notify us if you believe your Account has been compromised or is being accessed by others. Users may not loan their Accounts or passwords to others.Right to Rely on Instructions. The Service may act in reliance upon any instruction, information, document, filing, name, email address or user password that meets the Service’s automated criteria or which is believed by the Service’s personnel to be genuine. For any password protected areas, the Service may assume a person entering a user name address and associated password is, in fact, that user or is authorized by that user to act on its behalf. The Service may assume the latest email addresses and registration information on file with the Service are accurate and current. When programmed to do so, the Service may take prescribed actions in the absence of receiving proper and complete contrary instructions.Prices and PaymentSome features of the Service are available for a limited Free Trial period. If you use the Services beyond the Free Trial period, applicable charges will apply. Except for the limited Free Trial features, use of our Service requires the payment of charges, which may include one-time charges and recurring subscription-based fees or other charges that may be posted.

Cancellation of the Account for payment purposes will become effective immediately prior to the next Subscription Period renewal date.If the Service is not accessible at least 99.9% of the time (as determined by the Service) for a continuous thirty (30) day period, then you may in the Service’s discretion and as your exclusive remedy be given pro-rata credit (1/30 th per day) of the monthly fee corresponding to that period, provided that you notify HyperOffice within seventy-two (72) hours of your inability to use the Service.If you received the Services through a Reseller Agreement, we reserve the right to condition access to the Services on our receipt of proper payment from the Reseller or, at our written request, from you directly.Your Content & Your PrivacyBy using our Services, you provide us with information, files and/or information, and folders that you submit to HyperOffice (collectively, your “Content”).

GDPR at HyperOffice Privacy and security have always been the foundation of our approach to product development and business, and we continuously evaluate all our practices in an effort to safeguard your information as effectively as possible. In that vein, we’re glad to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and to help our customers comply with the GDPR.What is GDPR?On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will officially take effect. For European individuals, the GDPR expands their data privacy rights and gives them more power to control their data. For companies that process the personal data of these European individuals, the GDPR requires compliance with a new set of regulations.The GDPR outlines specific requirements that these companies must satisfy, as well as specific rights that European individuals can exercise with these companies. Further information on the GDPR is available on the European Union’s official website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en.Controllers and ProcessorsThe GDPR defines and distinguishes between two types of parties and responsibilities when it comes to collecting and processing personal data: data controllers and data processors. A data controller determines the purposes and ways that personal data is processed, while a data processor is a party that process data on behalf of the controller. That means that the controller could be any company or organization. A processor could be a SaaS, IT or other company that is actually processing the data on behalf of the controller. Hyperoffice is a Data Processor. HyperOffice customers (the organizations who use HyperOffice) are Data Controllers. The controller is responsible to make sure that all processors with whom it deals will be GDPR compliant and the processors themselves must keep records of their processing activities.Data processing agreementHyperOffice offers Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) to users upon request. This DPA includes standard contractual clauses (“Model Clauses”) that are the mechanism for GDPR-compliant data transfer. To request a DPA, please email privacy@hyperoffice.com from the email address associated with your Airtable account.Features to support GDPR requirementsHyperOffice can help you meet your data portability requirements for the GDPR.
