For more details on security see Part 7, below.
As stated above, we do not generally collect any personal data directly from you, but if you contact us and we obtain your personal details from your letter, email or a contact form on one of our Sites, we may use them to respond to you. We may also use this information in the process of providing our Services to you. The other technical data referred to above is necessary for the technical operation of our Sites and will not normally be used in any way to personally identify you.
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements).
We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes other than where it is required to
deliver Services or provide information that you have requested from us (for example, to training venues that require names of delegates and other personal information such as dietary requirements)
partners that we work with to provide our Services
meet our obligations to your employer (for example, if they are paying for training that you attend, and they request course attendance statistics and copies of your evaluations)

We will store most of your personal data in the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the Data Protection Legislation.
For some of our Services, we may store some or all of your personal data in, countries outside of the EEA. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These measures include transferring your personal data to third parties who are located in a country which the European Commission has determined has data protection laws that are at least as protective as those in Europe, and transferring your personal data to third parties who have entered into standard contractual clauses with us. For more information about these safeguards please contact us using the contact details provided below.
Personal data security is essential to us, and to protect personal data, we take the following measures:
limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality;
procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner s Office where we are legally required to do so.
