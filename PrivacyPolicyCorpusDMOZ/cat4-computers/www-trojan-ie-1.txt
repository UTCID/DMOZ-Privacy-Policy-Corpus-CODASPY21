We review this Privacy Statement regularly. Occasionally we may need to make changes or additions to this Statement that may affect how we handle your data.   We will indicate on this page when the Privacy Statement has changed so please refer to this link for the latest version.
This Privacy Statement was last reviewed and updated in January 2018.
1. What information will Trojan IT collect?
During our relationship with you, we may collect personal information, such as your name, address, telephone, email, IP address and other contact details, and any other information relating to you which you may provide.

Your personal information may be processed, by Trojan IT, for purposes including: (i) administering our relationship with you; (ii) providing any goods, services or information you have requested; (iii) providing you with information about our products and services; and (iv) for auditing usage of the site.
The transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and, as such, is at your own risk.

The processing of personal data for marketing purposes is carried out in line with legislation and the Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003 ("The Acts") and Statutory Instrument Number 336 of 2011 European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011 ("SI 336/2011"). Occasionally, we may contact you with information about other Trojan IT products and services which we think may be of interest to you. However, we will only do so when you have given your prior consent to being contacted in this way and/or subject to relevant legal requirements.
Trojan IT occasionally may email marketing information to subscribers on their database in accordance with The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). All recipients of this material can unsubscribe using the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of all marketing emails received.
