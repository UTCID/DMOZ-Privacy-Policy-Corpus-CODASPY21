How ClearStar Uses and Collects Information in its Businesses
A number of services offered by ClearStar are Consumer Reports (“Consumer Reports”), as the term is defined under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and when providing Consumer Reports to its Clients, ClearStar acts as a Consumer Reporting Agency (“CRA”) as the term is defined under the FCRA, operating in accordance with the requirements of the FCRA. The FCRA establishes the following principles for all CRAs:
Privacy: Information about you may only be furnished to third-parties that have a permissible purpose to request such information. In general, these deal with credit, employment, insurance, rental or banking transactions initiated by you, or where the object is to make a firm offer to you. CRAs must credential their clients to make certain that they have a permissible purpose to receive the requested information.
Access: Consumers may receive a copy of information the CRA maintains about them. Such reports can be obtained nationally free of charge once per 12 months, twice in some states, or for a reasonable fee for additional disclosures. Please contact ClearStar at Privacy@ClearStar.net or call toll free +1-678-999-8048 if you need more information.
Accuracy: CRAs must follow reasonable procedures to assure accuracy of the information they maintain and/or furnish. When you obtain a copy of your information, you have a right to dispute and have the information reinvestigated and corrected in the CRAs database.
Fairness: Information is obtained from various sources including public records sources. However, certain information over a specified time period may not be reported.
Accountability: The Federal Trade Commission is in charge with overseeing the operations of CRAs that provide consumer reports for employment and residential screening purposes and enforcing the FCRA requirements.
When ClearStar provides Consumer Reports on U.S. residents, it is subject to the FCRA and operates within FCRA framework. If you would like to obtain a report about the information ClearStar maintains about you, please call toll free +1-678-999-8048 or email Privacy@ClearStar.net.

ClearStar uses this information to fulfill background screening requests by customers, which may be employers, other background screening companies, housing providers, and the data subject. ClearStar’s client is required to have obtained written consent from the data subject for this collection. ClearStar maintains written agreements for services with its clients.

More information regarding the nature and scope of ClearStar’s data processing is available by contacting ClearStar in writing or by e-mail at the addresses listed on the Contact Us page or by writing to the contact listed below.
2. Choice
The information obtained by ClearStar is only used for the original purpose to which the data subject has consented, unless a new consent is obtained.

In such case, ClearStar will make every attempt to stop the processing as quickly as possible.
3. Accountability for Onward Transfer
ClearStar may engage agents to perform functions on our behalf, in order to provide services requested by customers or data subjects. ClearStar enters into service agreements with these agents and requires that the companies acting on ClearStar’s behalf abide by the ClearStar privacy policy and institute safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your information. In cases of onward transfer to agents of data of EU, UK, or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, ClearStar is potentially liable.
ClearStar may disclose EU, UK, or Swiss Personal Data to clients, or their agents who enter into a written agreement with ClearStar, in which the client agrees to comply with the FCRA, if applicable. These ClearStar customers are contractually required to provide a legally compliant Notice to their data subjects prior to submitting screening requests to ClearStar.
4. Security
ClearStar takes reasonable procedures to protect EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
5. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
The information obtained by ClearStar is only used for the original purpose to which the data subject has consented or the legal grounds for processing allow this access, unless a new consent is obtained or another legal ground for processing has been met. ClearStar processes EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it has been collected (as identified in the Notice section above) or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, ClearStar takes reasonable steps to ensure that EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data collected are comprehensive, complete, current, and reliable for their intended use.
6. Access
A data subject, whose information is or was processed by ClearStar under the Privacy Shield, has the right to access all personal data collected and maintained about him or her by contacting us directly at Privacy@ClearStar.net. ClearStar affords the data subject a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete information that is incomprehensive or incomplete, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

ClearStar reserves the right to engage in reasonable efforts to confirm the identity of the individual requesting their personal data.
