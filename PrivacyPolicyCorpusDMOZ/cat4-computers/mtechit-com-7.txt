Privacy Protection
Privacy Protection
Protect the privacy of users whose login sessions were recorded.
Request/approval for playback and text input censorship
Session monitoring can have serious implications on user privacy and
so should be implemented with great care.
The session monitoring
infrastructure is subject to strict access control rules and workflow
processes.
For example, an auditor must first request the right
to perform a given search through session data.
If approved, he can
execute the search and may find sessions of interest.
The auditor
must then request the right to playback selected sessions.
Only if
this second request is approved can the auditor retrieve session data.
Of course, all such requests and searches this is indelibly logged.
Another measure used to protect user privacy in Hitachi ID Bravura Privilege is a
pattern-matching censorship process.
Hitachi ID Systems customers are encouraged
to define regular expression patterns, matching passwords,
social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers,
etc.
A process on the Bravura Privilege server post-processes keystroke
and keyword data captured by the session monitor, searching for
matches for these patterns.
Matches are deleted from the keystroke
and keyword database.
Real time surveillance
Bravura Privilege can monitor user activity, including video capture and
keylogging.
This data can be replayed both in real time (one
user watching another's current activity) or later, subject to
request/approval workflows and privacy protection measures.
Bravura Privilege supports but Hitachi ID does not recommend real time session
surveillance (one user watching another):
If screen sharing is intended to be interactive, there are already
off-the-shelf solutions that Hitachi ID customer almost certainly uses, such as
WebEx.
The added value of doing this through Bravura Privilege is minimal.
If session viewing is intended to not be evident -- i.e., a watcher
and an unaware user being watched -- then there is significant
opportunity for privacy compromise.
Consider a user, being
watched, who takes a coffee break and does some personal
banking, while being watched.
Hitachi ID customer legal would almost
certainly forbid such activity.
There are a range of views among vendors in the marketplace regarding
how to approach session monitoring.
At one end of the spectrum are
vendors who encourage non-apparent session viewing, up to and including
real time surveillance.
This viewpoint ignores the risk of privacy
compromise and the possibility of corporate legal liability as a result.
At the other end of the spectrum are vendors who value privacy first
and surveillance second.
Hitachi ID is firmly on this privacy-first end
of the spectrum.
