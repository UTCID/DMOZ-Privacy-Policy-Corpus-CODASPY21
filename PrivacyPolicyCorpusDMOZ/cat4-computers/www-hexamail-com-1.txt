Antispam server protection
Hexamail Guard provides the most comprehensive set of antispam, antiphishing and antivirus features of any server based email gateway software.
This provides effective elimination of email threats before they penetrate your organization and allows you to decide on the techniques that are
best suited to your email system.
Many spamblockers simply rely on central "finger print" files or lists of IP addresses to block. Often this approach fails to prevent initial outbreaks of new types of spam or spam from new sources.
Hexamail employs additional powerful content inspection techniques that read the actual email, ensuring even spam from new IP addresses, or of an entirely new nature is blocked.
You can enable Bayesian analysis, DNS based blocklists, keywords and expression matching, sender blacklisting, whitelisting, challenge-response
for blocked email, email tagging, email deletion or any combination of the techniques you wish!

of virus, worms, scripts and other malicious content. Hexamail can scan with numerous antivirus engines if installed.
Hexamail with antivirus provides customers with total email protection.
Exchange Integration
Hexamail Guard integrates automatically and seamlessly with all versions of Exchange on-premises providing straightforward integration and easy administration.
Hexamail can integrate with Exchange 2016, 2013, 2010, 2007, 2003, 2000, or 5.5 on the same machine or on a separate server.
SPF Verification
SPF (Sender Policy Framework) fully supported. SPF ensures that email is only accepted if it came from the servers designated by the sending domain's policy.
This means you can verify the sender is legitimately allowed to send email from the domain. In particular this can help reduce Phishing, where senders spoof email from another domain.
DKIM Verification
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) checks are performed on any DKIM signed email.
This verifies the sender is allowed to send email from the domain specified. It also verifies that the email has not been tampered with or forged.
In particular this can help reduce phishing, where senders spoof email from another domain.
SURBL Support
SURBL is an RBL designed to be used to block or tag spam based on URIs (usually their domain names) contained within the message body.
It is not a conventional RBL in that it's not intended to block the source of spam messages. Instead, SURBL can be used to block spams based on their message content.

Bayesian matching
Bayesian pattern matching is used to analyze the entire content of incoming email: this prevents the mistakes made by relying on single keywords or rules
whilst ensuring the filters are robust to subtle changes in language, deliberate misspellings and tricks typical in spam. This allows Hexamail software to provide unrivalled accuracy
and reliability when detecting spam.
Neural sender matching
Cutting-edge neural network technology is used to identify suspicious sender addresses with high accuracy and incredible performance. Neural sender matching enables high volumes of email
to be checked in the shortest possible time.
Automatic Whitelists
Hexamail provides support for multiple sender and recipient white lists. The white list can be imported, manually created or automatically
created and kept up to date through analysis of outgoing email traffic. Domain whitelisting is also possible.
Challenge Response
With Hexamail Guard you can optionally enable Challenge-Response features to allow sender verification email to be sent out. Senders can then verify themselves to have their email accepted and whitelist their address to allow all future email to pass through unfiltered.
Image Analysis
Hexamail Guard not only analyses the text of email but also any embedded images, using the structure of the images to determine whether an email is SPAM or not. Increasingly SPAM email consists entirely of images, and so this technique
is essential for effective blocking.
Content and Header checks
Hexamail supports multiple sophisticated header, subject and content checks with configurable rules, keyword filtering
and phrase matching lists that can be	maintained by the administrator.
POP3 Connector
Hexamail can download all your user's POP3 accounts, strip out the SPAM and reroute the email to their corporate mailbox or other email address.
Anti phishing
Hexamail features built in anti-phishing protection by recognizing spoofed email, web links and requests for account details.
Greylisting
Configurable greylisting (or graylisting) support allow rejection of unknown senders and IPs
DNS Blacklists
Hexamail supports any third party DNS based blacklists (DNS BL or real time black hole lists).
These databases can be used to block all email from known SPAM sending email servers and open relays.
Choose what to do with matching IP addresses, Reject, Block, Mark or Weight.
Hexamail Guard supports all real-time blacklist services including:
list.dsbl.org,
blackholes.intersil.net,

multi.surbl.org,
Customized lists can also be imported or new IP addresses added in a single click from the spam quarantine.
URL DNS checking
URLs contained in the content of email are checked against configurable DNS based databases of known spam hosts. Email is blocked if it contains URLs hosted on webservers known to belong to spammers.
RHSBL checking
Right-Hand-Side blacklist checking againt configurable DNS based databases of known spam domains.
Email is blocked if the sender is from a domain known to belong to spammers.
SBS Integration
Hexamail Guard integrates automatically and seamlessly with all versions of Small Business Server providing straightforward integration and easy administration.
Hexamail can integrate with SBS 2003, SBS 2008 and SBS 2011 either on the same machine as SBS or on a separate server if required.
Windows Essentials
Hexamail Guard integrates automatically and seamlessly with all versions of Windows Server Essentials providing straightforward integration and easy administration.
Hexamail can integrate on the same machine as Windows Server Essentials or on a separate server if required.
Link Interception
Link Interception dynamically rewrites email links to redirect users to a warning page if they click links in email that arrives from external unknown senders.
This can be used to warn the user that they may be visiting a malicious site and to be aware of phishing and spear-phishing attempts.
Sender Tagging
Email from external unknown senders can be tagged in the subject or content to alert users to email from external or previously unknown sender addresses.
Hexamial Flow email client already highlights this and alerts users, but if your inferior email client does not already highlight this this feature can be used to add this functionality
to your email system.
Spam Quarantine
SPAM detected by Hexamail can be stored in a quarantine for later review. The quarantine allows the administrator to quickly review and send on or delete large numbers of email with a single click.
A special viewing window allows the safe viewing of any suspect email without inadvertently triggering worms, virus or pop ups.
Email Privacy Guaranteed
Unlike many antispam solutions, Hexamail does not send your email to the cloud for processing. Email stays on your network which guarantees privacy of your communications,
prevents snooping and industrial espionage, and reduces the risk of hacking.
Mark, delete or forward spam
Mark SPAM subject lines, delete SPAM over a specified match confidence or forward to user's spam folder, public folder or any other email account.
User SPAM review
The administrator can optionally allow some or all users to review their own quarantined SPAM via a web based interface.
Users are automatically alerted to new email arriving in their quarantine and can empty their quarantine with a single click from the alert email.
Alternatively they can login to a secure web interface to selectively delete SPAM email and accept legitimate email.
Customizable Web Interface
The web based interface is fully customizable through the built in HTML template manager and editor.
Supports all SMTP servers

Unrivaled ease of use
Hexamail is dedicated to changing the way business software works: making it easy and productive to use. This reduces configuration mistakes and saves you time and
money.
Server based anti-spam
For a corporate anti-spam policy to be successful it must be enforced at the server level removing the need for client-side installs and end-user training.
Not only does this ensure the most straightforward maintenance but also ensures the solution is as cost-effective as possible to deploy.
Automatic Internet updates
SPAM and virus adapt and change every day. Any system to detect and eliminate unsolicited email and virus must be kept up to date.
Hexamail's software automatically updates itself over the Internet to ensure the latest SPAM and virus can be stopped.

SPAM Blocking
Hexamail's server antispam filter eliminates the cost, time and frustration your workers spend on unsolicited email (junk/spam) by blocking the majority of spam email before
they ever reach your mailserver.
Hexamail's multilayered antispam filtering ensures the best of breed techniques are used to provide total protection from all email bourne threats including spam, malware, spoofing, phishing and virus.
Automatic built in heuristics are combined with admin and user configurable rules and optional features such as greylisting and challenge response to allow you to tailor your spam solution to your exact needs.
Unlike the majority of other antispam solutions, Hexamail is a server software solution that runs on your network so your email is never sent to the cloud
or any third party servers for analysis. This ensures your privacy is guaranteed, eliminates any additional latency in receiving email and prevents your
email being dependent on a third party service that can suffer downtime or hacking.

Router
Incoming emails can place a huge burden on the nominated recipient. Often several email addresses are provided publicly for information, questions and other telemarketing activities. More often than not emails arrive to all addresses about a diversity of subjects, with little relationship between the email address and the subject matter. For example, a company-wide email address such as mail@yourcompany.com will receive speculative employment queries, requests for information, invitations to tender, unsolicited junk mail, technical support questions etc. etc.
Having a single nominated recipient quickly results in the recipient becoming over-burdened with email. Studies show that having multiple recipients results in no one giving the incoming message stream the required attention.
The solution? Intelligently route each incoming mail based on the nature of the subject, content, and any attachment to the most suitable respondent recipient.
Routing uses rules concerning the subject line, contents, and previous message chain to ensure that the correct recipient is initially identified and then continues the correspondence when required.

Attachments
The attachment module automatically archives attachments from all email.
It also optionally removes the attachment and replaces it with a link allowing the attachment to be served more efficiently from a webserver.
This prevents users having to download attachments they don't need or wish to refer to later.
Attachments are automatically deduplicated if sent to multiple recipients: you only need store one copy of each file received or sent!
Secure
You can view and control attachments using powerful queries. This allows you to remove any attachments accidentally sent to external recipients,
or dangerous or time-wasting attachments sent to your internal users.

Secure
Hexamail Secure module provides a centralized automatic email security solution.
It enables signing, verification, encryption, decryption using PKI X509 certificates and also Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) functions on outbound email.
PKI certificates are easily managed and multiple security policy rules can be setup to dictate which email is signed, encrypted, decrypted and verified.
Email security failures can be quarantined for administrator inspection.
DKIM is used to sign email from your domain so that the recipient knows that they have not been spoofed.
Hexamail helps you manage your DKIM signing public/private key pairs and the required DNS entries for DKIM.
Anti Spoofing
Removes the ability of malicious parties to spoof email from your domain using Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
Better Delivery
DKIM ensures improved delivery rates of email to many domains such as Yahoo, Gmail, AOL
End-2-End Encryption
Email encryption with PKI (SMIME) allows for end to end email security on Blackberry, Android and iPhone devices and desktop email clients.
This prevents email interception
Verification
All incoming email can automatically be verified ensuring your users can have peace of mind when receiving signed email
Simple to deploy
Enable the secure module, install any required email certificates and the deployment is complete!
Easy to use
Removes the complexity of encrypted and signed email from the users and allows the company to specify central security policies
Signing
PKI SMIME signing allows all your outbound email to be securely signed using PKI email signing certificates (X509)
Verification
PKI SMIME verification allows you to configure central policies for email signature verification for inbound email
Automatically quarantine email that fails verification, as it may be spoofed.
Encryption
PKI SMIME encryption allows you to encrypt outbound email using centrally managed policies and certificates
Decryption
PKI SMIME decryption allows you to configure a single central policy to automatically decrypt inbound email
Domain Keys Identified Mail
DKIM signing allows Domain Keys Identified Mail signatures to be automatically added to all outbound email from your server.
These signatures guarantee to the next server that the email has not been tampered with and when combined with Author Domain Signing Practices
guarantees that the message originates from your email domains
Automatic Key Creation
Hexamail automatically creates the required crytopgraphic public/private key pairs required for DKIM signing. The private key is held securely on your server
DKIM Selector Management
DKIM allows for multiple different selectors (or key pairs) to be used for signing. Hexamail manages these and automatically signs email with the appropriate
selector
DNS Entry Generation
The Secure module automatically generates the DNS entries required for the DKIM signature verification process, allowing recipient servers
to verify your email signatures. Simply cut and paste the generated DKIM DNS entries into your DNS management interface as a TXT record
ADSP support

Archiver
Hexamail Archiver module provides is a centralized automatic email archiving solution.
Highly efficient full-text indexing and compression algorithms ensure that the most scalable
and high performance email archive is generated entirely automatically from all of your email.
Hexamail's email archive software leverages state of the art indexing and compression technology to create the most compact
and high performance index of email data. Inferior solutions often simply push emails to relational databases or worse, file systems.
Such systems suffer from poor scalability, lengthy query/discovery times and extremely high storage requirements: often requiring
more space for the archive than the original emails!
Compliance
Store 100% of your email in full original MIME format
Discovery
Use the live search facilities to allow users to access their old email
Scalable
Store many years of email in a single server
Compressed
Unique MIME compression algorithms ensure most compact storage
Full Text

High speed archiving
Native high-performance C++ archiving code ensures that emails are archived and indexed in realtime. The unsurpassed performance allows the archive to be used live by end-users to retrieve
old, deleted, or difficult to find emails from a web-interface.
Massively Scalable
Archiving of 100s of millions of emails in a single archiver is possible, allowing many years of emails to be
archived on a single server or drive.
Low Storage Requirements
All email content (MIME) is retained compressed, allowing accurate records to be retained while minimizing storage. Emails are automatically deduplicated.
Save costs of storages devices, upgrading servers and backup time and facilities.
Fulltext search
Full-text indexing automatically takes place on archiving.
This allows your valuable resource of archived emails to be leveraged for knowledge management,
auditing and discovery within your organization.
Genuine Archiving
Some inferior archiving solutions simply push email content into a relational database.
This can be costly in database licenses, slow to retrieve email and extremely demanding of disk space and other machine resources.
Be sure to check the licensing implications and costs of such systems before purchase. Hexamail is a complete solution requiring
no third party database licenses.
Secure
Archiving takes place on your servers, within your network.
Sensitive emails need never leave your organization, eliminating trust, hacking, or security breach
concerns typical of third party service based archive solutions providers.
Active Directory Integration
Active Directory integration allows automatic import of your users and restriction of their access to only their emails
SSL
Full secure SSL access to web based knowledge management, discovery and search interfaces.
Sources
The Archiver module can index email from almost any source including Exchange, maildir, mbox, hMail, iMail, MDaemon, Hexamail, POP3, SMTP, and PST
Exchange 2000-2013
Index email directly from Exchange 2000 onwards
PST
Index any PST files from Outlook clients or Exchange server
Long term retention
Content can be retained for periods matching typical regulatory requirements such as Sarbanes Oxley, European Union ISP Communications Data retention, SEC Rules, NASD, HIPAA and Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.
Regulatory Adherence
Full MIME storage ensures your chosen email archive solution adheres to all regulations now and in future.
Regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley can be costly to implement, Hexamail Vault eliminates the cost for archiving email in a compliant way.
Backup
A unique index design allows email content to be backed up and removed from the live server to secure/offsite backup facilities. The fulltext index remembers which emails were in which backup files and allows fulltext search even over email removed from the server.
Automated Export
Automated export features allow all email matching specific complex criteria to be exported to directories or zip files for litigation or auditing purposes.
Fulltext Search
Full-text indexing automatically takes place on archiving. This allows your valuable resource of archived emails to be leveraged for knowledge management, auditing and discovery within your organization.
Live Access
Live-access allows your end-users to access the archive through a web-interface and retrieve email they may have deleted or lost in their inbox. This simultaneously ensure valuable knowledge is never lost from your organization, can be quickly retrieved, and users reduces user inbox storage requirements.
