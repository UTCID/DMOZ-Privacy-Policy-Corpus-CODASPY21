We do not reveal personal information about you to third-parties unless: (i) you request or authorize; (ii) in connection with a company-sponsored event or conference; (iii) the information is provided to comply with the law, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights or the rights of others; (iv) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (iv) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (v) is otherwise legally permissible to do so. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and website visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated information to our affiliates, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
Our Security Measures to Protect Information
Our company uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving data exchanged between our company and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to help protect information under our control from the risk of accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. If this website contains links to other sites, our company is not responsible for the security practices or the content of such sites.
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Links
Our company websites may use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements and web usage. This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third parties to collect that information.
Cookies. Many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences http://levitrastore.net/. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer. All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.
Web Beacons. Our company and third parties may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our company’s cookie requirements.
Links. We may create links to other web sites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by our company may have links leading to our site. Our company cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy practices of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose any personal information to others.
Personal Information Retention
We will retain any personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the business purpose it was collected. We will also retain and use your personal information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
International Transfers of Personal Information
Information collected from you may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which our company or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by accessing our sites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

Reasonable access to your personal information may be provided at no cost upon request made to our company at the contact information provided below. If access cannot be provided within that time frame, our company will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided.
