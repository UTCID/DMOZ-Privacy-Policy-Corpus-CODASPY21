Cookie Policy
Metaswitch Networks wants its websites to be simple, useful and accessible. This sometimes involves putting information on the device that you use to access our websites, for example your computer or mobile phone. This includes small files called cookies.
What we use cookies for
We use cookies to improve our websites for you. For example, we use cookies to:
Recognize that you may have given a username and password to log in to one of our services so that you don’t need to do it for every web page that you visit.
Remember any personal preferences that you may tell us about.
Remember certain actions that you may have taken. For example, if you have already seen a particular feature banner, our website will use a cookie to remember this and show you a different one next time.
Ensure a high quality of service when you view digital media, such as videos.
Measure how many people visit our websites, to help us understand how our users interact with our websites so that we can make them better.
Removing or blocking cookies
If you do not want to have cookies placed on your device, you can remove any existing cookies and block new cookies from being put on your device. To learn more about how to remove or block cookies in your web browser, visit www.aboutcookies.org, read the Help text in your web browser, or read the instructions for your mobile device.
Please note that blocking cookies might degrade your experience or prevent you from using some features on our websites. For example, if you block cookies our websites might not remember any personal preferences you set and you might not be able to log in to any user accounts that you have set up.
Types of cookies
Our websites use two types of cookie.
First party cookies: these are our own cookies, controlled by us and used to support the essential infrastructure and user experience of our websites.
Third party cookies: these are cookies found in other companies’ internet tools which we are using to enhance our websites. For example, our websites use cookies provided by Google Analytics.
