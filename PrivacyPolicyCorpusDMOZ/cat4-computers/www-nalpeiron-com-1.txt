14. GENERAL TERMS
14.1 The Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and Nalpeiron relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms.

You must not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use Nalpeiron or third-party products or services.
14.2 You agree that any material breach of Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Nalpeiron for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Nalpeiron will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Nalpeiron seeks such an injunction.
14.3 U.S. law governs any action related to the Terms and/or Your use of the Website.

U.S. or your local laws; (b) not use Services, Content, or direct product from this Website to design, develop or produce missile, chemical/biological, or nuclear weaponry; and (c) not provide Services, Content, or direct product from this Website to prohibited countries and entities identified in the
U.S. export regulations.
14.5 Rights and obligations under the Terms which by their nature should survive will remain in full effect after termination or expiration of the Terms.
14.6 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
