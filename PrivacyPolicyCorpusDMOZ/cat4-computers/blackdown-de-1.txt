Google SSL Search Plug-In for Firefox
As of today Google finally supports searching over SSL.
Expectedly, you can use it via https://www.google.com/.
Firefox’s built-in search capabilities still use the unencrypted search, though.
To remedy this I built an OpenSearch plug-in which makes Firefox use the HTTPS-based search:
Install Google Secure Search Plug-In

Stop Facebook From Tracking You on Third-Party Sites
If you are using Firefox with the Adblock Plus add-on, it is quite easy to stop Facebook from tracking you on third-party sites via its Facebook Connect program or by other means.
Just add these four rules to Adblock Plus:
||facebook.com$third-party
||facebook.net$domain=~facebook.com,third-party
||fbcdn.com$domain=~facebook.com,third-party
||fbcdn.net$domain=~facebook.com,third-party
Instead of adding the rules manually, you can subscribe to this Adblock Plus filter subscription: Facebook Connect Opt-Out.
