Consumers controlling cookies
JupiterResearch has some surprising findings regarding cookies.
Based on a survey of 2,337 U.S. respondents, the study finds that 17 percent of Internet users delete cookies on a weekly basis. Approximately 12 percent do so on a monthly basis, and 10 percent make it a daily habit.
"For some reason, consumers have identified cookies incorrectly as spyware," he added. "Consumers don't understand what cookies do."
The report found 28 percent of Internet users are selectively rejecting third party cookies, such as those placed by online ad networks. One company researchers interviewed said the number of visitors blocking third-party cookies has increased from less than three percent in January 2003 to 14 percent of visitors in January 2005. Peterson suggested site owners should turn instead to first-party cookies as a standard.
I personally have trouble believing that people ACTUALLY do this.
I would like to see more data from online sources that rely on cookies.
JupiterResearch has recognized this issue, and over at their blogs, analyst David Schatsky says that they talked to a number of web operators that corroborated this information.

New Outlook to give spammers the bootNew Outlook to give spammers the bootWhen content is downloaded in spam e-mail it can act as what is known as a "Web beacon," telling the sender that the e-mail address is in fact valid, a technique used by spammers. Viewing the message in a preview pane without opening it is enough to trigger the Web beacon, analysts said. The beacon can lead to more unwanted mail from the original sender and, potentially, from other spammers who have access to the same mailing list.Posted by rshah on November 01, 2002| Comments (0)

A simple technique for accessing Microsoft's free e-mail service without a password is in the wild and apparently being exploited. The trick involves capturing a copy of the victim's browser cookies file. Once the perpetrator gains two key Hotmail cookies, there's no way to lock him out because at Hotmail, cookies trump even passwords.Posted by rshah on April 26, 2002| Comments (0)
Is your e-mail watching you?Is your e-mail watching you?Web sites have long planted bits of code called "cookies" on consumers' hard drives to tailor Internet pages for returning visitors and better target ads. Now, enhanced messages that share the look and feel of Web pages are being used to deliver the same bits of code through e-mail, in many cases without regard for safeguards that have been developed to protect consumer privacy on the Web.Posted by rshah on April 08, 2002| Comments (0)

The cookie fussThe cookie fussIt's relatively simple for Web site designers to build their applications to work perfectly well with browsers that don't accept cookies; doing so would avoid a technology that many consumers either don't trust or don't understand. Applications can pass state identifiers in URLs or in hidden form fields and thus avoid cookies altogether. We advocate that Web sites switch to URL state encoding and fully disclose what user information is collected at their sites.Posted by rshah on June 27, 2001| Comments (0)

Technique to Manage Cookies Using OperaTechnique to Manage Cookies Using OperaOpera 5.02 has a great feature called "throw away new cookies on exit".
It will accept all cookies, but when you exit it tosses them.
So, you set up cookies for all the sites you want them for (like slashdot), exit opera (it only saves cookies on exit), check them using Opera File Explorer (see below), then start it back up and check off the "throw away new cookies on exit" option under File~~Preferences~~Security.Posted by rshah on March 22, 2001| Comments (0)
