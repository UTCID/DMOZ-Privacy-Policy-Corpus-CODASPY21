Introduction
This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") governs the customer's use of business voice services provided by Shaw Business (the "Service" or "Services") and any devices and/or equipment used to support the Service, including without limitation, any equipment or software used in conjunction with the Service which is loaned to customer from SB for customer's use solely in connection with the Service (collectively, the "Equipment"). SB may amend this AUP from time to time and will update the revision date on the AUP posted on line atwww.shaw.ca/sbsto indicate when changes have been made. All changes will take effect within 30 days of the date of being posted. CUSTOMER'S CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER CHANGES ARE POSTED WILL BE DEEMED ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDED AUP.
Uses and Restrictions
Customer may only use the Service from customer's equipment located at customer's service location as specified in the applicable service appendix signed by customer and SB. The Services are only to be used for normal business calling purposes such as person to person conversations or voice messages. Customer is solely responsible for use of the Service provided to it by SB, regardless if such use occurred without the customer's consent or knowledge. Customer may not use the Service for any applications which exceed the network resources for which customer has contracted for under the applicable Service Appendix by more than 120% The Service may not be used for any activity that violates any local, provincial, federal, international or other applicable law or regulation.

CUSTOMER IS REQUIRED TO CONTACT SB BEFORE USING ANY MEDICAL MONITORING DEVICES THROUGH THE SERVICE.
Service Interruptions

Most importantly, some equipment may not operate if there is a power failure, resulting in customer losing the ability to use the Service, including access to 9-1-1 emergency services until the power is restored. A power failure or disruption in the Service may require SB to reset or reconfigure the Equipment prior to customer being able to utilize the Service.
