Terms of Use
LAST UPDATED: AUGUST 16, 2011
These Terms of Use ("TOU") constitute a binding agreement between you, the customer or end user, and DomainPeople, Inc. (“DomainPeople”) with respect to your use of the services provided by DomainPeople.
All users of DomainPeople’s services, and all customers upon signing up for DomainPeople’s services, agree to comply with DomainPeople’s Terms of Use ("TOU"). The spirit of the TOU is to ensure customers are using DomainPeople’s services with due regard to the rights of other Internet users and in conformity with the requirements of DomainPeople’s network environment. The TOU are not exhaustive and DomainPeople reserves the right to add, delete, or modify any provision of its TOU at any time without notice, effective upon the posting of the modified TOU to www.domainpeople.com (or such other URL as DomainPeople may designate from time to time). Any complaints about a customer's violation of the TOU should be sent to abuse@domainpeople.com. Except when expressly agreed to the contrary in writing by an authorized representative of DomainPeople, this TOU supersedes any other agreement with DomainPeople, whether written, oral, by conduct, or otherwise.
A. Web Hosting & Ecommerce Customer Restrictions
B. Dedicated Server Customer Restrictions
C. All Customer Terms of Use
D. Copyright Violations and Abuse
E. All Customer Billing Policy
A. WEB HOSTING & ECOMMERCE CUSTOMER RESTRICTIONS
The following Terms of Use apply only to DomainPeople’s Web Hosting and Ecommerce customers, and supplement the terms in sections C, D, and E that apply to all DomainPeople customers:
SERVER RESOURCES
Any website that uses a high amount of server resources (such as, but not limited to, CPU time, memory usage, and network resources) will be given the option to either pay additional fees (which will depend on the resources required), reduce the resources used to an acceptable level, or upgrade its service to a Dedicated Server plan. DomainPeople will be the sole arbiter of what is considered to be a high server usage level. All Web Hosting and Ecommerce accounts come with a limit of 5,000 files per account. Each block of 5,000 files after the initial 5,000 will incur an additional charge of US$9.95/month. Any Web Hosting and Ecommerce account deemed to be adversely affecting server performance or network integrity will be shut down without prior notice.
CGI SCRIPTS
Any scripts that pose a potential security risk or are deemed to be adversely affecting server performance or network integrity will be shut down or will be automatically removed without prior notice. DomainPeople does not permit CGI script sharing with domains not hosted by DomainPeople or any scripts that may be abused for UCE purposes.
CHAT ROOMS
DomainPeople does not allow Web Hosting and Ecommerce customers to install their own chat rooms. Chat rooms tend to require significant system resources and therefore cannot be permitted as an account option. However, for a small charge, DomainPeople provides Java chat rooms that meet most users' needs and run without hindering system performance.
BACKGROUND RUNNING PROGRAMS AND CRON JOBS
DomainPeople may allow programs to run in the background. These programs will be considered on an individual basis and Web Hosting and Ecommerce customers will incur extra charges based on system resources used and operational maintenance needed. If you wish to run background programs please contact DomainPeople Support by logging into your account at https://sitecontrol.domainpeople.com and clicking on Contact Us.
IRC
DomainPeople does not allow IRC or IRC bots to be operated by Web Hosting and Ecommerce customers.
SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION
DomainPeople’s Web Hosting and Ecommerce accounts are not configured for the purposes of distributing software and/or multimedia products. If you wish to distribute software and/or multimedia files, please contact DomainPeople at http://www.domainpeople.com/contact/ to make special arrangements.
MULTIMEDIA FILES
Multimedia files are defined as any graphics, audio, and video files. DomainPeople Web Hosting and Ecommerce accounts are not to be used for the purposes of distributing and storing unusual amounts of multimedia files. Any website whose disk space usage for storing multimedia files exceeds 70% of its total usage, in terms of total size or number of files, will be considered to be using an unusual amount of multimedia files.
DATABASES
Any database stored on DomainPeople’s Web Hosting and Ecommerce servers will be limited in size to 10% of the total disk space allotted for that particular domain's plan/Web hosting account.
B. DEDICATED SERVER CUSTOMER RESTRICTIONS
The following Terms of Use apply only to DomainPeople’s Dedicated Server customers, and supplement the terms in sections C, D and E that apply to all DomainPeople customers:
CUSTOMER SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES
You are solely responsible for any breaches of security affecting servers under or associated with your account. If your server is involved in an attack on another server or system, it will be shut down and an immediate investigation will be launched to determine the cause/source of the attack. In such event, you are responsible for the cost to rectify any damage done to your server and any other requirement affected by the security breach.
IRC
DomainPeople allows Dedicated Server customers the use of IRC inside the DomainPeople network as long as the use of IRC on a DomainPeople server does not violate any of the other terms of these TOU. As a policy, DomainPeople will not provide vanity IRC reverse DNS records. To enforce this policy DomainPeople does not turn the reverse address of IPs over to the customer. Authority over this information remains with DomainPeople.
BILLING FOR NETWORK RESOURCES
You understand that you are responsible for paying for any network resources that are used to connect your server to the Internet. You may request that your server be disconnected from the Internet, but you will still be responsible for paying for any network resources used up to the point of suspension or cancellation.

DomainPeople reserves the right to suspend and/or cancel service with any customer who uses the DomainPeople network in such a way that adversely affects other DomainPeople customers. While DomainPeople may monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily, as a general practice, DomainPeople does not monitor its customers' communications or activities to determine whether they are in compliance with the TOU. However, when DomainPeople becomes aware of any violation of the TOU or other user agreements, DomainPeople may take any action to stop or correct such violation, including, but not limited to, denying you access to DomainPeople’s services and equipment or to the Internet. In addition, DomainPeople reserves the right to take action against you or your end user because of the activities of such end user. DomainPeople anticipates that if you are a customer who offers Internet services you will cooperate with DomainPeople in any corrective or preventive action that DomainPeople deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of DomainPeople policy and DomainPeople reserves the right to take any such action even though such action may affect your other end users.

DomainPeople reserves the right to remove any account without prior notice and to refuse service to anyone at any time. When DomainPeople becomes aware of an alleged violation of its TOU, DomainPeople will initiate an investigation. During the investigation, DomainPeople may restrict your access in order to prevent further potentially unauthorized activity.

disruptive use of the Internet. DomainPeople does not issue credits for outages incurred through service disablement resulting from TOU violations.

If you provide DomainPeople your credit card information, you authorize DomainPeople to automatically charge your credit or debit card for charges that apply to your account. Recurring charges will be posted to your credit card until such time that you cancel your account in accordance with DomainPeople’s Billing Policy in the TOU. Charges subsequent to your initial order will accumulate in your account until such charges exceed $9.95. DomainPeople will then automatically charge your credit card on the next Account Statement Date. You are responsible for directly updating, or notifying DomainPeople, of any changes to your credit card (including, but not limited to card number, expiration date, billing address, or card status).
Customers not paying by credit card agree to make payment of their balance due within ten (10) days of the Account Statement Date.
Accounts that are thirty (30) days past due will be automatically suspended. All past due and unpaid balances are subject to collection. In the event of collection, you will be liable for costs of collection including attorney's fees, court costs, and collection agency fees.
BILLING CYCLES (TERMS)
DomainPeople offers three Billing Cycles (terms) for hosting charges: Monthly, Quarterly (3 months) and Yearly (12 months). The Billing Cycle begins on the Plan Activation Date. Resellers are limited to the monthly Billing Cycle for all of their charges. Non-credit card payment methods are limited to Annual or Quarterly Billing Cycles.
You may elect to change your Billing Cycle at any time; however, the new Billing Cycle will only take effect at the time of the next plan renewal.
All additional features added to an account, including any domains, are charged monthly, or otherwise according to the schedule agreed to upon signing up for said features. Additional items are non-refundable.
ACCOUNT RENEWALS
In order to insure that your services remain uninterrupted, all services, including without limitation, hosting, domains, and any additional features, will automatically renew at the end of the relevant billing cycle or registration term. All renewal charges are based on the prevailing rate on the date of renewal according to the service selected. All services are renewed for the same billing cycle/term, with the exception of domain registrations, which are renewed for successive one-year terms. If you wish to cancel any of your services before the relevant expiration/renewal date, please refer to the Cancellation section below
Important Notice Domain name registrations and Web hosting accounts are handled by separate entities. In the event you need to cancel, you must specify whether you would like to cancel your domain name only, your hosting plan only, or both your domain and hosting accounts. The cancellation or expiration of your domain name does not automatically terminate your hosting account (or vice versa). If at any time you elect to manually renew any of your services (in whole or in part), you then become responsible for all future renewals of such services unless and until you notify DomainPeople otherwise.
STATEMENTS
DomainPeople does not mail paper invoices or statements. Statements can be viewed and printed through
SiteControl. Customers may elect to receive their monthly account billing statement via email. This option may be selected in SiteControl.

CANCELLATIONS

Please be aware that there are no pro-rated refunds after the first 30 days of service. Cancellation requests must be received by DomainPeople a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the end of your current Billing Cycle. Cancellations submitted later than this time may result in automatic renewal of your hosting plan for the next Billing Cycle, and the plan will not be terminated until the expiration of that subsequent Billing Cycle. Cancellations become effective on the day processed by DomainPeople. DomainPeople is unable to cancel your account effective for a future date.
DomainPeople does not monitor, and will not automatically cancel, plans for problems related to domain name transfers, non-usage, Internic, your ISP, or any other secondary issues not directly related to DomainPeople’s services. Cancellation of services does not relieve you from paying any outstanding balance owed on the account. DomainPeople reserves the right to cancel any account, at any time, without notice, for any reason DomainPeople considers appropriate.

The following services do not qualify for the 30 Day Money Back Guarantee: additional items and services; domain name registration; dedicated servers; items and services ordered through the reseller program; domain parking plus; and overage fees.
REFUND POLICY
Refunds are only available in accordance with the 30 Day Money Back Guarantee (above). Any refund (if available) will be provided in the same payment method as the original payment. Cancellation requests received beyond the first 30 days of services will not be eligible for any refund, either in whole or in part, of the fees already paid.
