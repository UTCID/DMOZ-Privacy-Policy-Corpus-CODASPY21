The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) regulates how organisations handle the personal information of residents of the State of California and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information.
Snap Surveys may be both a “business” and a “service provider” under the CCPA. We have created a supplemental privacy policy for California residents https://www.snapsurveys.com/survey-software/snap-surveys-supplemental-privacy-policy-california-residents/ where we act as a business, i.e. where we interact directly with consumers, because they use our products or services, or visit our website (other than as a survey respondent).
When we act as a service provider (for example, by providing our survey services to our customers who invite individuals to participate in their surveys), we follow the instructions of the customer who engages us with respect to how we process personal information. We have produced a CCPA Addendum for our customers for whom the CCPA is relevant which confirms our relative roles when we provide our products and services to you. If you would like to enter into an Addendum, please contact us at privacy@snapsurveys.com.
