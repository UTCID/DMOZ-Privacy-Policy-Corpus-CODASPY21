Privacy Policy
At Orient, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Orient and how we use it.
If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through email at inquiry@orientindia.net
Log Files
Orient follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. Almost all websites do this. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.
Cookies
Like any other website, Orient uses ‘cookies’. These cookies are used to store information including visitors’ preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users’ experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors’ browser type and/or other information.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

If you leave a comment or fill up a form, the data and its metadata are retained indefinitely.
