Syslog for Windows – Manual
The manual is also included as a standard Windows help file with all installations. So if you have the product already installed, there is no need to download these documents. If you have it not yet installed, browsing the online manual is probably a good idea to get an overview.
Past manual versions are available for those customers in need of it.
