Saw a notice the other day that I should have a privacy policy.
First of all pages on this site use Google Adsense and Google Analytics which both involve attempted collection of data from visitors.
Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.
Visitors can also opt out of Google Analytics with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
