TrendMetrix Software Inc. Privacy Policy
TrendMetrix is committed to user privacy in its products and services. This
policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If you give us
personal information, we will treat it according to this policy.
This policy covers TrendMetrix's corporate web site. TrendMetrix encourages
you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit. Below is a
summary of TrendMetrix's online privacy policy.
Types and uses of personal information
Customer Feedback and Support.
Provides a mechanism for requesting information from TrendMetrix. Also used
to tell us how we can improve our products, services and site designs.
Email Correspondence.
Used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to
distribute information about TrendMetrix, our products, and services.
Event Registration.
Provides a mechanism for requesting information from you to register in
special events.
We will only use your personal information in the ways
specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way in
which we use your personal information, unless you consent to the new
usage.
Security Measures
We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you
make an online purchase with us, we encrypt your credit card number. Access to
your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job.
Authorized third party agents may also need access to some of your personal
information.
For example, if we need to dispatch something to you, we must
share your name and address with a courier company. We provide third parties
with only the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested
service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with
third parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so.
Data Retention
TrendMetrix will not retain your personal information longer than is
necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
Linked Web Sites
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these Web
sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all)
third party sites.
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age
of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of
13, we will delete that information from our systems.
Cookies
The TrendMetrix Web site uses cookies. Cookies help us to provide you with
targeted information by measuring which Web site areas are of greatest interest.
TrendMetrix also uses cookies when you register for certain Web promotions. In
this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our Web site
to remember you when you return. TrendMetrix can only read cookies from
TrendMetrix Web sites. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can
still access most of our Web sites. Some Web sites will not allow you to
complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. For example, our consumer
e-commerce site uses session cookies and persistent cookies to process
transactions. If you do not accept cookies, the associated shopping bag will not
work and you would not be able to order.
