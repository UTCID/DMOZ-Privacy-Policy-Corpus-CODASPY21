Privacy Policy
Our Privacy PolicyWe take your privacy very seriously.  Our policy protects your privacy and limits what we do with your information.
Information StoredWe do not store any financial information on our servers.  The financial data you record in our apps are stored on your device only.  If you do however choose to backup your data via other services like iCloud, Dropbox or directly to your desktop computer then your data will reside there too.  This protects your financial information but should compel the user to backup their data in a means they see fit.  Doing so will protect from loss if something catastrophic were to occur to their device as there is no means of restore other than backups created by the user..
