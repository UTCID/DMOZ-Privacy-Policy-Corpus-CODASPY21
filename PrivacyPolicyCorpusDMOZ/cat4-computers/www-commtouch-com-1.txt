The Cyren Difference
Data
Cyren provides sustained visibility to massive amounts of data collected from billions of internet transactions daily. The data includes detail for all types of threats. Cyren GlobalView powers automated and continuous classification and analysis of all types of threat related data.
Analytics
Cyren GlobalView applies machine analytics to automatically transform data into actionable insights for tech companies, service providers and enterprises. As the threat landscape has changed, Cyren has developed specialized analytics to detect new types of attacks.
Expertise
Cyren relies on the expertise of dedicated researchers and analysts. These experts use proprietary tools and processes, like our sandbox array. Cyren combines human insight analytics with machine analytics to detect threats, known and new, in seconds to minutes.
No One Knows More About Threat Detection Than Cyren
Cyren GlobalView, with a huge data footprint and analytics, enables effective threat detection for known threats
Detecting NEW malware or unknown threats – threats that have never been seen before – requires advanced threat detection. Zero day, files with modified signatures or no signature at all require advanced threat detection.
Cyren offers a fully automated, multi-vector threat analysis engine, the Cyren Sandbox. To ensure early and accurate detection, Cyren Sandbox automatically chooses from multiple detection techniques to analyze the threat and detonates the malware providing actionable threat intelligence to the threat analysts and SOC.
Fast And Accurate Threat Detection Begins With Comprehensive Threat Intelligence
Cyren GlobalView Threat Intelligence Cloud is bi-directional - it ingests data from Cyren Threat Engines and other sources then applies machine and human analytics to classify and transform data into actionable insights or threats. Cyren customers access threats through SDKs, APIs or Cyren enterprise SaaS applications.
Cyren sees more data - resulting in early and accurate detection of threats like phishing emails, malware in URLs and files and early indicators of virus outbreaks.
Cyren Threat Intelligence is selected by product managers, service providers, threat analysts, threat hunters and enterprise IT security.
