Help Locked Out Users
Help Locked Out Users
Enable users who forgot or locked out their PC login password to access self-service.
When users forget their OS login password or trigger an intruder lockout,
they are in a Catch-22 situation: they cannot log into their computer
and open a web browser but cannot open a web browser to fix their
password and make it possible to log in.
Hitachi ID Bravura Pass includes a variety of mechanisms to address the problem of
users locked out of their PC login screen.
Each of these approaches
has its own strengths and weaknesses, as described below:
* Edge must be used in Desktop Mode
Option
Pros
Cons
1
Ask a neighbor:
Use someone else's web browser to access self-service password reset.
Inexpensive, no client software to deploy.
Users may be working alone or at odd hours.
No solution for local passwords or mobile users.
Wastes time for two users, rather than one.
May violate a security policy in some organizations.
2
Hitachi ID Login Assistant:
Extends the login screen of Windows systems
User friendly, intuitive access to self-service.
Can be configured to assist mobile users who forgot their
cached domain password (by automatically establishing a temporary
VPN connection).
Works on Windows Terminal Server and Citrix Presentation Manager.
Deployment of client software to every PC.
3
Secure kiosk account (SKA):
Sign into any PC with a generic ID such as "help"
and no password.
This launches a kiosk-mode web browser
directed to the password reset web page.
Simple, inexpensive deployment, with no client software
component.
Users can reset both local and network passwords.
Introduces a "generic" account on the network, which may
violate policy, no matter how well it is locked down.
One user can trigger an intruder lockout on the "help" account,
denying service to other users who require a password reset.
Does not help mobile users.
4
Hitachi ID Mobile Access:
Deploy a mobile app, combined with a proxy server in the cloud,
to allow users to access the password reset system from their
smart phone.
Secure and convenient.
Does not help with passwords cached on the user's PC, which
are not affected when the user's domain password is changed
without connection to the PC.
5
Telephone password reset:
Users call an automated system, identify themselves using
touch-tone input of a numeric identifier, authenticate with
touch-tone input of answers to security questions or with
voice print biometrics and select a new password.
Simple deployment of centralized infrastructure.
No client software impact.
May leverage an existing interactive voice response (IVR)
system.
Helpful for remote users who need assistance connecting to the
corporate VPN.
New physical infrastructure is usually required.
Users generally don't like to "talk to a machine"
so adoption rates are lower than with a web portal.
Does not help mobile users who forgot their cached domain password.
Does not help unlock PINs on smart cards.
Watch a Movie
Self Service Anywhere™
Play movie
Content:
A user forgot his primary Windows login password.
The user is away from the office and the corporate AD password
is cached locally.
The video shows how the user can reset
the forgotten password -- from the PC login screen, over WiFi+VPN
and get back to work.
Key concepts:
Users are increasingly mobile.
Mobile users sign into their corporate laptops with cached
domain credentials.
If a user forgets his Windows password while away from the corporate
network, the IT help desk cannot help him, as they cannot access the
cached password.
Using Self-Service, Anywhere, Bravura Pass allows mobile users to reset
forgotten passwords even while away, enabling them to get back to
work before they return to the office.
Without this technology, a remote user who forgot his password cannot
use his PC until he returns -- a major business interruption.

Locked out Windows user resets own password (no software footprint)
Play movie
Content:
A user has either forgotten his password or triggered an
intruder lockout.
The user's PC runs any version of Windows.
The user wishes to unlock his account without calling the
help desk.
Key concepts:
Access to SSPR is available using a secure kiosk account.
This approach eliminates the need to install any software on the PC.
The trade-off is a special domain account, typically called
help which every user can sign into but which has minimal
security entitlements.

Assisted password reset
Play movie
Content:
The experience of a help desk analyst resetting passwords
for a user who has forgotten his password or triggered
a lockout.
Key concepts:
Help desk staff may be forced to authenticate callers,
for example by prompting them with security questions and
keying in their answers.
Help desk staff may be empowered or required to cause
new passwords to be immediately expired.
“Behind the scenes,” a help desk ticket is normally
created to record the service incident.
