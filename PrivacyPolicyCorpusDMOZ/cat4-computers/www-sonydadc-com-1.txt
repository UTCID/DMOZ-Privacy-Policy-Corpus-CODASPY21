in addition, DADC, as well as certain third-party analytics and other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you use the DADC Websites (“Usage Information“). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time at which a page was accessed and/or the time spent on a page, and the preceding pages views.
DADC may receive information about you from third parties. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. When we obtain personal data from third parties, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the personal data received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

This may include verifying your identity, taking payments, communicating with you, providing customer services and arranging the delivery or other provision of products, prizes or services;

Who will we share this data with, and where?

DADC may share your personal data with companies affiliated with DADC (“Affiliates“), so that those Affiliates can (i) assist us with fulfilling your requests or improving our products, content, services or advertising; and/or (ii) contact you about products, content, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.

To Third-Party Service Providers Providing Services On DADC’s Behalf

As one example, if you access content or services that are published, developed or supported by an Affiliate or third party, your personal data may be shared with that Affiliate or third party for purposes related to that content or those services, including service administration and/or development. Additionally, we may share your information in order to host or operate the DADC Websites, for data analysis purposes, and for the administration of Promotions.
When You Consent To Have Your Personal Data Shared or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information
We may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties for example so you are able to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties. Additionally, you may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third-party application, that we share personal data about you with a third party, and we will typically do so in those circumstances. If you consent or request to receive communications from third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.
The provisions above apply to our sharing of personal data with Affiliates and third-party service providers. They do not cover use of personal data that those Affiliates and third-party service providers collect directly from you. Such use of personal data is covered by the relevant Affiliate’s and/or third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.
Business Transactions
We may share your personal data with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes including any corporate reorganization, restructuring or other corporate change. In addition, DADC or any of its assets, including the DADC Websites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal data is one of the key business assets in the transaction. In such a case, your personal data may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, DADC reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal data, in connection with any activity and/or transaction described above.

Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
