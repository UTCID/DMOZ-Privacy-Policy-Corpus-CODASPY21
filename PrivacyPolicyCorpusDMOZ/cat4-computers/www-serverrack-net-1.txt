Privacy Policy
ServerRack.net's
policies and procedures for handling customer
information have been created with the understanding
that Internet technologies are still evolving
and that Internet business methods are continuing
to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities
of the changing technologies. As a result,
ServerRack.net's policies and procedures are subject
to change.
In the course
of serving its customers, ServerRack.net acquires,
stores, and transmits customer communications
and information that customers may regard
as private or sensitive. Some of this information
-- such as the customer's name, address, telephone
number, and credit card data -- is provided
to ServerRack.net by its customers in order
to establish service. Other information --
such as the customer's account status, choice
of services, and customer logs - is created
and maintained by ServerRack.net in the normal
course of providing service. ServerRack.net
also uses cookies, which are small pieces
of information that a web site can store in
a designated file on a user's computer for
various reasons. In addition, ServerRack.net
may store customers' electronic mail and other
communications as a necessary incident to
the transmission and delivery of those communications.
Data
Security
ServerRack.net will
protect the confidentiality of its customers'
information, account information, and personal
communications to the fullest extent possible
and consistent with the law and the legitimate
interests of ServerRack.net, its partners, its employees,
and other customers of ServerRack.net's services.
To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration
of information that is collected from customers,
ServerRack.net has appropriate physical, electronic,
and managerial procedures in place.
How
is customer information used?
ServerRack.net
will not share customer information with third
parties for the purpose of marketing or mailing
lists. ServerRack.net may use customer information
to provide its customers with system information
or information about its own new or upgraded
products.
Disclosure
of customer information and communications
ServerRack.net will
not otherwise disclose its customers' personal
and account information unless ServerRack.net has
reason to believe that disclosing such information
is necessary to identify, make contact with,
or bring legal action against someone who
may be causing harm or interfering with the
rights or property of ServerRack.net, ServerRack.net's customers,
or others, or where ServerRack.net has a good faith
belief that the law requires such disclosure.
ServerRack.net also
will not, except for reasons stated below,
disclose to third parties the contents of
any electronic mail or other electronic communications
that ServerRack.net stores or transmits for its customers.
The circumstances under which ServerRack.net will
disclose such electronic customer communications
are when:
it is necessary
in order to provide service to the customer;
it is
necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of ServerRack.net and its customers;
it is
required to cooperate with interception
orders, warrants, or other legal process
that ServerRack.net determines in its sole
discretion to be valid and enforceable;
and
it is necessary
to provide to a law enforcement agency when
the contents are inadvertently obtained
by ServerRack.net and appear to pertain
to the commission of a crime.
ServerRack.net
disclaims any intention to censor, edit or
engage in ongoing review or surveillance of
communications stored on or transmitted through
its facilities by customers or others. ServerRack.net
will, however, review, delete or block access
to communications that may harm ServerRack.net,
its customers or third parties. The grounds
on which ServerRack.net may take such action
include, but are not limited to, actual or
potential violations of ServerRack.net's Acceptable
Use Policy.
