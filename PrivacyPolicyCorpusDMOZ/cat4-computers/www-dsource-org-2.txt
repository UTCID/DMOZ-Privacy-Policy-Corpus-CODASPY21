18. General Provisions
Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue - The Site (excluding any linked Third Party Sites) is controlled by SGI from its offices within the State of Texas, United States of America. The parties agree that the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof, shall govern all matters relating to access to, or use of, the Site and the Service available through the Site. The parties specifically disclaim the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The parties agree that any action brought by the parties to enforce or interpret any provision of the TOS shall be brought exclusively in an appropriate state court in Harris County or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston. The parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and waive any objection to such venue. Site Providers make no representation that the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and accessing the Site from territories where its contents are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so upon their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
Force Majeure - Except with regard to the payment of money, no party shall be responsible for any delays caused by acts of God or any other cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to such things as strikes, riots, acts of war or terrorism, restricting legislation, embargo, blockage, work stoppage, major outage of a public communications carrier, etc. Any delay caused by one party hereto which affects any other party's ability to perform according to the terms of the TOS shall extend the non-delaying party's obligation to perform by the same number of days by which the delaying party delayed in performing its obligations.
Severability / Waiver - Each provision of the TOS is severable; if any provision is declared void, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the appropriate judicial body to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable while effectuating insofar as possible the basic purposes of such provision. The remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. No delay, omission, or failure to exercise any right or remedy provided for in the TOS shall be deemed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence in the event giving rise to such remedy (but every such right or remedy may be exercised as the party exercising such right or remedy deems expedient).
Entire Agreement / Survival - The TOS constitute the entire agreement between Site Providers, on the one hand, and You, on the other, with respect to use of the Service and supersedes all prior agreements or previous discussions (written or oral) between the parties. The TOS have been written in the English language and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the English-language version and any translation hereof, the English language version shall prevail. The TOS may be modified by Site Providers by giving You the opportunity to electronically review and agree to the new TOS. Site Providers also will post the new TOS on the Site in the same location the previous TOS was posted. Any provision in the TOS that may reasonably be interpreted as being intended by the parties to survive the termination or expiration of the TOS shall survive any such termination or expiration.
