There is a link to the Cloudflare Privacy Policy on the Cloudflare home page.Information That We Do Not ShareAs an exception to the IETF/IRTF/IAB’s general policy of releasing information to the public, there are certain limited types of Personal Data that we do not share in the ordinary course of our operations ("Non-Public Information"). The categories of Non-Public Information that we currently recognize are described below.Applications for roles, awards/prizes, grants and workshopsThe IETF/IRTF/IAB operates a number of processes where individuals may submit Personal Data about themselves or others and where all information is kept confidential, including any reviews, assessments, deliberations, interviews or other discussions, except as specified below. These processes are:Applications for roles, except the names of applicantsFeedback on individuals regarding a role application or performance in a roleNominations for awards/prizes, except the names of award/prize winnersPapers submitted for workshops, except the published papersApplications for travel grants, except the names of grant recipients.Payment InformationPayment information is not collected or stored on any servers operated by the IETF/IRTF/IAB. If you conduct transactions using our websites (e.g., meeting registration), payment and payment card information will be entered directly into a third-party processor's systems and is not transmitted through or stored by our websites. We make reasonable efforts to ensure that our third-party processors handle your non-public information responsibly.Registration InformationWe collect information from people who register for meetings. The attendee lists which are published in the meeting proceedings include the registrants, name, organization and ISO country code, a profile link (if provided in the registration) and whether the registration was local or remote. All other information we collect is only published, if at all, in summary form.Demographic InformationWe may ask you to provide demographic information (e.g. age, sex, country of residence) in surveys or other information gathering activities. You are not required to provide that information and your disclosure of that information to us is voluntary. We do not disclose the demographic information of individuals. We may publish aggregated information using demographic data as one dimension, in which case we will aggregate at a sufficient level to prevent disaggregation or deanonymization.Non-Public Mailing ListsA small number of the mailing lists we operate are not available or disclosed to the public, nor are their contents made available to the public. These mailing lists are clearly indicated as non-public in their registration materials.Direct emails to individuals connected with a PartyEmail sent directly to an individual member, employee, contractor or director of a Party generally will not be made available to the public.Information for letters of invitationWe delete the personal information that we collect to generate letters of invitation in a timely fashion after each meeting. We request that local organizations with whom we share this data to generate the letters also delete it in a timely fashion.Protection of Non-Public InformationWe have implemented commercially reasonable precautions that we believe are appropriate to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure and alteration of Non-Public Information. However, no data security measures can guarantee complete data security, and we do not guarantee the confidentiality of anything that you submit to us. Please contact us if you believe that the security or integrity of any non-public information that you have submitted to us has been compromised.Legally required disclosureWe may at times be required by law to release Non-Public Information, and we will do so if we believe in good faith that such release is required by applicable law, regulation or judicial order.ChildrenOur online services are not intended for use by children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, or target our online services at, children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, without the consent and participation of a parent or guardian, we will remove it from our systems.Links to other sitesOccasionally, our website or communications will link to websites or services operated by third parties, for example, to conferencing services. We make no representation about the privacy policies of such sites.Contact and ComplianceIf you have any questions regarding this Statement or believe that we are not following the procedures described in this Statement, please contact privacy@ietf.org. You can also contact us if you have any concerns about the accuracy of, or wish to correct, your Personal Data, or if you wish us to cease processing your Personal Data. We reserve the right to decline any request to remove or alter information or to cease processing your Personal Data except to the extent that we are legally required to do so.Updated December 23, 2019
