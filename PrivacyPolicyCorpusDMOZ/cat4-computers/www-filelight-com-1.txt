Privacy Statement
We
respect and are committed to protecting your privacy.
That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal
information is processed and used. We promise that
we will take steps to use your personal information
only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy
Policy. The following policies are only in effect
for the Web pages, forums, and opt-in announcement
lists owned and operated by FileLight.com. The following
discloses our Privacy Policy.
What information are you collecting and how
are you collecting it?
Every computer connected to the Internet is given
a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve
as that computer's "Internet Protocol"
IP address. When a visitor requests a page from
any Web Site within the FileLight.com, our Web
servers automatically recognize that visitor's
domain name and IP address. The domain name and
IP address reveal nothing personal about you other
than the IP address from which you have accessed
our Site. We use this information to examine our
traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse
of FileLight.com, its users, or to cooperate with
law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate
this information for specific individuals. Our
Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of
the visitors.
What are cookies?
From time to time, FileLight.com or its advertisers
may send a "cookie" to your computer.
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent
to your browser from a web server and stored on
your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read
data off your hard disk or read cookie files created
by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your
system. We use cookies to identify which areas
of FileLight.com you have visited or customized,
so the next time you visit, those pages may be
readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use
cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen
an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use
this information to better personalize the content,
banners, and promotions that you see on our Site.
You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing
the settings of your browser. You can reset your
browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser
to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you
choose not to accept these cookies, your experience
at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished
and some features may not work as intended.
What information do you collect when I register
for something?
FileLight.com offers access to some services that
are free but require registration. We may use
your registration contact information to send
you notification of new FileLight.com services
by e-mail. We do not share any information with
third parties except advertisers, who may collect
their own information from the ads placed on our
site.
What other information do you request?
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing
address for the purposes of conducting a survey
or to provide additional features (for example,
subscriptions to e-mail newsletters or resource
submissions). We maintain a strict "No-Spam"
policy that means that we will never sell, rent,
or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party,
without your consent.
When you sign up for a FileLight.com forum account,
your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes
of maintaining your own account within the forums.
This information is not used to monitor your activity
within a forum, nor is it used to identify you
outside the forums in any way.
When you enter a promotion, we may ask for your
name, mailing address, and e-mail address so we
can administer the contest and notify winners.
Once again, we will never sell, rent, or otherwise
give your personal information to a third-party
without your consent.
What else should I know about my privacy when
online?
The FileLight.com network of Web sites contains
many hyperlinks to other Web sites. The FileLight.com
network also contains advertisements of third
parties. FileLight.com is not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of such Web
sites or advertisers. FileLight.com does not share
any of the individual personal information you
provide FileLight.com with the Web sites to which
FileLight.com links, except as stated elsewhere
within this Privacy Policy. We may share aggregate
data with such Web sites (such as how many people
use our Site).
Please check with those Web sites to determine
their privacy policy.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily
disclose personal information online - for example
through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere
- that information can be collected and used by
others. In short, if you post personal information
online that is accessible to the public, you may
receive unsolicited messages from other parties
in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining
the secrecy of your personal information. Please
be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
Your Consent To This Agreement
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection
and use of information by FileLight.com as specified
above. If we decide to change our privacy policy,
we will post those changes on this page so that
you are always aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under what circumstances we
disclose it.
