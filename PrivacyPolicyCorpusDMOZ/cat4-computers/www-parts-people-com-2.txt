About Our Company
About Parts-People.com, Inc
Nathan Morgan
Founder & CEO
Most of our orders are from repeat customers.
Parts-People began as a small company 18 years ago in an extra bedroom of my house. I had saved a small sum of money to purchase some computer parts and began selling them on eBay. After a few months I realized that people needed a place to go for Dell parts so I began building our website. Since we are located in Austin, Texas, where Dell.com was founded, I was able to set up a solid supply line with Dell. From the start, we focused on customer satisfaction and selling quality parts. We have grown a lot since 2002 but
still and always the customer will come first. You will find that we go above and beyond with every order and offer free resources and support before and after the sale.
