General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Statement
Legitimate Interests:
Under the new data protection law starting in May 2018 we have a number of lawful reasons that we can use (or 'process') your personal information.
One of the lawful reasons is called 'legitimate interests'.
We process personal information for certain legitimate business purposes, which include some or all of the following:
• where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our services / communications for the benefit of our customers
• to identify and prevent fraud
• to enhance the security of our network and information systems
• to better understand how people interact with our websites
• to provide marketing communications which we think will be of interest to you
• to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising
Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your Personal Data rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to
object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so please email moreinfo@amcuk.com
Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above for your benefit.
Your personal data - what is it?
'Personal data' is any information about a living individual which allows them to be identified from that data (for example a name, photographs, videos, email address, or address).
Identification can be directly using the data itself or by combining it with other information which helps to identify a living individual (e.g. a list of staff may contain personnel ID numbers rather than names but if you use a separate list of the ID numbers which give the corresponding names to identify the staff in the first list then the first list will also be treated as personal data).
The processing of personal data is governed by legislation relating to personal data which applies in the United Kingdom including the General Data Protection Regulation (the 'GDPR') and other legislation relating to personal data and rights such as the Human Rights Act.
Who are we?
This Privacy Notice is provided to you by the Advanced Modular Computers Limited

Do we need your consent to process your sensitive personal data?
•	In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain sensitive personal data.
If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the personal data that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent.
We will comply with data protection law. This says that the personal data we hold about you must be:

An example of this would be processing your data in connection with an order your have placed with us.
Sometimes the use of your personal data requires your consent. We will first obtain your consent to that use.
Sharing your personal data
This section provides information about the third parties with whom we may share your personal data.
These third parties have an obligation to put in place appropriate security measures and will be responsible to you directly for the manner in which they process and protect your personal data. It is likely that we will need to share your data with some or all of the following (but only where necessary):
•	Our agents, suppliers and contractors. For example, we may ask a commercial provider to publish or distribute newsletters on our behalf, or to maintain our database software;
How long do we keep your personal data?
We will keep some records permanently if we are legally required to do so.
We may keep some other records for an extended period of time. For example, it is currently best practice to keep financial records for a minimum period of 8 years to support HMRC audits or provide tax information.
We are permitted to retain data in order to defend or pursue claims.
In some cases the law imposes a time limit for such claims (for example 3 years for personal injury claims or 6 years for contract claims).
We will retain some personal data for this purpose as long as we believe it is necessary to be able to defend or pursue a claim.
In general, we will endeavour to keep data only for as long as we need it.
This means that we will delete it when it is no longer needed.
