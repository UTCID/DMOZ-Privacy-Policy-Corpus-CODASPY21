Bersoft Software & Technology Privacy Policy
We do not use cookies to track your use of our site and we only collect the
information that you voluntarily supply when you purchase an application.
We outsource our sales, they are handled by MyCommerce, a leading Online Payment Processor, who acts as our only reseller.
Hence, we don't collect any credit card or bank account information about our customers, because we never see it.
You can download any of our applications without entering
any information.
If you purchase any of our applications, only your email, name, location and registration name will be stored in our database. We need that information to verify our customers identity when providing technical support by email.
The collected information will not be shared with anyone and it is NOT stored
online, so your data hardly can be stolen.
Junk emailers and forged return addresses
Be aware that Junk emailers often use forged return addresses. If you receive
unsolicited e-mail that seems to came from bersoft.com, please take
the time to read the e-mail headers to notice from where the email really comes.
At the bottom of this page there is an example of a typical e-mail that comes
from a known spammer who used a forged e-mail return address to simulate that
the email comes from ad_ad_path@bersoft.com.
Notice that the headers below have three Received:
fields. Every mail server that handles the message adds another Received:
field to the header. You can use this field to see where a message came from
and where it has been.
The last received IP Number (marked below in blue) is the one that shows where
the spam came from. That means that this message was sent, but no by a Yahoo
user, as it seems, but most probably he was
one spammer in Taiwan, since Whois search shows that the country for the number 218.32.192.58 is Taiwan, and that coincides with the email address at the bottom, marked in green.
