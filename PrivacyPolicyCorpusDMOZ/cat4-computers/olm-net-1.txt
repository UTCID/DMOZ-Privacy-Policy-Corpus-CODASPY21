This includes, but is not limited to, hacking, phishing, flooding, mail bombing, or other deliberate attempts to overload or crash an ISP, host or network. To protect its network and periodically audit for malicious activity, OLM installs a host key on all dedicated servers which may not be removed. OLM will cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with Law Enforcement Authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations. Users who violate system or network security may incur criminal or civil liability.3. Spam/Commercial Advertising/Mass MailingOLM EXPLICITLY FORBIDS ANY AND ALL TYPES OF MASS MAILING (SPAMMING) ON OUR SERVERS AND NETWORK. You must not use the OLM services, or any OLM email address in connection with the transmission of spam, flames, mail bombs, or substantially similar, unsolicited email messages. Your domain may not be referenced as originator, intermediary, or reply-to address in any of the above. This prohibition extends to the sending of unsolicited mass mailings from another service that in any way implicates the use of the OLM service or equipment or any OLM.net email address. A message is considered unsolicited if it is posted in violation of a newsgroup charter or if it is sent to a recipient who has not requested or invited the message. For purposes of this provision, merely making one's email address accessible to the public will not constitute a request or invitation to receive messages. If you are found to have spammed, without warning, OLM reserves the right to disable your domain. In addition, OLM may impose a $100 penalty for each spam policy violation. OLM solely reserves the right to refuse or cancel service to known spammers. OLM reserves the right to determine what violates this policy. As such, any violation may result in cancellation of services without refund. PLEASE REPORT ANY SPAM OR NETWORK ABUSE TO abuse at OLM.net.4.

You do not acquire ownership rights to any content, document or other materials viewed through the Site. The posting of information or materials on the Site does not constitute a waiver of any right in such information and materials. Some of the content on the site is the copyrighted work of third parties.6. Server Resources.All shared hosting accounts utilize technology which limits the overall resources on a per cPanel account bases to protect the integrity of the overall server from being negatively impacted by any one domain. These settings have been tested to assure that the majority of websites will operate well within these guidelines.6a. Resource UsageUser may not:Use 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.Run any type of web spider or indexer on shared servers.Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site but may not host or store them on shared servers.Offer any type of downloads, this would include the distribution of files such as .zip, mp3, mp4, .gunzip, tar, and other similar files.Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activitiesRun any gaming servers such as counter-strike, etc ...Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes.Run any MySQL queries longer than 15 seconds and MySQL tables should be indexed properly.When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include("http://yourdomain.com/include.php") use include("include.php")To help reduce usage, do not force HTML to handle server-side code (like php and shtml).Only use https protocol when necessary; encrypting and decrypting communications is noticeably more CPU-intensive than unencrypted communications.7. Backup/Restores.Your use of this service is at your sole risk. Our general backup service runs once per week,  overwrites any of our previous backups made, and only one week of backups are kept.
