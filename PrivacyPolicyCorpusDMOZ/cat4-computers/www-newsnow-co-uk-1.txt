This Privacy Policy applies to personal data or information that we collect about you:

(We’ll use the words ‘data’ and ‘information’ interchangeably.)
Unless otherwise stated below, NewsNow Publishing Limited (“NewsNow”, “we”,
“us” or “our”) is the data controller of the personal data that we
collect and process. For details on how to contact our Data Protection Officer, please see section 9 below.
Where indicated, we contract third parties to process data on our behalf. These third parties act as data processors, which means
that they act only on our instructions and are not authorised to share the data that they process for us with anyone else, and that
we remain the controller of such data.
By continuing to use any of our sites, you acknowledge our collection, storage and use of your personal information as
described below.
2 The data we collect about you
The term “personal data”, or “personal information”, means any information
about an individual from which that person can be identified.
It does not include data where the identity has been removed
(i.e. anonymous data).
We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you in the following circumstances:
When you visit our sites
Our sites include http://www.NewsNow.co.uk,
http://mobile.NewsNow.co.uk, http://www.NewsNow.it,
http://mobile.NewsNow.it/, and any other sites we might launch in the future
(“sites”).
They also include NewsNow Classifieds, our classified ad aggregation service, available at
http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/classifieds/.
They do not include sites we link to that are owned and/or operated by third parties. We are not responsible and accept no
liability for the privacy practices of such sites or other services. This Privacy Policy applies only to our own sites
and services.
Website functionality
We aim to provide our users with useful services through site functionality, some of which depends on our collecting and storing information relating to your preferences or browsing behaviour.
When you are not signed into a NewsNow account, we store this in persistent cookies on your web browser.
When you are signed into a NewsNow account, we store some of this information on our servers instead, in a manner that links it to your NewsNow account, so that it can be shared between different devices from which you have signed in.
Cookies more generally
For further details of how we use cookies on our site, please see our
Cookie Policy.
Children’s data
Our sites are not aimed at under-18s. Some content that is accessible on or via our sites will not be appropriate for children
under the age of 18.
Special data
We do not seek to collect any special categories of personal data about you: those would include details about your race or
ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership,
information about your health and genetic and biometric data. Nor do we seek to collect any information about criminal
convictions and offences.
If, however, when using any interactive feature of the site (such as an online contact form), you
in fact provide us with any such special data or information about criminal convictions and offences, then by submitting such
data/information, we’ll assume that you are fine with our use of such data/information for (a) the purpose for which
you have voluntarily provided such data/information and (b) any purpose that is reasonably compatible with such purpose. You
may withdraw that permission at any time by contacting us: please see section 9 below for our contact details.
If you fail to provide personal data
Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract that we have with you and you fail to provide
that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract that we have or are trying to enter into with you (for
example, to provide you with services). If so, we shall notify you if this is the case at the time.
3 How we use your personal data
We shall only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so.
We have set out below a description of all the ways that we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we
rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where
appropriate.
Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one legal ground depending on the specific purpose for which
we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground that we are relying on to process
your personal data where more than one ground has been set out below.
Processing purposes
Analytics and web logs
When you visit our sites, we use analytics tools to collect, store and analyse standard web log data, which includes the web
page you have requested, the web page from which you clicked a link to NewsNow (if applicable), your computer’s public
IP address, your web browser’s name, version number and screen size and preferred language, and your device’s operating system, and any cookies we have
stored when you have previously accessed our sites (if you haven’t configured your browser to refuse to store them).
In order to diagnose bugs, to gain a better understanding of usage patterns and interactions, and to identify and block abusive patterns of
access, our analytics tools generate and store a unique browser identifier in a persistent cookie on your browser, which we log
with each web page you request. This lets us distinguish unique users and link the log data we collect when you visit the site,
with the log data from your previous and subsequent visits.
Our log data are only collected and processed in a way that does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to link this
data to any personally identifiable information you might give us when submitting an online enquiry or feedback form, subscribing to our
newsletter, or signing up for or into a NewsNow account (except as NewsNow account features require – see below – or with your explicit consent).
We operate: an in-house analytics tool; a third-party analytics tool called Google Analytics, a service run by Google
acting under contract as a data processor; and a further third-party analytics tool called Hotjar, a service run by Hotjar Ltd.
We store your full IP address in our in-house web logs to allow us to identify and block abusive patterns of access. We also determine your country
and city from your IP address, to understand usage patterns. Your IP address is anonymised when processed by Google Analytics and Hotjar.
We retain our own in-house web log data records for around 30 days. Google Analytics does not allow us to access individual web
log records. Hotjar retains web log data records for 365 days. We retain aggregated and anonymised log data indefinitely in our in-house analytics tool, in Google Analytics,
and when we have exported it from Hotjar.
You can opt out of data collection by Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, supplied by
Google here:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. You can opt out of data collection by Hotjar by visiting https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out/.
For more about Hotjar, please see about Hotjar.
We use those tools to allow us to diagnose bugs when they occur, to identify and block abusive patterns of access in order to
maintain the security and performance of our sites, and to improve our services through understanding usage patterns and interactions.

Online advertising
We may serve personalised advertising content on web pages that you visit on the site, in which case we and/or our ad network
partners may use personal data relating to you to generate such personalised advertising content.
Please note that our operations are funded by online advertising. We work directly with many firms (partners) to get the best
value from our ad space. Some, known as ‘exchanges’, resell our ad space in a global market of products and services of
brands and retailers, through their own direct relationships with those brands/retailers or other firms that represent them.
Other partners provide us with other services, such as ad serving.
Our exchange partners may perform some of the following activities:
Collecting and processing information about your use of our sites with the aim of subsequently personalising advertising
for you on our sites, or in other contexts, such as on other sites or apps. Typically, the pages of our site that you
access are used to make inferences about your interests, which when combined together (to create a profile) inform
future selection of advertising.
Selecting and delivering advertisements to you. This includes using contextual information about the pages of our site
that you access, which may be combined with previously collected information about you to select ads.
Measurement of delivery and performance of ads and user activity, which includes processing data about what ads were
shown, how often they were shown, when and where they were shown, and whether you took any action related to the ad,
such as clicking an ad or making a purchase.
Our partners, in performing any of the above activities, do so where either they have independently obtained consent (which
we may have facilitated) or have established a legal basis other than consent for those activities.
Our main partners include the following, and please see their own privacy policies for further details of their
own privacy and cookies practices:

direct marketing emails, unless you have given your prior opt-in consent to do so.

(b) Necessary for our legitimate interests (where the law allows to send marketing about similar services)
Change of purpose
We shall only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected the data, unless we reasonably consider that
we need to use such data for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you would like to
get an explanation of how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we shall notify you and explain the legal basis on which we
intend to rely.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, if
and to the extent that this is required or permitted by law.
4 Disclosures of your personal data

Other disclosures
In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may share
your personal information if we believe in good faith that access to or use, preservation or disclosure of such information is
reasonably necessary: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) to
enforce any contractual rights that we may have in relation to the services we provide to you; (c) to detect, prevent or
otherwise deal with fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of

confidentiality of any personal information involved in such a transaction until (if at all) such personal information is
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
5 International transfers
Some of the disclosures described above may involve a transfer of data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we strive to ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded
to such data by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
transferring data to a provider based in the USA, if such provider adheres to the
Privacy Shield framework,
an agreement between the EU and the USA designed to protect data transferred between the two regions;
transferring your personal data to a country, organisation or sector that has, at the time of transfer, been deemed to
provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; and/or
using specific forms of contract approved by the European Commission that give personal data the same protection it
within Europe.
For further details of such safeguards, please see the European Commission’s website.
Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal
data out of the EEA.
6 Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures (including user authentication software and secure data-sharing feeds) to
prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have
a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of
confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach, and we shall notify you and any applicable
regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
7 Data retention
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected such data, including
for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your personal data: please see section 8 below for further
information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
8 Your legal rights
You may have the following rights (which may, in certain circumstances, be subject to certain exceptions under data protection laws):
(a) Right to be informed — you have the right to be told how your personal information will be used.

with a clear and transparent description of how your personal information may be used.

have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This includes the right to ask us to stop using your personal information

of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
certain content or services to you. We shall inform you if that is the case at the time when you withdraw your consent.
(c) Right to access — you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what information we hold on you
and to request a copy of that information. We may need to seek evidence that you are entitled to see the information requested
and to confirm your identity.
(d) Right to rectification — if our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the
right to ask for those records to be updated.
We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.
(e) Right to erasure — you can ask us for your personal information to be deleted from our records where
(i) there is no good reason for our continuing to process such data, (ii) you have successfully exercised your right to object
to processing (see below), (iii) we may have processed your information unlawfully or (iv) we are required to erase your personal
data to comply with local law. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
(f) Right to restrict processing — you may have the right to ask for processing of your personal data
to be restricted, where (i) you would like us to establish the accuracy of such data; (ii) our use of the data is unlawful,
but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require the data as you need
the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to
verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use the data.
(g) Right to data portability — where we are processing your personal information (i) with your consent,
(ii) because such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your
request before entering into a contact or (iii) by automated means, you may ask us to provide it to you – or to another service
provider – in a machine-readable format.
(h) Right to object to processing — you may have the right to object to processing of your personal data
where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation
that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you believe that it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may
demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.
(i) Right to not to be subject to automated decision-making where that would have a significant effect on you.
We do not in fact engage in such activities, so this right will not, in practice, be relevant in the context of your use of our
sites.
To exercise these rights, please send a description of the personal information in question using the contact details at
section 9 below. Where we consider that the information with which you have provided us does not enable us to
identify the personal information in question, we reserve the right to ask for (i) personal identification and/or (ii) further
information.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). We may, however, charge
a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
request in those circumstances.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request
is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we shall notify you and keep you updated.
As noted above, some of these rights only apply in limited circumstances. For more information, we suggest that you consult the
guidance of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) —
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/ — or
please contact us using the details provided at section 9 below.
You are further entitled to make a complaint about us or the way we have processed your data to the ICO. For further information
on how to exercise this right, please see the guidance at
https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/personal-information. The contact details of the ICO can be found here:
