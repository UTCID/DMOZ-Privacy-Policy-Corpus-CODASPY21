2. Cookies & Similar Technologies
2.1 Summary
Most Helix web sites use "cookies," small pieces of data that can be read
by a web server in the same domain that put the cookie on your hard drive.
We may use cookies to help us retrieve your preferences and settings; help
with sign-in; to combat fraud; and analyze site operations.
We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics.
These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from
collecting your personal information.
You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies,
including:
- Browser controls to block and delete cookies; and
- Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in
web beacons.
2.2 Full text
2.2.1 Our Use of Cookies
Most Helix web sites use “cookies,” which are small pieces of data sent to
your browser by a web server. Upon subsequent requests, your browser will
send the cookie data to the same web server, or other web servers in the
same domain, when accessing the web site. Cookies contain data that can be
read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That data
often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies
your computer but may contain other information as well. Here is an example
of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Helix might place on your
device when you visit one of our web sites:
9ha56er983130kmrtsx6jjabseniu65sjdjnnu9
We may use cookies for:
- Sign-in and Authentication
When you sign in to a site or service using your account on an Helix web
site, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an
encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from
page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When
you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. This is
commonly referred to as a “session cookie”. We also use cookies to improve
the sign-in experience. For example, your user name may be stored in a
cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie
allows your user name to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to
type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public
computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the
appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be
used.
- Site Analytics
We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or
service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of
our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the
performance of these sites and services.
In addition to the cookies Helix may set when you visit our web sites,
third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit
Helix sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party
to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other
cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third
parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad
networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers
to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their
own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online
activities across websites or online services.
2.2.2 How to Control Cookies
- Browser Controls to Block Cookies.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
your browser setting to block cookies. Instructions for blocking cookies in
different browsers are usually available at each browser’s privacy
statement or in their help files or settings pages.
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to
sign in or use other interactive features of Helix sites and services that
depend on cookies.
- Browser Controls to Delete Cookies
If you accept cookies, you can delete them later. Instructions for deleting
cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browser’s
privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and
preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be
recreated.
- Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection
Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of
these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web
sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites
(or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in
activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this
preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is not
yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Helix does
not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or
online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Helix
provides content or is otherwise able to collect information.
2.2.3 Our Use of Web Beacons
Helix web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons -
sometimes called single pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver
cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and
deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional
e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been
opened and acted upon.
Finally, Helix sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us
compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our
promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may
allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. These
companies may collect information about your online activities across
websites or online servers, however, we prohibit third parties from using
web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information.
You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party
analytics companies by opting out on their respective web sites.
2.2.4 Other Similar Technologies
In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other
technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be
done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by
storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be
used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used
to track behavior.
- Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies"
Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or
"Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. Note that the ability to
clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting
for standard cookies as that may vary by browser. To manage or block Flash
cookies, go to the appropriate settings page, currently to be found at
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.
- Silverlight Application Storage
Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also
have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To
learn how to manage or block such storage, visit the Silverlight Privacy
Statement.
