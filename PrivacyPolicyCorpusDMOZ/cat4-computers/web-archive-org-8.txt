THE AOL MEMBER AGREEMENT
Welcome to AOL . By registering for AOL or using AOL services,
software and products, you agree to be bound by this Member
Agreement and the rules and policies published on AOL (including
AOL 's Community Guidelines and Privacy Policy). You also agree to
transact electronically with AOL .
1. ABOUT THE AOL TERMS OF SERVICE
This Member Agreement, the Community Guidelines and the Privacy
Policy collectively make up the AOL Terms of Service. The AOL
Terms of Service govern your AOL membership and your use of the
AOL Online Service and any of the AOL Services (as defined below).
Certain features and services offered by AOL and its Suppliers
(such as AOL Call Alert, AIM , and AOL Music Now) contain
additional terms or guidelines that supplement this Member
Agreement and will govern the use of those services. You will have
an opportunity to review the additional terms before you sign up
or use those services.
2. DEFINITIONS
AOL will use the following terms in this Member Agreement:
a. Account - The original account you open when you
register for AOL membership through which you obtain access
to the AOL Online Service and other AOL Services, and all
sub-accounts or other accounts opened under your original
account.
b. AOL Online Service - The primary U.S.
online information, entertainment, communications and
transactions service, including all Software for accessing
the AOL Online Service, which is offered under various
subscription plans, including Internet connectivity
subscription plans.
c. AOL Services - The AOL Online Service and all other
websites, software, services and products offered by AOL.
d. Content - Information, software, games,
communications, photos, video, graphics, music, sound and
other materials provided by or through the AOL Services.
e. Software - Any software made available from AOL or
a Supplier, whether preinstalled, given on a medium, provided
by download or made available online that enable you to
access and use AOL Services.
f. Supplier - Any third-party distributor of AOL
Services, any third-party provider of Software for AOL
Services, any third-party provider of Content for AOL
Services and any third-party telecommunications provider.
3. QUALIFICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP
To use the AOL Services, you must be a U.S. resident and legally
able to enter into contracts. AOL reserves the right to limit you
to one free trial or promotion of a paid subscription plan that
cannot be combined with other offers.
4. REGISTRATION FOR MEMBERSHIP
You must register in your own name and provide true and current
information. AOL will open an Account for you when you complete
your registration. You will select (or AOL will assign you) a
primary screen name that will be identified with your Account for
the life of your account. You can use this primary screen name to
log on to AOL Services and to send e-mail. You will not be able to
change your primary screen name; however, depending on your plan,
you will have the opportunity to open sub-accounts by creating
additional screen names. Screen names may not be vulgar, used by
someone else, or impersonate someone else. AOL in its sole
discretion may reject the use or assignment of a screen name. All
AOL screen names affiliated with your Account are the property of
AOL and, at AOL 's sole discretion, expire upon the cancellation
or termination of your Account. Please visit Keyword: Names
5. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT
You are responsible for all activity on your Account (including
activities on any sub-accounts or any of the sub-accounts you may
spin-off as a separate account). You must supervise the use of
your Account by others, including minors and teen-agers. You and
your Account may be subject to disciplinary action or termination
if your Account is used inappropriately.
You agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations regarding your membership and use of AOL Services. You
agree to abide by the AOL Community Guidelines and you acknowledge
that AOL has the right to enforce them in its sole discretion. AOL
may take any action against your Account, ranging from a warning
to termination, if you or anyone using your Account violates the
AOL Community Guidelines or any other term of the AOL Terms of
Service. AOL is not required to provide notice prior to
terminating your Account.
You agree to keep confidential the passwords associated with your
Account and passwords that you use with all other AOL Services.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AOL for losses incurred
by AOL or another party due to someone else using your Account or
password as a result of your failure to use reasonable care to
keep your Account information confidential.
6. UNSOLICITED BULK COMMUNICATIONS
You may not use AOL's communication tools, such as e-mail, instant
messaging, voice, fax and chat services to send unsolicited bulk
communications, including through e-mail or instant messages.
Similarly, you may not authorize others to use your Account or
sub-accounts to send unsolicited bulk communications, or cause
unsolicited bulk communications to be sent by someone else. You
may not harvest or collect information about AOL users from AOL
Services, including "screen names", and use that information for
the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk communications. Any
violation of these provisions may result in immediate termination
of your Account and further legal action. You agree that AOL may
take any legal and technical remedies to prevent unsolicited bulk
communications from entering, utilizing or remaining within AOL's
networks.
7. BILLING AND CHARGES
a. Information about charges and fees
AOL charges monthly, in advance, for certain AOL Online Service
subscription plans and other AOL Services. Surcharges apply if you
use certain payment methods (such as payment from your checking
account) or use certain telephone numbers for Internet
connectivity through the AOL Online Service. Additional fees may
apply when you subscribe to other supplemental or enhanced
services. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise
in your subscription plan.
You can go to Keyword: Help, then
selecting Accounts & Billing; go to AOL Keyword: My
Account; or contact an AOL customer service
representative at 1-800-827-6364 to get information about billing
or to determine the status of your bill and the amount of any
surcharge. AOL may, in its discretion, post charges to your
payment method individually or may aggregate your charges with
other purchases you make from AOL.
Any trial promotion for fee-based AOL Services (such as free
trial time for a paid subscription plan to the AOL Online Service)
must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must
cancel your Account before the end of the trial period to avoid
being charged a membership fee. Please note, however, that
even during any free trial or other promotion, you will still be
responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your
Account, sub-accounts, or any new accounts you open or "spin-off"
for any of your sub-accounts.
b. Your payment responsibilities
You must select a payment method to pay AOL for any subscription
fees and all purchases made from AOL . You must give AOL accurate
billing and payment information and keep this information
up-to-date through AOL Keyword: My Account. AOL
will bill you through the payment method that is associated with
your Account. You agree to pay AOL for all charges incurred under
your Account, including all applicable taxes, fees and surcharges.
You authorize AOL to charge your designated payment method for
these charges and to retain information about the payment method
associated with your Account. If AOL does not receive payment from
your designated payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due
upon demand by AOL .
Every time you use an AOL Service, you reaffirm that (i) AOL is
authorized to charge your designated payment method; (ii) AOL may
submit charges incurred under your Account for payment; and (iii)
you will be responsible for such charges, even if your membership
is canceled or terminated.
After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your Account
will be deemed delinquent and AOL may terminate or suspend your
Account for nonpayment. AOL reserves the right to assess an
additional 1.5 percent (or the highest amount allowed by law,
whichever is lower) per month late charge if your payment is more
than 30 days past due and to use alternate means to collect any
unpaid charges. You are liable for any fees, including attorney
and collection fees incurred by AOL in its efforts to collect any
remaining balances from you.
You are responsible for all charges incurred under your
Account, including applicable taxes, fees, surcharges and
purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your Account
(including your children, family or friends).
You must notify AOL about any billing problems or discrepancies
within 90 days after they first appear on your Account statement.
If you do not bring them to AOL's attention within 90 days, you
agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or
discrepancies.
8. COMMUNICATIONS CHARGES
You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining at your expense
all equipment and services needed to access AOL Services. If you
are using AOL 's dial-up Internet connectivity services, you are
responsible for any telephone charges you may incur by accessing
AOL Services. The use of any AOL dial-up Internet connectivity
number is the same as making a telephone call to that number and
thus may result in additional charges on your telephone bill
depending on your location and calling plan. The locations and
area codes listed in connection with these numbers are not
necessarily indicative of whether a call will be local or toll
free for you. You should select your AOL dial-up Internet
connectivity numbers carefully. Please call your local phone
company to ensure that the dial-up number(s) you select will be
local calls for your calling plan. This is especially important if
there have been changes in area code designations, in your
telephone service providers, or in your calling plan. AOL has no
information on whether your use of a particular dial-up Internet
connectivity number will result in phone charges.
You are also responsible for any communications charges you may
incur by accessing AOL Services through a third-party network,
such as a cable or wireless carrier. Your carrier may charge
service fees for alerts, text messaging (including
receiving/sending instant messages and e-mail), web browsing and
other services that require the use of airtime and wireless data
services. Check with your carrier to verify the fees that may
apply to you.
AOL also provides several surcharged 800 or 888 phone numbers to
subscribers of its Internet connectivity services. These numbers
are not toll-free. You agree to pay the applicable surcharge to
AOL if you choose to use these surcharged numbers. Information on
the amount of this surcharge and on available dial-up phone
numbers is located at AOL Keyword: Access. Note
that you can incur long-distance or toll charges or surcharges for
800 or 888 phone numbers even during your free trial.
9. CHANGES TO THE SERVICE
AOL in its sole discretion may change or discontinue any or all
aspects of the AOL Services without notice, including access to
support services, Content and other products or services ancillary
to the AOL Services or an AOL membership.
AOL may modify the AOL Terms of Service, change its fees and
change its billing methods at any time. AOL will provide you with
notice of any change in pricing or material changes to the Terms
of Service at least thirty (30) days in advance. If you disagree
with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your
membership before such change takes effect. Otherwise, you will be
bound by the revised terms if you keep your membership. AOL will
not refund any charges if you choose to cancel your membership for
this reason.
For certain subscription plans, AOL reserves the right to log off
accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time and you
may not use tools that defeat AOL's automatic log-off feature.
10. CONTENT
a. Your Use of Content as an AOL Member
AOL, its Suppliers and its members who lawfully post Content on
AOL Services own the property rights to that Content. The Content
is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret,
international treaties, laws and other proprietary rights, and
also may have security components that protect digital information
only as authorized by AOL or Supplier. You agree that you will not
take any action to interfere with AOL's or its Suppliers'
ownership of or rights in the Content and you will not attempt to
circumvent any mechanisms for preventing the unauthorized
reproduction or distribution of the Content.
You may use any Content available on the AOL Services, but only
for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may be given the
opportunity to download certain Content such as music and photos,
but you may do so only to the extent as authorized for that
particular Content and only for your personal use. You may not use
the Content in a manner that exceeds the rights granted for your
use of the Content, which includes unauthorized copying or
distribution of the Content or creating an unauthorized derivative
work.
b. Content You Post
You may only post Content that you created or which you have been
given permission to post by the owner of the Content. You may not
post or distribute Content that is illegal or that violates the
AOL Community Guidelines. By posting or submitting Content on any
AOL Service, you represent and warrant that (i) you own all the
rights to this Content or are authorized to use and distribute
this Content on the AOL Services and (ii) this Content does not
and will not infringe any copyright or any other third-party right
nor violate any applicable law or regulation.
Although you or the owner of the Content retain ownership of all
right, title, and interest in Content that you post to any AOL
Service, AOL owns all right, title, and interest in any
compilation, collective work or other derivative work created by
AOL using or incorporating this Content. In addition, by posting
Content on an AOL Service, you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates,
subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable,
perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform,
distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium.
c. Content on the AOL Services or the Internet
AOL is not required to pre-screen Content available on the AOL
Services, although AOL reserves the right to do so in its sole
discretion. AOL is not liable for Content that is provided by
others. AOL reserves the right to remove Content that, in its sole
judgment, does not meet its standards or does not comply with the
AOL Community Guidelines, but AOL is not responsible for any
failure or delay in removing such material. AOL is not responsible
for content available on the Internet, although AOL reserves the
right to block access to any Internet area containing illegal or
other harmful content being used for purposes that are unlawful or
injurious to AOL or its members. You acknowledge that third-party
sites on the Internet may have their own terms and conditions that
govern your use of those sites.
d. Exporting of Content or Software
You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control
laws and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise,
any Content or Software subject to restrictions under such laws to
a national destination prohibited under such laws, or to any
person or entity prohibited under such laws, without first
obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government
authorization. You further agree not to upload to AOL any data or
software that cannot be exported without prior written government
authorization and notification of AOL , including, but not limited
to, certain types of encryption software. This assurance and
commitment shall survive termination of this Member Agreement.
11. LICENSE
AOL and the Suppliers grant you a personal, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, limited license to install the Software on any
computer or device from which you wish to access the AOL Services
and to use the Software to connect to and use the AOL Services in
accordance with this Member Agreement. AOL occasionally will
provide automatic Software and technology upgrades to improve your
member experience, such as virus and spam screening technologies,
although these upgrades may not be consistent across all platforms
and devices. You agree to accept and to take no action to
interfere with such automatic upgrades, scanning, and related
services. Also, the Software may be subject to a license agreement
that accompanies the Software.
You may only use the Software to access and use AOL Services. You
may not copy the Software except to install it on your computer or
other devices. You may not sell the Software or incorporate it (or
any portion of it) into another product. You may not reverse
engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or otherwise
attempt to derive the source code (except where expressly
permitted by law). You may not obtain the communications protocol
for accessing AOL Services unless expressly authorized by AOL. You
may not modify, adapt or create derivative works from the Software
in any way or remove proprietary notices in the Software. You
agree to abide by all laws and regulations in effect regarding
your use of the Software and the AOL Services. Finally, you may
not authorize or assist any third party to do any of the things
described in this paragraph.
The Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end
users acquire the Software with only those rights set forth
herein.
12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
YOUR USE OF AOL SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND THE INTERNET IS AT YOUR
SOLE RISK. THE AOL SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS,"
"WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH
WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. SPECIFICALLY, AOL
AND THE SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT THE AOL
SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE MERCHANTABLE, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
ACCURATE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGING.
AOL AND THE SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED
IN THE SOFTWARE OR AOL SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR AOL SERVICES WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE OR
AOL SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. AOL AND THE SUPPLIERS DO NOT
WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE
RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, AOL SERVICES, OR RELATED
DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY,
RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR
ADVICE GIVEN BY AOL OR AN AOL AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL
CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS
WARRANTY. AOL PROVIDES THE AOL SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ON A
COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT MEMBERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE AOL SERVICES (EITHER DIRECTLY OR
THROUGH THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS) AT TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF THEIR
CHOOSING, OR THAT AOL WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR THE AOL
SERVICES AS A WHOLE OR IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA.
13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
AOL'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO
THE USE OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED OR USED BY AOL SHALL BE THE
REPLACEMENT OF ANY AOL SOFTWARE FOUND TO BE DEFECTIVE. YOUR SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY OTHER DISPUTE WITH AOL IS THE
CANCELLATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT AS DETAILED BELOW IN SECTION 15. IN
NO EVENT SHALL AOL'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS RELATING TO THE USE OF THE AOL SERVICES EXCEED THE TOTAL
AMOUNT OF SERVICE FEES THAT YOU PAID DURING A ONE-YEAR PERIOD FOR
THE SPECIFIC AOL SERVICE AT ISSUE.
AOL AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGE ARISING
FROM YOUR USE OF THE AOL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, THE INTERNET OR FOR
ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP WITH AOL.
THESE EXCLUSIONS FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF AOL HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND
REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY UPON WHICH THE CLAIM
IS BASED. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, AOL AND ITS
SUPPLIER'S LIABILITY IN SUCH STATE OR JURISDICTION SHALL BE
LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. EXCEPT FOR OFFERS
EXPRESSLY MADE OR GUARANTEED BY AOL, AOL AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT
ENDORSE, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED
THROUGH AOL AND WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND
THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
14. INDEMNIFICATION
Upon a request by AOL, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless AOL and its Suppliers from all liabilities, claims and
expenses, including attorneys' fees, that arise from a breach of
the AOL Terms of Service for which you are responsible or from the
use of AOL Services or the Internet, or in connection with your
transmission of any Content on AOL Services. AOL reserves the
right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.
In that event, you shall have no further obligation to provide
indemnification for AOL in that matter.
15. TERMINATION
Either you may cancel or AOL may terminate your membership or
subscription to an AOL Service at any time. You can cancel a
fee-based subscription plan for use of the AOL Online Service by
calling, by sending a fax, or by sending a letter to AOL 's
Customer Service Department. Cancellation will take effect within
72 hours of receipt of your request. Complete information on AOL
's cancellation procedures is available at AOL® Keyword: Cancel, or, on the Internet, go to http://changeplan.aol.com/. AOL will send you written
confirmation of the cancellation of your fee-based subscription
plan to the AOL Online Service. If you cancel near the end of your
billing period and are inadvertently charged for the next month's
fee, call AOL to have the charges reversed. If you signed up for
certain supplemental or enhanced services for an extra fee (such
as AOL Music Now), you should consult the specific cancellation
policies and procedures for those services. If your membership or
subscription to AOL Services is canceled or terminated, including
based on inactivity in your use of a free service, any data you
have stored on such AOL Services may not be retrieved later.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 13 above, cancellation of
your Account is your sole right and remedy with respect to any
dispute with AOL . This includes, but is not limited to, any
dispute related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Member
Agreement or AOL 's enforcement or application of this Member
Agreement; (2) any policy or practice of AOL , including AOL 's
Community Guidelines and the AOL Privacy Policy, or AOL 's
enforcement or application of these policies; (3) the Content
available on AOL Services or the Internet or any change in Content
provided by AOL ; (4) your ability to access and/or use the AOL
Services; or (5) the amount or type of fees, surcharges,
applicable taxes, billing methods, or any change to the fees,
applicable taxes, surcharges or billing methods.
In the event that your Account is terminated or canceled, no
online time or other credits will be credited to you or can be
converted to cash or other form of reimbursement. You understand
and agree that you no longer will have access to any of the AOL
Services associated with your deactivated Screen Name or Account.
AOL must give you express permission before it will reactivate you
Account if AOL previously terminated your membership for violating
the AOL Terms of Service (including its Community Guidelines) or
due to an outstanding balance. Active AOL members may not allow
former AOL members whose memberships have been terminated to use
their Accounts.
16. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS
This Member Agreement, as published over the AOL Online Service,
the terms of your subscription plan provided at registration and
billing terms posted on the AOL Online Service constitute the
entire and only agreement regarding your AOL membership and your
Account. This Member Agreement supersedes all representations,
agreements and other communications regarding your membership.
Only AOL can amend this Member Agreement by posting the changes on
the AOL Online Service. If any term of this Member Agreement is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the term shall be considered to be stricken from
this Member Agreement as if it had not been included from the
beginning and the remainder of the Member Agreement enforced
according to its terms.
You agree that this Member Agreement is not intended to confer and
does not confer any rights or remedies from AOL upon any person
other than you. You also agree that the AOL Community Guidelines
and other guidelines posted on AOL Services, including AOL 's
enforcement of those policies, are not intended to confer, and do
not confer, any rights or remedies upon any person.
The AOL Online Service and AOL Services are provided by AOL LLC
and its affiliates.
a. Choice of Law; Choice of Forum
The laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding its
conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Member Agreement, your
membership, and your use of AOL Services. You expressly agree that
exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with AOL or
relating in any way to your membership, this Member Agreement, or
your use of the AOL Services resides in the courts of Virginia and
you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of
personal jurisdiction in the courts of Virginia in connection with
any such dispute including any claim involving AOL or AOL
Services. The foregoing provision may not apply to you depending
on the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement shall not be
governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods.
b. Electronic Delivery Policy and Your Consent

e-mail to your primary screen name, and/or (ii) by "pop up notice"

page or channel page of the relevant service. You agree that
certain supplemental or enhanced services made available to AOL
members may also have their own Notice procedures.

membership, including any Notices concerning violations of any
sub-accounts, to your primary screen name.

communications source (telephone, wireless or broadband), a
Windows-based operating system with AOL Software version 2.5 or
higher, or a Macintosh-based operating system with AOL Software
for Macintosh in order to access electronic communications. You
will need a printer attached to your personal computer to print
any Notices. You can retrieve an electronic copy and a printable
version of the AOL Terms of Service at AOL Keyword: TOS. The delivery of any Notice from AOL is
effective when sent by AOL, regardless of whether you read the
communication when you receive it. You may withdraw your consent
to receive notices electronically by calling or by sending a fax
or letter to AOL's Customer Service at the address and phone
number listed at AOL® Keyword: Cancel, or, on the Internet, go to http://changeplan.aol.com/; however, if you choose to
withdraw consent, AOL may terminate your membership and
subscriptions to any AOL Services. All registrations, agreements,
and terms will be completed electronically and will be deemed for
all legal purposes to be in writing and legally enforceable as a
signed writing.
