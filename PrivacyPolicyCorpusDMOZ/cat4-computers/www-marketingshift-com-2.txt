Apple iPhone Legal Notice and Privacy Policies
I have always enjoyed reading through privacy policies, terms of service and general legal docs web sites use to tell you what they're going to do with your data. When the iPhone came out, one of the first things I did was go into settings > general > about
> legal and read through all of the fine print. The information in there is quite amazing. I mean, they tell you who's software they're licensing for the iPhone, what companies they have partnered with, which fonts they are using (Helvetica anyone?), the terms offer us a plethora of insight that any reverse engineering biz dev guy would love. Today's terms of service and privacy policy docs read like a playbook for creating competing products and web sites. They tell you who to partner with, show you which partnerships have a stranglehold on your competitor and so much more.I wanted to post the entire contents of the Apple iPhone terms document back when they released the 1st iPhone but they didn't have a way to email or copy the entire agreement to get it off of my iPhone. Well, thanks to the new
cut-n-paste feature in iPhone 3.x OS, we can now do just that. So for those of you who want to know who Apple went to bed with, here are the entire contents of the iPhone, enjoy. P.S. I have bolded all company names, registered trademarks (except for those owned by Apple) and copyrights so you can see who Apple partnered with and why.Legal Notices:Copyright © 1983-2009 Apple Inc.

In addition, the following describes our mobile privacy practices. For a web version of this and other Google privacy policies, please go to www.google.com/privacy.html.Mobile-specific information we collect* Most of the personally identifying information we collect is what you tell us about yourself. For example, certain of our products and services allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. You choose what you want to share and how you want to share it.* Sometimes, we record your phone number. We record your phone number when you send it to us; ask us to remember it; or make a call or send a text message or SMS to or from Google. If you ask us to remember your phone number, we will associate your phone number with your Google Account, or, if you do not have a Google Account, with some other similar account ID. We often generate this account ID based on your device and hardware IDs, so if you change your device or hardware, you will have to re-associate this new device or hardware with your account before we can authenticate you.* Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your device and hardware IDs and device type, the request type, your carrier, your carrier user ID, and the content of your request, does not by itself identify you to Google, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.* If you use location-based products and services, such as Google Maps for mobile, you may be sending us location information. This information may reveal your actual location, such as GPS data, or it may not, such as when you submit a partial address to look at a map of the area.* Certain of our products and services allow you to personalize the content you receive from us. For these products and services, we will record your preferences and any information you provide about yourself or your interests (such as a list of your stocks to personalize your stock listings).* If you use Google to transcode, or format, non-mobile pages to display properly on your device, we need to send your request to Google's servers for formatting. That means that we will record these requests, which are generally for material beyond Google's sites.Uses (aka: how Google uses the information they glean from you)* We use your information to process and personalize your requests. We also use the information for support, to develop new features, and to improve the overall quality of Google's products and services.* We may also use the information to show you a history of your activity, to provide you with statistics about you or your use of our product or service, or to provide you with a better user experience.* If you purchase something through Google, we may also use your information to bill you and to handle billing disputes.Information sharing and onward transfer* All requests must be sent through your mobile carrier's network and your carrier may have access to it. For information regarding your carrier's treatment of your information, please consult your carrier's privacy policies.* We may share your information with certain third parties we use to perform certain functions, such as billing and text message or SMS delivery. These third parties will be contractually bound to treat your information in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies.* Certain of our products and services allow you to interact and share your information with others. Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information or data that might be accessible to others.Your choices (do we really have a choice Google?)* Certain of our products and services allow you to opt-out of certain information gathering and sharing or to opt-out of certain products, services, or features. Each product has a help page which describes these and other options.More informationGoogle adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the Department of Commerce's web site. Further information about Google's various mobile products and services is available at mobile.google.com. For more information about our privacy practices, go to the full privacy policy.

(FSF).Parts of this software include the libgcc and libstdc++ libraries owned by the FSF. You may obtain a complete machine-readable copy of the source code for the FSF software under the terms of GNU General Public License (GPL) with libgcc exception and GPL plus libstdc++ exception, without charge except for the cost of media, shipping, and handling, upon written request to Apple. The FSF software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GPL for more details; a copy of the GPL is included below.GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 2, June 1991Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.PreambleThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The Program, below, refers to any such program or work, and a work based on the Program means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term modification.) Each licensee is addressed as you.Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any

Wow!
That list is a lot longer than I thought.
I too enjoy reading policies and procedures, but that was crazy!
Thanks for sharing though.
