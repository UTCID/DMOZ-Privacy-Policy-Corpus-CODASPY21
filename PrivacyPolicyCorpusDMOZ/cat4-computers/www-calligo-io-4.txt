Privacy by Design Consultancy
Let every process, idea or ambition be born from a solid legal and ethical base, that never obstructs progress or performance
Speak to a data privacy consultant
What is Privacy by Design?
7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design was launched in 2010 by Dr Ann Cavoukian, the Information and Privacy Commissioner for Ontario, and has since become the accepted standard for the privacy industry - legislators and practitioners alike.
In any situation where personal data is processed, Data Privacy ought to:
Be preventative, not remedial
Be the default
Be embedded into process design
Allow full functionality, not be obstructive
Entail full end-to-end data security
Be visible, transparent and communicated
Put the data subject first

Benefits of Privacy by Design
Navigate legal liability
Implementing Privacy by Design frameworks is the ultimate sign of an organization wanting to ensure their data interactions are ethical and legitimate, which can be a key mitigating factor with Supervisory Authorities
Maintain continuous compliance
Privacy by Design underpins wider data privacy programmes and their objectives of continuous adherence, especially as most national and industry-specific privacy frameworks are also based on its principles
Safe growth and innovation
An organization whose data lifecycles and interactions are already built on the fundamentals of data privacy can be confident that any data-driven innovation is inherently safe, adherent and legal
Earn and preserve customer confidence
Organizations that have implemented Privacy by Design principles will engage with their audience differently to those that have not, and will inspire trust and confidence, and even leniancy in the case of a breach
Improved incident response
The Privacy by Design principles ensure that stakeholders are engaged, data flows are visible and communication channels are open, which is a natural foundation for responding to any breach
