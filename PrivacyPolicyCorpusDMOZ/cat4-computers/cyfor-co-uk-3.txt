2.2 Each order will be deemed to be an offer by the Customer to purchase the Services upon these Conditions. A Contract is formed when the order is accepted by the Supplier by way of written acknowledgement of order or by commencement of the Services. No Contract will come into existence until a written acknowledgement of order is issued by the Supplier or until the Supplier commences the provision of the Services, whichever occurs earlier.
2.3 Quotations are given by the Supplier on the basis that no Contract shall come into existence except in accordance with Condition 2.2. Any Quotation is valid for a period of 30 days from its date, provided that the Supplier has not previously withdrawn it. The Supplier reserves the right to withdraw or revise a Quotation at any time prior to accepting the order from the Customer.
3 Supplier’s obligations
3.1 The Supplier shall provide the Services and deliver the Deliverables to the Customer.
3.2 The dates mentioned in a Contract and/or any Quotation and/or any order are approximate only and time will not be of the essence as to any performance of the Services and/or delivery of the Deliverables, but the Supplier will use reasonable efforts to fulfil its obligations under a Contract in a timely manner. Additionally, the Supplier will not be liable for any delay in performing the Services and/or delivering the Deliverables that results from any delay or other failure by the Customer in providing any Exhibits and/or Documents and/or other information as may be required by the Contract.
3.3 The Services supplied under a Contract shall continue to be supplied until, in the opinion of the Supplier, the project is completed or until the relevant Contract is terminated in accordance with Condition 11.
3.4 The Supplier shall provide the Services from such premises as it deems appropriate from time to time.
3.5 Where the Services include data hosting on a review platform (“Hosting”) the Supplier shall grant such licences to the Customer as may be necessary for the Customer’s use of the Services and the Supplier shall be entitled to suspend any such licences (without refund) in the event that they are not used within any 7 day period.
3.6 The Services shall be provided during Normal Working Hours and any support services agreed to be undertaken by the Supplier as part of the Services shall take place during Normal Support Hours. In the event that any additional support is required outside the Normal Support Hours, such support shall be provided at the Supplier’s standard rate, as notified to the Customer from time to time.
3.7 The Supplier shall use reasonable endeavours to make the Services, including Hosting, available during Normal Working Hours except for emergency or essential systems maintenance, provided that, where reasonably practicable, the Supplier shall give to the Customer at least 1 hours’ notice in advance.
3.8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Supplier does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error free.
3.9 The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Supplier is only able to provide the Services based on the information and documents disclosed to it and the Supplier shall not be responsible for any errors when undertaking work on the Customer’s behalf. It is the Customer’s responsibility to check all Deliverables produced by the Supplier
3.10 The Supplier will, and usually only if requested to, by the Customer, conduct a Conflict Check. This Conflict Check is conducted on a best endeavours basis and will be conducted using information provided to it by the Customer. The Customer warrants that it will ensure the information it provides to the Supplier is free of errors and indemnifies the Supplier and its agents against any errors or omissions howsoever caused. CYFOR provides no warranties and accepts no liability whatsoever should a conflict be identified at any stage.
3.11 The supplier shall not provide any advice to the vendor party or any other third party in connection with the Services without prior consent of the Customer
3.12 The Supplier shall consult the Customer’s legal counsel prior to finalising advice, information, or any reports to the Customer in writing. Any advice, information, or reports that the Supplier provides shall be legally privileged and shall be provided to the Customer’s legal counsel.
4 Customer’s obligations
4.1 The Customer shall (and to the extent necessary to enable the Supplier to perform the Services, shall procure that its client (“Client”) shall):
(a) co-operate with the Supplier in all matters relating to the Services and/or Deliverables;
(b) provide such access to the Customer’s and/or the Client’s premises and data, and such office accommodation and other facilities as may reasonably be required by the Supplier for the purposes of the Services and/or Deliverables;
(c) provide such access to appropriate numbers of the Customer’s and/or the Client’s suitably qualified personnel as may reasonably be required by the Supplier for the purposes of the Services and/or Deliverables (including without limitation, the provision of personnel to assist with the extraction of data from network or email servers and assist the Supplier in respect of complex IT infrastructures);
(d) provide or facilitate the provision of the Exhibits; and warrants that they and the client (“Client”) have the lawful and legal right to provide or grant access to the Exhibits for the purposes of this or any other Contract;
(e) provide in a timely manner such other information as the Supplier may request (or which the Customer and/or the Client knows or ought reasonably to have known that the Supplier would require) in order to carry out the Services and/or deliver the Deliverables, and ensure that it is accurate in all material respects; and
(f) inform the Supplier of all health and safety rules and regulations and any other reasonable security requirements that apply at any of the Customer’s and/or the Client’s premises.
5 Change, Variation and Extension to the scope
5.1 If either party wishes to change the scope or execution of the Services and/or Deliverables, it shall submit details of the requested change to the other in writing.
5.2 If the Customer requests a change to the scope or execution of the Services and/or Deliverables:
(a) the Supplier shall, within a reasonable time (and in any event not more than five Working Days after receipt of the Customer’s request), provide a written estimate to the Customer of:
(i) the likely time required to implement the change;
(ii) any necessary variations to the Supplier’s charges arising from the change; and
(iii) any other impact of the change on the terms of the Contract.
(b) if the Customer does not wish to proceed, there shall be no change to the Contract; and
(c) if the Customer wishes the Supplier to proceed with the change, the Supplier shall do so after agreement on the necessary variations to its charges, the Services, the Deliverables and any other relevant terms of the Contract to take account of the change and the Contract shall be varied in accordance with Condition 13.
5.3 If the Supplier requests a change to the scope of the Services and/or Deliverables (whereupon to the extent the Supplier deems it appropriate, it shall provide the Customer with the information set out at Condition 5.2(a)), the Customer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to it. If the Customer wishes the Supplier to proceed with the change, the Supplier shall do so after agreement on the necessary variations to its charges, the Services, Deliverables and any other relevant terms of the Contract to take account of the change and the Contract shall be varied in accordance with Condition 13.
5.4 In the event that the Customer requires an extension and/or variance to the scope of the Services and/or Deliverables (whether requested by the Customer or reasonably deemed to be necessary by the Supplier) and due to time constraints or other factors, it is impractical for the procedure set out Condition 5.2 to be followed then, upon acceptance (whether by communicating such acceptance or by commencing its performance) of such extension by the Supplier the Contract shall be varied in accordance with Condition 13 and the Supplier’s standard rates as set out in the Quotation shall apply in respect of the additional Services and/or Deliverables.
6 Charges and payment
6.1 Invoices will be raised as agreed and/or at appropriate intervals. For the avoidance of doubt, Invoices will be addressed to the Customer (the entity to whom the Quotation was addressed) who will be responsible for Payment under the Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the Customer cannot be made without the Suppliers express permission and the provision of a new Quotation, after work has commenced in accordance with the Quotation or after an invoice has been raised.
6.2 Subject to Conditions 6.3 and 6.4, the total price for the provision of the Services and delivery of the Deliverables shall be the amount set out in the Quotation as amended in accordance with any scope extension, variance or changes as set out in Condition 5. The supplier will amend the Invoice and/or reissue an invoice to reflect any errors or omissions as appropriate in the Quotation.
6.3 The Supplier’s charges exclude the cost of hotels, subsistence, travelling and any other ancillary expenses reasonably and properly incurred by the Supplier in connection with the Services and/or Deliverables, and the costs of any materials or services reasonably and properly provided by third parties that are required by the Supplier for the supply of the Services and/or Deliverables. Such expenses, materials and third party services shall be invoiced by the Supplier at cost price plus an administration charge of 5% of the total amount provided they have been agreed in advance with the customer.
6.4 The Supplier may at any time:
(a) withdraw any discount from its normal prices; and
(b) revise prices to take account of increases in costs including, without limitation, the cost of any goods, raw materials, transport, labour or overheads, the increase or imposition of any tax, duty or other levy and any variation in exchange rates; and
(c) revise prices to take account of increases in costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances (including unforeseen technical difficulties with respect to the Services, difficulties with extracting data from network or email servers, the nature of the work (including value), time spent, urgency, a greater number of Exhibits being the subject of the Services than was contemplated in the Quotation and/or increases in the data size contemplated in the Quotation and the other factors which may also be taken into consideration when arriving at our fees) and/or an extension of the scope of Services and/or Deliverables in accordance with Condition 5.
6.5 In the event that the Supplier has commenced the provision of the Services and subsequently the Customer no longer requires the Services (whether in accordance with its Clients’ instructions or otherwise), the Customer shall inform the Supplier of this in writing as soon as possible and the Customer shall be liable to pay the greater of 50% of the total price of the Services or the price payable for the Services provided by the Supplier to the Customer as at the date the Customer notifies the Supplier in writing that it no longer requires the Services.
6.6 The Supplier shall (if applicable) add to the price for the Services, and the Customer shall pay an amount equal to any VAT or other sales tax or duty applicable from time to time to the sale or supply of such Services.
6.7 Without prejudice to Condition 6.3, the Supplier reserves the right to invoice the Customer for the estimated charges set out in the Quotation prior to commencing the provision of the Services (and shall do so in any event where the Services include an international element). If the Customer fails to pay the Supplier in accordance with this Condition 6, the Supplier reserves the right to not commence the provision of the Services until such time as the Customer has paid the Supplier in accordance with this Condition 6. To the extent that the total charges for providing the Services and Deliverables:
(a) are greater than the estimated charges set out in the Quotation, the Supplier shall be entitled to invoice the Customer (at any time) for the excess charges and the Customer shall make all payments due the Supplier in accordance with this Condition 6; or
(b) are less than the estimated charges set out in the Quotation, the Supplier shall reimburse the Customer within 30 days of the completion of the provision of the Services and Deliverables.
6.8 The Customer shall make all payments due to the Supplier under any Contract immediately upon receipt of the relevant invoice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer shall be responsible for all payments to the Supplier, regardless of the Customer’s arrangements with its clients.
6.9 In the event that the Customer requires funding from the Legal Aid Authority, or any other similar organisation or authorised third-party funder, so as to make the payments due to the Supplier under Condition 6.7, the Customer agrees that it shall:
(a) (where it is possible to do so) apply for prior authority for the Quoted value of Services and promptly notify the Supplier of the result of such application;
(b) (where it is possible to do so) apply for interim payment in respect of the Services;
(c) apply for such funding immediately upon receipt of the invoice from the Supplier;
(d) provide confirmation to the Supplier that such application has been made; and
(e) make all payments due to the Supplier immediately upon receiving funding.
(f) separate funds received from the Legal Aid Authority or any third party funder from its own working capital funds in order that these are not considered to be funds belonging to the Customer in the event of insolvency or administration
(f) make all payments due to the Supplier within 30 days of the date of the invoice
For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer assumes all responsibility for making the payments due to the Supplier under Condition 6.7, irrespective of whether or not the Customer requires funding pursuant to Condition 6.8 and payment of the Supplier’s fees shall not be contingent upon such funding being obtained by the Customer.
6.10 Without prejudice to Condition 6.11, time of payment is of the essence of each Contract and the Supplier reserves the right to suspend the provision of Services and delivery of Deliverables to the Customer where any amounts are overdue under any Contract until all such amounts have been paid in full.
6.11 Where Services have been suspended in accordance with 6.9 and the Suspension of Services includes Hosting, a reconnection fee will apply. Such fee will be notified to the Customer, by the Supplier, in advance of the Suspension of Services.
6.12 Without prejudice to Condition 6.9, where the Services include Hosting, charges for such Hosting will continue and accrue in accordance with the estimate until the contract is Terminated, or notification is received in accordance with 11.5.
6.13 Without Prejudice to condition 6.15, the supplier reserves the right to raise an administration invoice to the Supplier for late payment of invoices. The administration fee will be notified to the Customer in advance but, in any event, will not be less then £50.
6.14 The Customer is not entitled to withhold payment of any amount due to the Supplier by way of any set-off or counterclaim.
6.15 If the Customer fails to pay any amount due to the Supplier under any Contract on the due date, notwithstanding the provisions of Condition 6.8, the Supplier reserves the right to add interest to such amount at the rate of 8% over the base rate for the time being of The Bank of England for the period from the due date until and including the date of receipt (whether before or after judgment).
6.16 Without prejudice to the Supplier’s other rights and remedies, if the Customer fails to pay any amount due to the Supplier under any Contract on the due date, the Supplier shall be entitled, upon notification to the Customer, to remove the Customer’s data (and Exhibits) and destroy or permanently erase the same.
6.17 The Supplier reserves the right to alter or withdraw at any time any credit allowed to the Customer.
6.18 The Supplier may offset any amount owing to it from the Customer against any amount owed to the Customer by the Supplier.
7 Quality of Services
7.1 The Supplier warrants that the Services will be performed (and the Deliverables provided) with reasonable care and skill and that the Services will for a period of 30 days from performance substantially conform with any descriptions and specifications provided to the Customer by the Supplier.
7.2 The warranties in Condition 7.1 are given on the following conditions:
(a) the Supplier is not liable for any defect in the Services (or Deliverables) caused by any act, neglect or default of the Customer or a third party; and
(b) the Supplier is not liable for a defect in the Services (or Deliverables) unless it is notified to the Supplier in writing within 7 Working Days of the date of performance or, if the defect would not be apparent upon reasonable inspection, within 60 days of the date of performance.
7.3 The Supplier is not liable for non-performance of any Services unless the Customer notifies the Supplier of the claim within 7 Working Days of the date of the alleged non-performance.
8 Intellectual Property Rights
8.1 The Supplier acquires title in and to all of the Intellectual Property Rights arising as a result of the Supplier performing the Services along with all other rights in and to the products of the Services (including the Deliverables) (“Services IPR”). Subject to receipt by the Supplier of payment in full of all amounts due under the Contract and subject to Condition 11, the Supplier hereby grants to the Customer a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Services IPR solely for the purpose of receiving the benefit of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt this refers to the processes themselves and not the data.
8.2 Save for the rights granted pursuant to Condition 8.1, the Customer shall not acquire any right, title, and/or interest in and to the Services IPR whether by virtue of the Contract or otherwise.
9 Exclusion of Liability
9.1 The Supplier does not exclude its liability (if any) to the Customer:

ii. any breach by the Supplier of any terms of the Contract; or
iii. any statement made or not made, or advice given or not given, by or on behalf of the Supplier, or otherwise in connection with the Services or Deliverables.
9.3 Except as set out in Condition 9.1, the Supplier hereby excludes to the fullest extent permissible in law, all conditions, warranties and stipulations, express (other than those set out in these Conditions) or implied, statutory, customary or otherwise which, but for such exclusion, would or might subsist in favour of the Customer.
9.4 Each of the Supplier’s personnel, agents and sub-contractors may rely upon and enforce the exclusions and restrictions of liability in Conditions 9.2 and 9.3 in that person’s own name and for that person’s own benefit, as if the words “its personnel, agents and sub-contractors” followed the word “Supplier” wherever it appears in those Conditions.
9.5 Subject to Conditions 9.1 and 9.2, the entire liability of the Supplier arising out of or in connection with the Contract or supply, non supply or delay in supplying any of the Services or Deliverables, or otherwise in connection with the Services or Deliverables, whether in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty) or otherwise, is limited to the price of the Contract.
9.6 The Customer acknowledges that the above provisions in Conditions 9.1 to 9.5 and this Condition 9.6 are reasonable and reflected in the price which would be higher without those provisions, and the Customer will accept such risk and/or insure accordingly.
10 Confidentiality
10.1 In this Condition 10, “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed (whether in writing, orally or by another means and whether directly or indirectly) by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”) whether before or after the date of the Contract including, but not limited to, information relating to the Disclosing Party’s products, operations, processes, plans or intentions, product information, know-how, Intellectual Property Rights, trade secrets, market opportunities and/or business affairs.

(d) is required to be disclosed by law, but then only to the extent so required.
11 Termination

11.2 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which may arise, the Supplier may terminate the Contract immediately on giving notice if:
(a) the Customer commits a material breach of any of the terms of the Contract and, where the breach is remediable, fails to remedy that breach within 14 days of being notified in writing of the breach; or
(b) an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up of the Customer, or circumstances arise which entitle a court of competent jurisdiction to make a winding up order of the Customer; or
(c) an order is made for the appointment of an administrator to manage the affairs, business and property of the Customer, or documents are filed with a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an administrator of the Customer, or notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given by the Customer or its directors or by a qualifying floating charge holder (as defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986); or

11.6 Termination of the Contract, however it arises, shall not affect or prejudice the accrued rights of the parties as at termination or the continuation of any provision expressly stated to survive, or implicitly surviving termination. For the avoidance of doubt, upon termination of the Contract the licence granted pursuant to Condition 8.1 shall terminate.
12 Erasing of Data
12.1 In the event that Data Erasure is undertaken as part of this Contract whether by way of termination of the Contract or as part of a provided Service, the Customer will use industry standard techniques specifically designed for this purpose.
12.2 The Supplier will ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that all Data from it’s normal operating systems, including any independent archives, is securely erased and irretrievable. The supplier is not able to erase Data from media that is used for the purposes of its Infrastructure Backup and Disaster Recovery purposes. As these archives are superseded, previous Archives will be securely Erased and ultimately the Data will be securely erased.
