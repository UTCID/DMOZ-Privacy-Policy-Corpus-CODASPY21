CIRA will not, under any circumstances, be liable to you or any other person for any loss or damage arising from, connected with, or relating to the use of CDRDs by you or any other person.

Further, translations of CDRDs have been prepared for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to be relied upon as advice on any particular matter. If you want to rely upon a translated CDRD, you should obtain your own certified translation from a qualified interpreter or translator. CIRA will indicate on each translated decision that it is provided for convenience only.
