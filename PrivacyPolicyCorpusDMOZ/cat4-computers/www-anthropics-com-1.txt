Your rights
Your privacy is protected by law.
We are only allowed to use personal data if we have a lawful reason to do so.
We must have one or more of the following reasons:
When we have a legal duty.
To fulfil a contract with you.
When it is in our legitimate interests, the data processing is necessary to achieve those interests and our interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
With your consent.
You have various rights in relation to our use of your data:
You have the right to ask us to correct personal data we hold about you.
In many cases, you have the right to ask us to delete data held about you.
In cases where we are relying on your consent to process data, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
Where we are relying on our legitimate interests to process data, you have the right to object to such processing.
We will then only process data if there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms.
This will never apply if the processing is for direct marketing purposes.
You have the right to access the personal data we hold about you, and information about the processing we perform with that data.
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.
