SNIA Events Attendee Policy
Out of an abundance of caution, we are asking all of our event attendees to follow CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and WHO (World Health Organization) coronavirus guidelines. As such, we ask that anyone that travels (or is in close contact with someone that travels) to or from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Italy or US hot zones as they are identified (or transits through airports at these locations) or have been within 2 meters (approx. six feet) for 30 minutes or more of anyone confirmed to be sick with the Coronavirus in the 3 weeks prior to April 20th event, please do not attend in person the SNIA Symposium. Expect additional screening based on these criteria when you check-into the event. Remote participation options (Zoom or equivalent/phone) will be provided for these SNIA industry meetings.
SNIA’s restrictions above are based on evolving US Government restrictions and Storage Industry Company travel policies/restrictions, and are subject to updates/change. If any of the above applies to you, or if you are from a country/company which does not comply with these restrictions, you should NOT attend this event in person (remote participation options should be used and indicated on the event RSVP/Registration).
This is the time of year when many are susceptible to the common cold and flu. As a general precaution, if you are showing symptoms (fever, cough, etc), otherwise feeling ill, we ask that you do not attend in person until you are symptom and fever-free for 48 hours without fever-reducing medications.
Travelers should account for additional time required for health and temperature screenings at transport hubs and should check regularly for changes in travel guidance.
We will continue to monitor the situation for any significant changes and will send out an update immediately if there are material changes to the event status noted above.
