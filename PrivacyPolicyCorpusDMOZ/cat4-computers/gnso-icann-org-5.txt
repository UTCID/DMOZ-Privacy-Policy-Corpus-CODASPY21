Quick Info
Last Updated: 19 March 2019The Quick Info page is an one-stop-shop with all the relevant information that the GNSO and the wider ICANN community may need to participate effectively in policy development and stay informed about GNSO activities. ICANN Policy staff in support of the GNSO tailored the information to the various users that may take advantage of this page and hope that this centralized information page will provide useful quick links to GNSO-related documents and web-pages that might otherwise be more difficult to find. We consider this page a first step and are keen to develop it further depending on comments and feedback – so please let us know what you think.
