herein. Your use of MVIZ Sites constitutes agreement with such Terms.
Before using MVIZ Sites, please carefully read this agreement relating
to your use of MVIZ Sites.
By using MVIZ Sites, you agree to be bound
by these terms and conditions.
If you do not agree to these terms and
conditions, please do not use MVIZ Sites.
MVIZ reserves the right, at MVIZ's sole discretion, to change,
modify, add or remove portions of these Terms periodically.
Such
modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the
modified agreement to the website unless provided otherwise (e.g.,
when implementing major, substantive changes, MVIZ intends to provide
users with up to fourteen days of advance notice).
Your continued use
of the MVIZ Sites following the posting of changes to these Terms will
mean that you accept those changes.
Use of MVIZ Sites constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the
Terms; if a user does not accept MVIZ's Terms, he or she is not
granted rights to use MVIZ Sites as defined herein, and should refrain
from accessing MVIZ Sites.
To update these Terms, MVIZ will post both the changed version and its
effective date at http://mindviz.com/terms.php.
MVIZ reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any or all MVIZ Sites (or any
part thereof). MVIZ shall not be liable to any user or other third
party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance except
as expressly provided herein.
2.
NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE
By using MVIZ Sites, you warrant to MVIZ that you will not use MVIZ
Sites, or any of the content obtained from MVIZ Sites, for any purpose
that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. If you violate any of
these Terms, your permission to use the MVIZ Sites automatically
terminates.
3.
REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
When requested, each MVIZ Site user must: (1) personally provide true,
accurate, current and complete information on the MVIZ Site's
registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (2)
maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary to
keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
If, after
investigation, MVIZ has reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's
information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, MVIZ may
suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all
current or future use of the MVIZ Sites (or any portion thereof) by
that user other than as expressly provided herein.
Each user will receive passwords and account designations upon
completing certain MVIZ Site registration processes and is wholly
responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly
liable for all activities occurring thereunder.
MVIZ cannot and will
not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to
comply with this Section 4, including any loss or damage arising from
any user's failure to: (1) immediately notify MVIZ of any unauthorized
use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security;
and (2) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end
of each session.
MVIZ handles user Registration Data in accordance with the MVIZ
Sites' Privacy
Policy.
4.
CONTENT
All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs,
graphics, video, messages, or any other materials whatsoever
(collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted or privately
transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such
Content originated.
This means that the user, and not MVIZ, is
entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts,
emails or otherwise transmits via the MVIZ Sites.
No user shall
transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities
on MVIZ Sites that, in the judgment of MVIZ, is likely to be
prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws
governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the
transmission of obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual
property.
MVIZ reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it
becomes aware and reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose. In
addition, MVIZ shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its
sole discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably
considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal.
MVIZ, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also
disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or
governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by MVIZ to
protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MVIZ Sites'
users and the public. MVIZ does not control the Content posted to the
MVIZ Sites and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or
quality of such Content.
Under no circumstances will MVIZ be liable
in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability
for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage
of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted,
emailed or otherwise transmitted via MVIZ Sites.
Each user, by using MVIZ Sites, may be exposed to Content that is
offensive, indecent or objectionable. Each user must evaluate, and
bear all risks associated with the use of any Content, including any
reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
5.
LICENSING AND OTHER TERMS APPLYING TO CONTENT POSTED ON THE MVIZ SITES:
MVIZ does not claim any ownership rights in the Content that you post to the MVIZ Services.
After posting your Content to the MVIZ Services, you continue to retain all ownership rights
in such Content, and you continue to have the right to use your Content in any way you choose.
By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the MVIZ Services, you hereby
grant to MVIZ a limited license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce,
and distribute such Content solely on and through the MVIZ Services.
Without this license, MVIZ would be unable to provide the MVIZ Services. For example, without
the right to modify Member Content, MVIZ would not be able to digitally compress music files
that Members submit or otherwise format Content to satisfy technical requirements, and without
the right to publicly perform Member Content, MVIZ could not allow Users to listen to music
posted by Members. The license you grant to MVIZ is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to
license your Content to anyone else in addition to MVIZ), fully-paid and royalty-free
(meaning that MVIZ is not required to pay you for the use on the MVIZ Services of the Content
that you post), sublicensable (so that MVIZ is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors
such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the MVIZ Services), and worldwide
(because the Internet and the MVIZ Services are global in reach). The license does not grant
MVIZ the right to sell your Content, nor does the license grant MVIZ the right to distribute
your Content outside of the MVIZ Services.
6.
COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL
By posting Content (Text, Photos, Videos, Music, Poetry, Icons, etc..) on MVIZ Sites,
you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise have the right to grant the
license set forth in Section 5, and that your Content does not violate the
privacy rights, publicity rights, copyright rights or other intellectual property
rights of any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties and fees owing to
any person by reason of any Content you post on MVIZ Sites.
7.
NO RESALE OF SERVICE
You agree not to sell, resell, or offer for any commercial purposes,
any portion of the MVIZ Sites, use of the MVIZ Sites, or access to the
MVIZ Sites.
8.
GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE
MVIZ may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the
MVIZ Sites.
While MVIZ will use reasonable efforts to back up site
data and make such data available in the event of loss or deletion,
MVIZ has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to
store any messages and other communications or other Content
maintained or transmitted by any MVIZ Site. MVIZ reserves the right to
mark as "inactive" and archive accounts and/or Content that are
inactive for an extended period of time. MVIZ reserves the right to
change these general practices at any time, in its sole discretion,
with notice to users and the public as described in Section 1 above.
9.
TERMINATION
MVIZ may terminate a user's account in MVIZ's absolute
discretion and for any reason.
MVIZ is especially likely to terminate
for reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following: (1)
violation of these Terms; (2) abuse of site resources or attempt to
gain unauthorized entry to the site or site resources; (3) use of an
MVIZ Site in a manner inconsistent with the Purpose; (4) a user's
request for such termination; or (4) as required by law, regulation,
court or governing agency order.
MVIZ's termination of any user's access to any or all MVIZ Sites may
be effected without notice and, on such termination, MVIZ may
immediately deactivate or delete user's account and/or bar any further
access to such files. MVIZ shall not be liable to any user or other
third party for any termination of that user's access or account
hereunder. In addition, a user's request for termination will
result in deactivation but not necessarily deletion of the account.
MVIZ reserves the right to delete, or not delete, a user's
account at MVIZ's sole discretion, as well as to delete, or not
delete, content at MVIZ's sole discretion.
10.
LINKS
MVIZ, any MVIZ Site or a third party may provide links to other
websites. MVIZ exercises no control whatsoever over such other
websites and web-based resources and is not responsible or liable for
the availability thereof or the Content, advertising, products or
other materials thereon.
MVIZ shall not be responsible or liable,
directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss incurred or suffered by
any user in connection therewith.
Your access and use of linked
websites, including information, material, products and services
therein, is solely at your own risk.
The MVIZ Sites' Privacy Statement is applicable only when you
are on an MVIZ Site. Once you choose to link to another website, you
should read that website's privacy statement before disclosing
any personal information.
11.
INDEMNITY; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
Each user shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless MVIZ, and its
parent corporation and affiliates and their respective officers,
employees and agents, and each of MVIZ's website partners, from any
and all claims, demands, damages, costs, and liabilities including
reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising
out of that user's acts or omissions, including claims arising out of
that user's use of the MVIZ Sites; his or her submission, posting or
transmission of Content or his or her violation of the Terms.
EACH USER'S USE OF THE MVIZ SITES IS AT HIS OR HER SOLE RISK. THE MVIZ

ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY

SETTINGS.
EACH USER WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO HIS
OR HER COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD
OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.
MVIZ EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
SPECIFICALLY, MVIZ MAKES NO WARRANTY
THAT (i) THE MVIZ SITES OR ANY SERVICE THEREON WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, (ii) ANY USER ACCESS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY,
SECURE OR ERROR-FREE, (iii) THE QUALITY OF ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS,
SERVICES, INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIAL OBTAINED BY ANY USER WILL MEET
HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS, AND (iv) ANY ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
CORRECTED.
EXCLUDING ONLY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF MVIZ'S GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, MVIZ SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF MVIZ HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY USER'S
USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY MVIZ SITES OR SERVICES THEREON; THE COST
OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR
ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY
THIRD PARTY ON THE MVIZ SITES; OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE
MVIZ SITES.
IN NO EVENT SHALL MVIZ'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO
ANY USER OR OTHER PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR OTHERWISE
EXCEED $1,000.00.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED TO
CREATE AN AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP, JOINT VENTURE, EMPLOYEE-EMPLOYER OR
FRANCHISOR-FRANCHISEE RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND BETWEEN MVIZ AND ANY
USER OR OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY NOR DO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE EXTEND
RIGHTS TO ANY THIRD PARTY.
AS NOTED ABOVE, MVIZ DOES NOT AND CANNOT
CONTROL THE ACTIONS OF MVIZ SITE USERS, VISITORS OR LINKED THIRD
PARTIES.
WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REPORT ANY MALFEASANCE THAT COMES TO
OUR ATTENTION TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES.
WE DO NOT GUARANTEE
CONTINUOUS UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE ACCESS TO MVIZ SITES. OPERATION OF
MVIZ SITES MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE FROM NUMEROUS FACTORS
OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL.
FURTHER, SCHEDULED AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE AS
WELL AS REQUIRED AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE WORK MAY TEMPORARILY

COPYRIGHTS
MVIZ respects the intellectual property rights of others, and requires
that the people who use the MVIZ Sites do the same.
It is our policy
to respond promptly to claims of intellectual property misuse.
If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on
this site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may
notify us by providing our copyright agent with the following
information in writing:
(1)
the electronic or physical signature of the owner of the
copyright or the person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;
(2)
identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been
infringed;
(3)
identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
and information reasonably sufficient to permit MVIZ to locate the
material, including the full URL.
(4)
your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
(5)
a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the
disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
the law;
(6)
a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright
owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
If MVIZ receives such a claim, MVIZ reserves the right to refuse or
delete Content as described under Section 5 hereto, or to terminate a
user's account in accordance with Section 9.
Our designated agent to receive notification of claimed infringement
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act OF 1998
("DMCA") is:
DMCA Claims, MindViz
P.O. Box 551
Hockessin, DE 19711
or Contact Us Here
After receiving a claim of infringement, MVIZ will process and
investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate
actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property
laws. Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying
with the DMCA, MVIZ will act expeditiously to remove or disable access
to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject
of infringing activity, and will act expeditiously to remove or
disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that
is claimed to be infringing.
MVIZ will take reasonable steps to
expeditiously notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled
access to such material.
Upon receipt of a proper counter notification under the DMCA, MVIZ
will promptly provide the person who provided the initial notification
of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification and
inform that person that it will replace the removed material or cease
disabling access to it in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days.
Additionally, MVIZ will replace the removed material and cease
disabling access to it ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days
following receipt of the counter notice, unless MVIZ's
designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted
the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking
a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing
activity relating to the material on the MVIZ system or network.
You may provide us with a counter notification by providing our
copyright agent the following information in writing:
(1)
your physical or electronic signature;
(2)
identification of the material that has been removed or to
which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material
appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled, including
the full URL;
(3)
a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith
belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
disabled;
(4)
your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that
you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the
judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address
is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which
MVIZ may be found and that you will accept service of process from the
person who provided the initial notification of infringement.
14.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and MVIZ
and govern each user's use of MVIZ Sites, superseding any prior
agreements. Each user may be subject to additional terms and
conditions that may apply when that user uses affiliate services,
third party content or third party software.
The Terms and the
relationship between each user and MVIZ shall be governed by the laws
of the State of Maryland without regard to its conflict of law
provisions and each party shall submit to the personal and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Elkton,
Maryland.
If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
the Terms remain in full force and effect.
15.
VIOLATIONS
Please report any violations of the Terms (except for claims of
intellectual property infringement) to the MVIZ Site Director here.
