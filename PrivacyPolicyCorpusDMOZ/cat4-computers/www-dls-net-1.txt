Open Internet Policy
DLS supports the belief that the Internet is an open platform that enables consumer choice, freedom of expression, end-user control, competition, and the freedom to innovate without permission. In the interests of preserving the foregoing, the following information regarding DLS’ broadband Internet services (“DLS Services”) and practices is provided for the convenience of our current and prospective customers. Specifically, this policy and the information provided enable our end users to make informed choices regarding the use of such services and to understand the capabilities of broadband services.This information is also provided for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.DLS’ services are currently governed by its Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). DLS’ AUP is available on its website located at: here. This Open Internet Policy is used in conjunction with DLS’ AUP.Network PracticesCongestion Management: It is important to note that DLS manages its network to ensure that all of its customers have a great online experience. The Internet is changing all of our lives and we want our customers to enjoy all that it has to offer. For more than a decade, DLS has been at the forefront of bringing the Internet into our customers’ homes and has invested in a high-capacity advanced network that is fast, safe, reliable and affordable.Like any other Internet service provider, we manage our network for many reasons including growing, upgrading and optimizing the network; removing spam, viruses and malicious content; and managing network traffic congestion when it occurs. While congestion is not the normal state of any network, when it happens, it can be frustrating.Because DLS values its customers’ freedom to use the Internet and DLS’ services, so long as an end user complies with the terms and conditions of DLS’ AUP, DLS will not actively manage any particular types of traffic. All traffic that is transmitted using DLS’ Service is treated equally and without prejudice.Examples of types of traffic that violate the DLS AUP include but are not limited to data that:Is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another’s privacy, tortious, indecent, pornographic or inaccurateVictimizes, harasses, degrades, or intimidates an individual or group of individuals on the basis of religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, disability or any other reasonIs posted in violation of a newsgroup charterContains viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another’s computerHas a negative effect on DLS or its network (including, without limitation, overloading servers on the DLS Network; causing portions of the DLS Network to be blocked by other network providers; generating unresolved third party complaints or complaints which, in the discretion of DLS, impose an unreasonable administrative burden on the company; etc.).Constitutes unsolicited duplicative e-mail (commercial or otherwise)The occurrence of any of the above acts would cause DLS to intervene and manage the end user’s traffic. The above list is not exhaustive and an end user should refer to the DLS AUP for a full list and description of all traffic and activities that are not permitted.Application-Specific Behavior: There are certain times in which a provider must block or rate-control specific protocols or protocol parts, modify protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standard, or otherwise inhibit or favor certain applications or classes of applications. As with our approach towards congestion management, so long as an end user complies with the terms and conditions of our AUP, DLS will not block or rate-control any protocols or otherwise limit such applications in any way.Device Attachment Rules: Certain providers find it necessary to either place restrictions on or create approval procedures for the types of devices that may connect to its network. DLS takes a neutral stance on device attachment to our network and does not place any restrictions so long as our AUP is not violated.Security: DLS goes to great lengths to ensure end-user security and the security of its network. Those practices are set forth in detail in DLS’ AUP.Performance CharacteristicsDLS offers a range of download speeds to subscribers varying from 256kbps to 6mbps (megabits per second) for residential and 1.5mbps to 1gbps for commercial. The network is designed to support these speeds to help ensure that every subscriber receives the speeds to which they have subscribed. DLS, however, cannot guarantee speeds at all times, as there are many factors and conditions beyond DLS’ control that can affect Internet performance. Some of these external factors and conditions are:Performance of subscriber computer and/or routerType of connection to DLS Customer Premise Equipment (i.e. WIFI)Congestion of web sites and services on the InternetWeb site or service limiting speeds on the InternetInternet performance outside of the DLS NetworkResidential and Commercial TermsPricing: DLS strongly believes in a customer’s easy access to service pricing. Service pricing can be found at the DLS Website.Privacy Policies: Any and all of DLS’ privacy policies as it relates to an end user’s use of DLS’ services are fully explained in its AUP.Redress Options: DLS takes great pride in providing its customers with the best broadband Internet experience possible. However, there are times when a dispute may arise. To ensure all of our customers’ complaints and questions are promptly received, processed and responded to, DLS has set forth dispute resolution provisions in both its AUP and service agreements and orders.
