Terms of Use
Please Read Carefully Before Using This Website: The following terms of service ("Terms of Use") govern your use of the /n software Website (the "Site") and any web-based hosted services downloaded or accessed through the Site (collectively referred to herein as "Service(s)"), all of which are operated by /n software, Inc. ("/n software" or "we"). By using the Site and/or the Service, you irrevocably agree that such use is subject to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the Site or the Service. If you are entering into these Terms of Use on behalf of an entity, you are binding such entity to these Terms of Use, you represent that you have the actual authority to bind such entity to these Terms of Use, and references to “you” mean such entity.
/n software expressly reserves the right to modify the Terms of Use at any time in its sole discretion by including such alteration and/or modification in these Terms of Use, along with a notice of the effective date of such modified Terms of Use. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an e-mail to the billing contact you designate in your User Account (as defined below), through your User Account or in the Service itself). To the extent you have purchased a subscription to the Service, the modified terms will be effective as to such subscription Service upon your next subscription renewal. In this case, if you object to the updated terms, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew, including canceling any terms set to auto-renew. In all other cases, any continued use by you of the Site or the Service after the posting of such modified Terms of Use shall be deemed to indicate your irrevocable agreement to such modified Terms of Use. Accordingly, if at any time you do not agree to be subject to any modified Terms of Use, you may no longer use the Site or Service.
User Account Registration; Passwords
Account Registration and Use License: In order to access and use all of the features of the Service, you are required to open an account (“User Account”) by registering with /n software. When you register for your User Account you must provide true, accurate, current and complete information (“Account Information”), and you agree to update the Account Information in order to ensure that it is current. Upon proper registration and opening of a User Account, and subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, /n software hereby grants to you the personal, non-transferable right and license to use the Service, solely for your own internal business purposes, until such time as either you or /n software elect to terminate such right in accordance with these Terms of Use.
Eligibility: As an express condition of being permitted to open a User Account, you represent and warrant that you (i) have the legal capacity (including, without limitation, being of sufficient age) to enter into contracts under the law of the jurisdiction in which you reside, (ii) are not on a list of persons barred you from receiving services under U.S. laws (including, without limitation, the Denied Persons List and the Entity List issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security) or other applicable jurisdiction and (iii) are not a resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.
Passwords: Upon registration on the Site, you will provide /n software with a password to access your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for all of your activities and those of any third party that occur through your account, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify /n software of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of your User Account. You agree that /n software will not under any circumstances be liable for any cost, loss, damages, or expenses arising out of a failure by you to maintain the security of your password.

Except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Use, any use of the /n software Content may violate copyright and/or other applicable laws.
Third Party Content: In addition to /n software Content, the Site and/or the Service may contain information and materials provided to /n software by third parties (collectively, “Third Party Content”). Third Party Content is the copyrighted work of its owner, who expressly retains all right title and interest in and to the Third Party Content, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein and thereto. In addition to being subject to these Terms of Use, Third Party Content may also be subject to different and/or additional terms of use and/or privacy policies of such third parties. Please contact the appropriate third party for further information regarding any such different and/or additional terms of use applicable to Third Party Content.
Limited Site Content License: /n software grants you the limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to use the /n software Content and Third Party Content (collectively, “Site Content”) by displaying the Site Content on your computer, and downloading and printing pages from the Site containing Site Content, under the condition that (i) such activity is solely for your personal, education or other non-commercial use, (ii) you do not modify or prepare derivative works from the Site Content, (iii) you do not obscure, alter or remove any notice of copyright set forth on any Site pages or Site Content, (iv) you do not otherwise reproduce, re-distribute or publicly display any of the Site Content and (v) you do not copy any Site Content to any other media or storage format.
Trademarks: All trademarks, service marks and logos included on the Site (“Marks”) are the property of /n software or third parties, and you may not use such Marks without the express, prior written consent of /n software or the applicable third party
Monitoring of Site Content and use of Service: /n software reserves the right, but does not undertake the obligation, to monitor use of the Site and/or the Service, and to investigate and take appropriate legal action against any party that uses the Site in violation of these Terms of Use or applicable law. /n software reserves the right to accept, reject or modify any Site Content or User Content, but assumes no liability based on its acceptance, rejection, modification or failure to modify any Site Content or User Content.
Copyright Infringement: As a condition of your right to use the Site and the Service, you agree to respect the intellectual property rights of others. Accordingly, you agree not to upload or post to the Site or the Service any copyrighted materials, trademarks or other proprietary information belonging to any third party without the prior written consent of the applicable third party. You acknowledge that /n software will terminate your access to the Site and/or the Service if you repeatedly infringe the copyright of third parties. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been illegally uploaded or posted on the Site or the Service, you may send a written notice to /n software at legal@nsoftware.com, and /n software will respond pursuant to its Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) procedure. /n software's DMCA procedure is in accordance with that suggested by DMCA, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office web site http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf. /n software reserves all rights to seek damages and fees associated with infringement and/or fraud.
Your Use of the Site and Service
Account and Use of Service: You may use your User Account for the Service only in accordance with these Terms of Use and only for lawful purposes. You are responsible for your own communications, including the upload, transmission and posting of information, and are responsible for the consequences of their posting on or through the Service.
Fees: Some features of the Service may only be accessed and used upon the payment of applicable fees (“Fees”). Fees may vary depending on usage in accordance with our current pricing policy. If you do not initially register for a version of the Service that requires the payment of a fee, you will nonetheless be permitted to use all of the features of the Service for a period determined by /n software or if not designated by /n software otherwise, fourteen (14) days (“Free Trial Period”). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, ANY SERVICE PROVIDED DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD IS PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDEMNITIES. Upon the expiration of the Free Trial Period, you will only be able to access and use those features of the Service the use of which does not require the payment of a Fee, unless you subsequently upgrade to a paid version of the Service. All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.
Cancellation and Termination by You: You are solely responsible for properly canceling your User Account. You can cancel your User Account at any time by contacting /n software via e-mail or phone. If you cancel your User Account before the end of your current paid up term, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. Please note that we do not provide refunds for unused time in the last billing cycle.
Termination and Suspension by /n software: /n software may terminate your User Account and/or these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason upon notice to you. We may also suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your User Account without cause, we will refund a prorated portion of any prepayment. We will not refund or reimburse you if we terminate your User Account for cause, including (without limitation) for a violation of these Terms of Use.
Effect of Termination: Once your User Account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Account and any or all User Content associated with it. If you do not log in to your User Account for 12 or more months, we may treat your User Account as “inactive” and permanently delete the User Account and all the data associated with it. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms of Use. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive, including without limitation, accrued rights to payment, use restrictions and indemnity obligations, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
Prohibited Conduct: You agree not to use the Site or the Service for: (i) posting any (1) information which is incomplete, false, inaccurate or not your own, (2) trade secrets or material that is copyrighted or otherwise owned by a third party unless you have a valid license from the owner which permits you to post it, (3) material that infringes on any other intellectual property, privacy or publicity right of another, (4) advertisement, promotional materials or solicitation related to any product or service that is competitive with /n software products or services or (5) software or programs which contain any harmful code, including, but not limited to, viruses, worms, time bombs or Trojan horses; (ii) impersonating another person; (iii) engaging in or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any city, state, national or international law or regulation, or which fails to comply with accepted Internet protocol; or (iv) transmitting or transferring (by any means) information or software derived from the Site or the Service to foreign countries or certain foreign nations in violation of US export control laws.
