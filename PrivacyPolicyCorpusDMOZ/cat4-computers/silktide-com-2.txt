Understanding policies
Policies are custom rules and checks unique to you. Policies help you maintain a global set of rules across your websites. They can cover writing, multimedia, brand, legal compliance, and more.
Global policy library
Off-the-shelf policies covering a wide range of common errors. These may include unlinked email addresses, missing page descriptions, or long paragraphs.
Integrating our policies into the platform has helped us to maintain a high standard of writing and consistency across teams.

Page violation report
It’s useful to see which policies you are checking for. It’s also critical that you can see a list of violations by page. Silktide gives you this information in one location.
