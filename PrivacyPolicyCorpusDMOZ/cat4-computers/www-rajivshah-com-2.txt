FTC Bars Bogus Anti-Spyware Claims
FTC:
An operation that offered consumers free spyware detection scans that “detected” spyware even if there was not any, to market anti-spyware software that does not work has been barred from making deceptive claims by a U. S. District court at the request of the FTC. The FTC will seek a permanent halt to the marketing scam and redress for consumers.
