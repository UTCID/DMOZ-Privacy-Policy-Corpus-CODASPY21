Online Privacy Resources and Tools
Online privacy is one of the hottest Internet topics. It is a major concern for Internet users. Even if you are sure your privacy is being protected you should still be very careful about revealing your private information online.
Privacy concerns apply to everything from your search history to your social network profiles. Apps on smartphones and tablets also raise privacy concerns when they use your camera and microphone. You want to control your own personal information and keep it out of the hands of criminals and corporations. If your data is shared (such as by a major search engine) you want the data to be anonymized. Users also want to make sure companies are not storing their data permanently and not sharing it with other companies without their knowledge.
