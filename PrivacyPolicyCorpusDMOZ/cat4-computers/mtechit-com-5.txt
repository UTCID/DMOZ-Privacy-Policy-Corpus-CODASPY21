Ticket Integration
Ticket Integration
Automatically create, update and close tickets in response to many events.
Hitachi ID Bravura Pass can be interfaced to your help desk system, so that all call records
(problem tickets) are automatically generated or updated.
The interface provides two major benefits:
Bravura Pass can report it's actions to the help desk system, providing a
uniform method of logging for different types of incidents, including
password problems.
Support staff need not enter redundant information about calls.
Data entered into Bravura Pass is automatically propagated to the help
desk program.
Alternately, data entered into the help desk system
can be automatically passed to Bravura Pass.
A standard facility is used to interface Bravura Pass to any help desk system,
from any vendor.
This facility can:
Create new call records.
Update and optionally close existing call records.
Exchange data with the help desk system when any of a
wide range of events takes place on the Bravura Pass server.
Events that
may trigger interaction between Bravura Pass and a help desk system
include user and administrator authentication attempts, password
verification or reset, security violations, successful or failed
operations, etc.
Execute complex business logic.
You can configure the software to execute different actions
based on different events, the state of existing call records,
the time of day, etc.
Send e-mail to support staff, security officers or users.
Execute programs on the Bravura Pass server.
Bravura Pass comes with several standard interface programs for popular
help desk call management systems:
Axios Assyst.
Atlassian JIRA.
BMC/Remedy ARS (4, 5, 6, 7).
BMC/RemedyForce.
BMC Service Desk Express (7.0, 7.5, 9.x).
