PRIVACY
We collect and use information about you and your use of the Services. Please review our [Privacy Policy – HYPERLINK] for more information. Residents of California should read our [California Privacy Statement – HYPERLINK] which supplements our Privacy Policy to describe our processing of their personal information.
COMMUNICATIONS
We will not send you our newsletter or advertising emails unless you affirmatively select the “opt-in” option on our Site. If you “opt-in” but later change your mind, you may unsubscribe from these emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in any email or by contacting us via email at marketing@densoautoparts.com with the word “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line.
CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE
These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without regard to its conflict of law rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply hereto.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of, is related to, or is connected in any way to this Agreement, (“Dispute”), then you agree the Dispute shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in Long Beach, California, and you agree that all disputes will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. You hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of California. Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment
in any court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties. As permitted by applicable law, you agree that any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, related to or connected in any way with your use of the Services must be filed by you within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned. Any and all claims, judgments, and awards will be limited to actual third-party, out-of-pocket costs incurred (if any), but in no event will attorneys’ fees be awarded or recoverable.
ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NO ARBITRATOR MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.
YOU ARE THUS GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR HEARING, BUT THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN THE RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. ARBITRATOR DECISIONS ARE AS ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT ORDER AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
SEVERABILITY
In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of this Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, we shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force. Headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not be used in its construction and/or interpretation.
NON-WAIVER
We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or applicable law will not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.
ASSIGNMENT
You may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntary, by operation of contract, law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
