Crystalfontz America owns and operates the www.crystalfontz.com website. By accessing, visiting, browsing, using or interacting or attempting to interact with any part of the website or any software, program or services on the website you agree on your behalf personally, and on behalf of any entity for which you are an agent or you appear to represent, (collectively and individually "you," "your," "user" or "customer") to each of the Crystalfontz America policies.

Warranty
Repair or Replacement for Defective Products
Products under warranty may be returned for repair or replacement. For more information on the warranty, please see our Warranty Policy on our website.
Standard vs. Special Orders
Crystalfontz America's return policy is different for "Standard" orders and "Special" orders.
Standard Orders are orders for current products on Crystalfontz America's website.
Special Orders are orders for products that are not currently on Crystalfontz America's website or are customized, non-standard products (also known as a Defined Part or DP).
Standard Orders: Crystalfontz America will only consider return requests for standard orders when the request is made within thirty (30) days of delivery. Please note that there is a restocking fee of up to 30% of the purchase price and shipping charges are nonrefundable. A customer can avoid a restocking fee by reviewing their order confirmation to ensure the correct products have been ordered.
Special Orders: Defective products can be returned for repair or replacement.
Non-Returnable and Non-Refundable Products
Discounted products are non-returnable and non-refundable (NR/NR). Discounted products are products that are end-of-life and have limited availability. Discounted products are not recommended for new designs as there may not be a direct replacement offered by Crystalfontz America. The customer understands and agrees that "NR/NR" products cannot be returned or refunded.
For more information on how to "Return a Product" click here.
Defined Parts
A Defined Part (DP) is a part that has been configured with additional and/or different features from our standard part that requires work to be performed on the part in order to meet the specific requirements from the customer. The changes to the part creates what is referred to as a defined part and must have a new part number assigned to it for identification purposes.
Defined Part Agreement
By approving the configuration of a defined part with Crystalfontz America, the customer is acknowledging that they have reviewed the part configuration and pricing, and that they agree to all aspects of the newly defined part.
Once a DP has been approved by the customer, it can never be changed or revised.
Customer Samples
Crystalfontz America recommends that the customer purchase physical samples of the DP for full functional review and approval prior to placing additional Purchase Orders for the purchase of the DP. However, if the customer prefers, the customer can waive the review of the physical samples. The customer must indicate that they waived review and are approving the part configuration without samples by writing in the RT ticket for the DP.
Additionally, waiving of a physical sample review does not absolve the customer of ownership of any issues that come up with the receipt of future orders of the DP that such a review would have captured and resolved prior.
If there is any level of change to any of the features specifically called out in the agreed upon and approved DP configuration, a new DP will need to be defined.
Upon Receipt of Samples
Customer should either:
State in writing in the DP support ticket, their approval of the DP Configuration and Pricing based on their review of the sample parts.
OR
State in writing in the DP support ticket the issues they encountered with the sample parts. At this time, the process will begin again with the Crystalfontz America engineer working with the customer to redefine the part configuration and get approval on the new sample.
Important: For DP approval and lifetime management of the DP, Crystalfontz America will require for the customer to identify the one individual who will represent the entire customer organization in giving approval of the DP. The identified individual authorized to give customer approval shall do so representing their organization and any subsequent Contract Manufacturers that the customer authorizes to purchase this DP.
Warranty Coverage
Crystalfontz America's limited warranty covers:
All products are free of functional defects for a period of one-year from the date of shipment.
All products are free of visual defects and missing parts for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of shipment.
