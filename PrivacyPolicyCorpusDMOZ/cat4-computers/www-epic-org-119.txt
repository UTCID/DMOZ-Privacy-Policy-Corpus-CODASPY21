Washington, D.C.
In the Matter of
CAN-SPAM Act Rulemaking (Do Not E-Mail)
FTC Project No. R411008
COMMENTS OF
The Electronic Privacy Information Center
March 31, 2004
Pursuant to the FTC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking[1] dated March 11, 2004,
regarding the CAN-SPAM Act and the "National Do Not E-mail" Registry,
the Electronic Privacy Information Center submits the following comments,
recommending that the Do Not Email Registry must be understood to be one part
of a multi-tiered, international approach to protecting consumers from spam,
and that the Do Not Email registry should protect individual privacy interests
on the Internet by using domain-level listings to protect the privacy of individual
email addresses.
The Electronic Privacy Information Center ("EPIC") has a long-standing
interest and participation on the complex policy issue of reducing spam. In
testimony last year to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg discussed the need for a "multi-tiered
approach" combining aggressive enforcement, technical solutions (such
as filtering and identification of spam), and cooperation at the state and
international level. [2] As part of the Privacy Coalition, EPIC joined a group
of consumer, civil liberties, computer science, and privacy organizations
in recommending a basic policy framework for addressing spam.[3] This policy
framework is defined by six principles:
A clear definition of spam as unsolicited, bulk, commercial email
Establish Opt-in
Ensure private rights of action
Enable technical solutions
Support international cooperation
Oppose preemption of state efforts to combat spam
Further, EPIC has participated in international discussions on spam at the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development[4] ("OECD"),
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation[5] ("APEC"), and the Trans-Atlantic
Consumer Dialogue ("TACD"), a forum of 65 consumer groups from the
U.S. and the European Union.
SPAM REQUIRES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
International cooperation is vital to address the global nature of spam. As
TACD recognizes, "concerns about spam are shared by consumers around
the world."[6] Just as no one solution exists to spam, no one country
can fight the spam problem alone. The Privacy Coalition has emphasized the
importance of international cooperation,[7] and both the OECD and TACD emphasize
that effective reductions in spam and cross-border enforcement against spammers
require that the United States and other countries work together to harmonize
legislative approaches[8]. The Do Not Email registry has the potential to
be an important part of an international framework and enforcement mechanism
against spam. As one piece of the anti-spam puzzle, the effectiveness of the
Do Not Email registry on reducing spam depends on cooperation with other spam
reduction policies. Specifically, TACD has recommended that the Do Not Email
list be created in a manner to provide strong protections for individual users.[9]
A domain level Do Not Email registry achieves theses important goals of international
cooperation and privacy protection.
DOMAIN LEVEL DISCLOSURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE "DO NOT EMAIL"
REGISTRY TO WORK WITH OTHER SPAM REDUCTION EFFORTS
A key element where the Do Not Email registry can cooperate with other spam-fighting
policies as part of a multi-tiered, international approach is to focus registry
listings at the domain level rather than individual email addresses.
The Do Not Email registry must protect individual privacy by collecting and
disclosing only domain names of users that do not wish to receive emails.
A Do Not Email registry that collects and discloses individual email addresses
frustrates several other spam reduction policies, including consumer approaches
promulgated by the FTC itself.[10] The FTC has long recommended that consumers
on the Internet protect their email addresses from disclosure to others as
a way to reduce spam and prevent potential for fraud and identity theft.[11]
This guidance to consumers is designed to protect individual privacy and prevent
abuse of email addresses from risks of fraud and identity theft (e.g., "phishing").[12]
An email address-based Do Not Email registry would frustrate and hamper individual
privacy interests and the FTC's anti-spam recommendations of non-disclosure
of private email addresses.[13] Disclosing individual email addresses to the
Do Not Email list would allow spammers to find valid individual email addresses:
the FTC has found evidence of email addresses harvesting for spam from email
service directories.[14] Further, this list would be subject to abuse from
spammers who disregard the CAN SPAM Act or who are beyond the reach of U.S.
enforcement; spammers could simply move to countries with little or no anti-spam
policy while harvesting email addresses from an email address-based Do Not
Email registry. Consumers wishing to reduce spam by using the Do Not Email
list should not have to sacrifice their individual privacy by disclosing their
individual email addresses in a global list available to spammers.
As a further example of how an email address-based Do Not Email registry could
frustrate other anti-spam policy, a Do Not Email registry based on individual
addresses unfairly places additional burden on users that change email addresses
frequently to avoid spam. The FTC has advised consumers to set up such "disposable"
addresses as one way to avoid spam.[15] With an email address-based Do Not
Email registry, a consumer following the FTC advice would be burdened by having
to reregister the new email address in the registry every time an email address
change was made. By unfairly placing an additional burden on consumers, the
individual email address Do Not Email registry would frustrate other anti-spam
polices.
A DOMAIN LEVEL "DO NOT EMAIL" REGISTRY AS AN ENFORCEMENT
TOOL TO REDUCE SPAM
The domain level Do Not Email registry has the potential for being a strong
enforcement mechanism for the CAN-SPAM Act by eliminating some of the technical,
security, and practical enforceability issues arising under an email address-based
Do Not Email registry. Specifically, enforcement of violations of the CAN
SPAM Act by ISPs will be simpler under a domain-based Do Not Email registry.
By placing a domain on the Do Not Email registry, the ISP can begin to easily
establish patterns or practices of violations of § 5(a) of the CAN SPAM
Act. By virtue of placing its domain on the Do Not Email registry, an ISP
may create the reasonable presumption that all users on its network do not
wish to receive spam, and that further spam to that domain is a transmission
of spam after objection, in violation of § 5(a) (4) of the CAN SPAM Act.[16]
Legitimate businesses are free to rebut this by proving affirmative consent
or a transactional or business relationship with an individual user on a domain,
as provided by the CAN SPAM Act.
By listing domain names instead of individual email addresses, the Do Not
Email registry would become an effective tool for Internet Service Providers
("ISPs") to limit spam, in addition to use of the Do Not Email registry
by individual Internet users. ISPs are forced to pay the bandwidth costs of
delivering spam mail; ISPs also bear the costs of spam filtering to protect
their users. A domain-based Do Not Email registry would allow ISPs to protect
their networks against unwanted email, fraud, and identity theft risks. Acknowledging
the interests of ISPs in reducing spam, the CAN SPAM Act allows ISPs to pursue
enforcement actions against spammers. Listing only domains in the Do Not Email
registry, and not individual emails, is consistent with the legislative intent
to allow ISPs to protect themselves against abusive spam traffic.
Further, since Congress did not include a private right of action against
spammers in the CAN SPAM Act, the Do Not Email registry under the legislation
should not include private, individual email addresses. As CAN SPAM may be
enforced by ISPs managing at the domain level, but not by individual consumers,
then there is no reason to force individuals to disclose individual email
addresses since there is no private right to enforce violations of that specific
email addresses.
CONCLUSION
The Do Not Email Registry has the potential to be an important part of a global
strategy to reduce the spam problem. There is no silver bullet that will solve
the complex problem of spam[17]; many groups, including EPIC, the Privacy
Coalition, OECD, and TACD have recognized that the most effective strategy
to reducing spam is a multi-tiered framework of policy, technical, and legislative
tools. A Do Not Email Registry could form part of this strategy and improve
enforcement powers of ISPs. However, it should be implemented with domain-level
information rather than individuals' e-mail addresses.
