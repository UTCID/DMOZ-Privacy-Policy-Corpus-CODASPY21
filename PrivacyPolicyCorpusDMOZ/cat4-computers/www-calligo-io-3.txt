Data Protection Officer as a Service (DPOaaS)
Sidestep the difficulty of appointing internally, and the cost of hiring, and ensure your continuous compliance and total data safety
Speak to a data privacy consultant
Why outsource your Data Protection Officer requirement?
Our Outsourced Data Protection Officer (DPO as a service) is the best way to stay on top of data privacy regulations without the cost and time investment of a full-time hire. Calligo is the only IT managed services provider to put privacy first, which makes us uniquely qualified to provide businesses with regulatory services that don't hinder their operations.
No conflict of interest
Businesses often appoint the DPO internally, usually to their heads of legal, technology or security, which is a clear conflict of interest and often contrary to the regulations.
Faster to appoint
There are 10x as many DPO vacancies as there are qualified individuals. If you intend to recruit a DPO, finding and affording the right one for you is a long process.
More cost-effective
By outsourcing the DPO role, you gain access to a wider set of skills, including technical, legal and infosecurity, all at a lower cost than recruiting full-time.
Why choose a Data Protection Officer service?
Only certain regulations require or recommend that a Data Protection Officer or Data Privacy Officer is necessary.Some of those our team encounters the most:
If you are within the scope of PIPEDA, you are required to appoint a DPO, conventionally referred to as a “Privacy Officer”, responsible for continuous observance of PIPEDA
If you are within the scope of HIPAA, you require a designated person with responsibility for the development and implementation of policies
If you are under the scope of GDPR and are:
A public sector authority, or
Processing large volumes of data on a regular basis, or
Processing special categories of data or personal data related to criminal convictions and offences
However, whether you are under the scope of such regulations or not, it is well-recognized best practice for any organization that relies upon personal data to appoint a central point of data privacy oversight.
