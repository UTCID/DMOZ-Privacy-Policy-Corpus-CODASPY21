PROHIBITED DOMAIN NAMES. You will not enroll a domain name for parking with Afternic if You do not have the right to do so or if such enrollment would violate any laws or intellectual property rights of another, including without limitation trademark or service mark rights (each a "Prohibited Domain Name"). Afternic retains the right to unilaterally and without notice cancel the enrollment of any such Prohibited Domain Name and, in Afternic's sole discretion, seek legal recourse against You and any other parties for such enrollment.

It is Your sole responsibility to withhold any and all local, state, federal, and foreign taxes on payments that You receive pursuant to the Parking Terms of Service, and You agree to indemnify Afternic and any third-party beneficiary to the Parking Terms of Service for any claim or assessment of taxes and any costs or damages relating thereto. Afternic is entitled to offset any refunds You are obligated to provide under the Parking Terms of Service against any payments that would otherwise be due to You. Fraudulent, questionable, or low-quality traffic will not be counted when determining Your payments due under the Parking Terms of Service. This determination is and will be made by Afternic in its sole discretion.
PROHIBITED ACTS. You will not authorize or engage in, or engage or enable a third party, on Your behalf, to do any of the following: (1) queries or clicks on results on any Parked Domain Name(s) generated by misleading or incentivized means, including, but not limited to: queries or clicks required in order to obtain some benefit or to perform another function, such as leaving a webpage or closing a window; (2) You, Your employees, contractors or agents clicking on results on any Parked Domain Name(s) except in the course of normal individual use; (3) offering a user any pecuniary or other in kind inducement to search or click on results on any Parked Domain Name(s); (4) use of any Parked Domain Name(s) for the delivery of unsolicited commercial e-mail messages or any other illegal or dubious purpose or activity; or (5) any kind of traffic manipulation, including but not limited to inflation, deflation, or other adjustment of the traffic or bidded clicks received by any Parked Domain Name(s).

FAST TRANSFER TERMS OF SERVICE FOR AFTERNIC SELLERS
By offering one or more domain names that seller owns for sale via Fast Transfer (each, a "Listed Domain"), seller signifies its agreement to the applicable Fast Transfer Terms of Service in addition to our Membership Agreement, available at: http://www.afternic.com/legal#membership_agreement, and incorporated herein by reference.
Please review these terms carefully. Some Fast Transfers are e-commerce only, without sales assistance or guidance, and these terms contain important rights and responsibilities for Afternic sellers who use Fast Transfer. To the extent that these terms of service conflict with our Membership Agreement, the conflicting terms here shall supersede the Membership Agreement but only with respect to Fast Transfers and only to the extent of such conflict.
A. Prerequisites to Use Fast Transfer Process
Seller must be an Afternic member. The terms of the Afternic Membership Agreement apply to all Fast Transfer transactions. To become a member, and participate in Fast Transfer, seller must join Afternic. The new user registration page is available at: http://www.afternic.com/domain-account.
Seller must enroll in the Afternic DLS Premium Promotion service. For information on enrolling, go to the DLS Premium Promotion page. Specific terms related to Fast Transfer may be found at that internet address. Seller must enroll and accept the terms before seller can sell a Listed Domain via Fast Transfer.
Seller must register each Listed Domain with one of our Fast Transfer partners or, seller may transfer the Listed Domain to one of our Fast Transfer partners now. It must be registered with an Fast Transfer partner before seller is permitted to list a domain under the Fast Transfer process. A list of Fast Transfer partners is available at: DLS Premium Promotion page.
Seller must provide Afternic a Buy Now Price. Fast Transfer is primarily an e-commerce transaction, and may not involve the assistance of a salesperson. Seller must provide Afternic pricing information in advance. If seller does not supply a Buy Now Price and a Minimum Offer, the posting will either fail, or seller will experience a delay in having a Listed Domain posted for sale. Seller's name may be listed only after seller has provided Afternic a Buy Now Price and Afternic has taken reasonable steps to ensure the validity of the Listed Name.
Seller must provide Afternic prompt notice. Until seller notifies Afternic that a seller has sold the Listed Name(s) outside the scope of the Fast Transfer partners and/or process, Afternic and its Fast Transfer partners shall retain the right to sell the seller's Listed Name(s) until seller confirms that Afternic is in receipt of seller's notification.
B. Additional Fast Transfer Terms and Conditions for Sellers
Seller acknowledges and agrees that Afternic has the right to verify any proposed Listed Domain sale transaction or the underlying registration of such Listed Domain. Verification may delay the posting of a Listed Domain. Afternic, as a regular practice, will verify all proposed Listed Domains with a listing price of $10,000 USD or more. By posting a Listed Domain with a Sale Price equal to or exceeding $10,000 USD, seller agrees that a reasonable verification delay may occur.
Afternic reserves the right to withhold from posting a Listed Domain for any reason.
Seller specifically authorizes and directs Afternic to sell a Listed Domain for the Buy Now Price at any time.
Seller makes the following representations and warranties to Afternic:
Seller represents and warrants that it is in fact the legal registrant and owner of each of its Listed Names, each free and clear of any encumbrances, liens of any nature, including third party intellectual property claims or registration fees due the Transferring Registrar (other than those created by the applicable registration agreement) ("Liens");
Seller hereby authorizes and legally empowers Afternic to offer each Listed Name for sale via Fast Transfer, and upon completion of the sale, seller shall pass good and marketable title to buyer free and clear of any Liens;
each Sold Domain shall be immediately transferable from the Transferring Registrar, without restriction; and
Seller has no actual knowledge that any Listed Domain is the subject of an intellectual property claim of any third party.
Seller acknowledges that Afternic is relying upon these representations in offering the Listed Domain for sale via Fast Transfer.
Seller is prohibited from rejecting/cancelling a completed sale to a buyer once a buyer commits to the purchase of a Listed Domain by clicking the 'confirmation' button on the Afternic, BuyDomains or Reseller/Partner site.
Seller may change the Buy Now Price at any time; provided however, seller understands and agrees that by changing the Buy Now Price, the Listed Domain(s) is subject to a new valuation by Afternic. In addition, due to the nature of e-commerce and the internet, Afternic is unable to guarantee that any change to the Buy Now Price shall be published on Afternic and its reseller sites before an offer is received. Seller is obligated to complete a transaction with a confirmed buyer for the posted price even if seller tried to increase the Buy Now Price prior to the time of the purchase.
Seller understands and agrees that the Listed Domain may, at Afternic’s discretion, be made available to Afternic's Fast Transfer reseller partners. Afternic does not warrant or guarantee that a specific Listed Domain will be displayed or offered for sale by a particular Reseller Partner.
Seller shall pay Afternic the applicable commission according to the fee schedule available at http://www.afternic.com/domain-help#1. Sales are not final until seven (7) days after the transaction has been completed.
Seller specifically authorizes and directs Afternic to act as its Designated Agent when a Listed Domain sells. As Designated Agent, Afternic will facilitate the transfer and change of domain name contact information for the Sold Domain. As such, Seller grants Afternic the power to explicitly consent to the material change of registrant contact information in order to facilitate immediate transfer of the Sold Domain.
Buyer specifically authorizes and directs Afternic to act as its Designated Agent. As Designated Agent, Afternic will facilitate the transfer and change of domain name contact information for the Purchased Domain. As such, Buyer grants Afternic the power to explicitly consent to the material change of registrant contact information to facilitate immediate transfer of the Purchased Domain.
C. Afternic Payment Terms; Fraud Notices
Afternic will remit payment of the purchase price for a Sold Domain to the seller after the expiration of seven (7) days of the purchase of the Sold Domain, net of the twenty applicable commission according to the fee schedule available at http://www.afternic.com/domain-help#1, except where Afternic has received a Fraud Notice from its reseller partner.
In the case where a Fraud Notice has been issued and there is no possibility of a dispute resolution procedure, within seven (7) days, Afternic or its Reseller Partners shall cancel the sale transaction and make reasonable commercial efforts to return the Listed Domain back to the Transferring Registrar and under seller's control.
In the event that a credit card company notifies Afternic or one of our Fast Transfer partners of a chargeback, upon prompt notification and return of the sold name in question to Afternic, Afternic or one of our Fast Transfer partner shall have the right to request a refund of the sale price minus the commission already received, or, in the alternative, a refund of the actual amount remitted to Afternic for the sold name, provided, however, that such request is made within one-hundred eighty (180) days from the date of purchase of the relevant name(s). In such cases, our Fast Transfer partners shall return the listed name(s) to Afternic. Our Fast Transfer partners may neither seek a refund nor return the sold name(s) to Afternic one-hundred eighty (180) days after the date of purchase.
Seller acknowledges that it understands and agrees that seller's sole remedy, and Afternic's sole liability, in the event that the sale transaction is cancelled, or a Fraud Notice is received, is a return of the Sold Domain to seller's control. Afternic provides no warranty of any kind to seller. Seller acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a cancelled sale, Afternic's sole obligation, and seller's sole remedy, is limited to the return of the Sold Domain to seller's control unless Afternic is barred from taking such action due to legal or registry requirements.
TERMS FOR BIDDING ON EXPIRING DOMAIN NAMES IN THE AFTERNIC AUCTION
Afternic Expiring Domain Name Auctions have two phases: the preorder period and the live auction period. During the preorder period, before a name is in live auction, you can place a preorder on a domain name. This preorder ensures that: 1) the name will go to auction unless it is withdrawn, and 2) you will be included in the auction once it goes live. A PreOrder is a bid placed on an expiring domain before its live auction begins. At least one member must preorder the domain in order for it to go to auction. Once the domain auction begins, your preorder bid is legally binding. You can only delete your preorder before the start of the live auction.
For reasons beyond our control a domain name listed during the preorder period may become unavailable. Afternic is not an escrow agent. Therefore, Afternic cannot guarantee that a preordered domain name will become available in an auction and has no liability if a domain name for which you have submitted a preorder is withdrawn and is not available at auction, If a name is withdrawn from the Afternic Expiring Domain Names Auction, your preorder will be cancelled. Your credit card is not charged until you actually win and pay for a domain, so you will not incur any fees if a domain name for which you have submitted a preorder is withdrawn by Afternic.
If one or more Afternic customers have preordered a particular domain, Afternic will conduct an auction for the domain, and the domain will subsequently be awarded to the highest bidder in such auction. If you are the winning bidder when the auction ends, you are obligated to pay the amount of your winning bid.
If one or more Afternic customers have preordered a particular domain and in the course of the subsequent auction no bids are placed, Afternic will award the domain to the customer with the highest preorder amount.
If two or more customers preorder a domain for an identical amount, then the customer who submitted his or her preorder first will be the current highest bidder for such domain when the auction begins. If there are no subsequent bids on such domain name in the auction, then the domain will be awarded to the customer who placed his or her preorder first.
Once you confirm your preorder or your bid, if you bid on a name through our "bid now" feature, you have made a legally binding bid on the domain name, and if there are no other bidders or higher bidders you have agreed to purchase the domain.
The start time and end time that is set for an auction is an estimate. Actual start and end times may vary somewhat. An auction for a domain name will be extended by five additional minutes if in the final five minutes before the announced end time a new bid is received for the particular domain name being auctioned.
While Afternic will use reasonable commercial efforts to provide information to you via email regarding your preorder and bids for a domain name, Afternic cannot guarantee that all such emails will be delivered to you and we caution you not to rely solely on email for the status of a domain name. Information that we will endeavor to send you via email will also be posted to your 'My Afternic' account.
Afternic may in our sole discretion require the winning bidder to tender payment to us in a manner of our choosing, including but not limited to credit card or wire transfer. Payments and fees collected by Afternic for the purchase of an auctioned domain name are non-refundable, in whole or in part. In the event of a charge reversal or chargeback by a credit card company or other payment provider, or if we determine in our sole discretion that we are unable or unlikely to collect payment, any associated domain registration will immediately terminate and/or the domain name registration will be transferred to Afternic as the paying entity for the registration. Afternic may, in our sole discretion, award the reclaimed domain name to the next highest bidder in the relevant auction and charge such bidder their highest bid amount, or make the domain name subject to a new auction among bidders determined by Afternic, or otherwise dispose of the name.

Afternic Domain Name Registration Agreement
Updated on January 31, 2006
This Registration Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of domain name registration and related services ("Services"). In this Agreement "you" and "your" refer to you and the registrant listed in the WHOIS contact information for the domain name. "We", "us" and "our" refer to the registrars listed at the bottom of this document, any one of which will be the registrar for your domain name and all of which share common ownership, common terms and conditions, and a shared Services infrastructure. To determine which registrar your domain name is registered with, perform a WHOIS lookup at http://www.uwhois.com. You obtain the Services first through a Primary Service Provider, Afternic, Inc., with whom we have a wholesale relationship. Your relationship with your Primary Service Provider may be governed by additional terms, as you and your Primary Service Provider may agree. "We," "us" and "our" does not include your Primary Service Provider, except when specifically mentioned or unless your Primary Service Provider is one of us (i.e. if your Primary Service Provider is also one of the registrars listed at the bottom of this document).
YOU AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT: By using the Service(s), you agree to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, the UDRP (define below) and the rules, policies, or agreements published in association with specific of the Service(s) and/or which may be enforced by ICANN, the registries, and governments.
PASSAGE OF TIME: This Agreement will change over time. If, as a result of such a change, you no longer agree with the terms of this Agreement, you agree that your exclusive remedy is to transfer your domain name registration services to another registrar or request of us that we cancel your domain name registration services. If you continue to use the Services following a change in this Agreement and/or the Services, your continued use of the Services indicates your consent to the changes. Any such revision or change will be binding and effective within 30 days of when the revised Agreement or change to the Service(s) is posted to the website of either the Primary or Backend Service Providers, or 15 days after you view the revised Agreement or 15 days after notification is sent to the e-mail address provided in association with your domain name registration. You agree to review this Agreement periodically to make yourself aware of any such revisions.
YOUR ACCOUNT: You must create an account to use the Services. Your account is typically going to be managed and/or provided by your Primary Service Provider. You are responsible for maintaining and updating all login IDs, passwords, and for all access to and use of your account by you or any third party.
SERVICE(S) PROVIDED AT WILL AND TERMINATION OF SERVICE(S): We and your Primary Service Provider may reject your domain name registration application or elect to discontinue providing Service(s) to you for any reason within 30 days of a Service initiation or a Service renewal. Outside of this period, we and your Primary Service Provider may terminate or suspend the Service(s) at any time for cause, which, without limitation, includes registration of prohibited domain name(s), abuse of the Services, payment irregularities, serious allegations of illegal conduct, or if your use of the Services involves us in a violation of any Internet Service Provider's ("ISP's") acceptable use policies, including the transmission of unsolicited bulk email. You agree that if we terminate or suspend the Services provided to you under this Agreement, that we may then, at our option, make either ourselves or a third party the beneficiary of Services which are substantially similar to those which were previously providing to you and that any reference in this Agreement to termination or suspension of the Services to you includes this option. If we have grounds to terminate or suspend Service(s) with respect to one domain name or in relation to other Service(s) provided through your account, we may terminate or suspend all Service(s) provided through your account, including Service(s) to other domain names. No fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Service(s) for cause. At any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services 30 days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain name registration. Following notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name or risk that we may delete your domain name or suspend or modify Services to it. If we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will attempt to refund your fees. You further acknowledge and agree that your registration of a domain name is subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer by any ICANN procedure, by any registrar or registry administrator procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.
OUR SERVICES: We are accredited registrars with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") for Top Level Domain Names ("TLDs") (such as .com, .net, .org, .de, co.uk, etc.). ICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the TLDs. Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect. For a list of registry administrators and for more information on TLDs, see HYPERLINK http://www.icann.org/tlds/. Domain name registrations are only for limited terms, terms which end on the expiration date. For domain names which are created as a new registration out of the available namespace, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry; for domain names registrations which were not returned to the available namespace, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry. You agree that we and your Primary Service Provider are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration (our limitation of liability is explained further, below). You further agree that domain name registration is a service, that domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, and that domain name registration services do not create a property interest.
YOU WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES IS NOT GOING TO SUBJECT US TO ANY CLAIM(S). You further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, your Primary Service Provider, and applicable registry administrator(s) (including Verisign Inc., Neulevel, Inc., Public Interest Registry, Afilias Limited, and other registry operators listed at http://www.icann.org/registries/listing.html) and all such parties' directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages and reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of, or related to, the domain name registration services you are obtaining from us.
NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICES: Without limitation, the following are not included in the Services: We cannot and do not check to see whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you make of the domain name(s), or other of the Service(s), infringes legal rights of others. It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use infringes legal rights of others. We might be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name; it is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities. It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you. We will comply with court orders unless you contact us to contest the order.
IF LAWSUIT(S) ARE THREATENED: If we are sued or threatened with lawsuit in connection with Service(s) provided to you, we may turn to you to indemnify us and to hold us harmless from the claims and expenses (including attorney's fees and court costs). Under such circumstances, you agree that you will, upon demand, obtain a performance bond with a reputable bonding company or, if you are unable to obtain a performance bond, that you will deposit money with us to pay for our reasonably anticipated expenses in relation to the matter for the coming year. Such deposit will be drawn down as expenses are incurred, with all account notices sent to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain names and/or account. We shall not be obliged to extend you any credit in relation to such expenses and we may terminate the Services for a failure to make or renew such a deposit. We will return any unused deposit upon the later of one year from deposit or the conclusion of the matter.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: You agree to the Uniform Domain NameDispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP"), which is available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm and http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm . You agree that the UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN's successor) at any time. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party. You also agree that, in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP. You also understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and domain names because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding Services provided to you, you may loose your rights to receive the Services if you do not respond expeditiously to an email sent in conjunction therewith.
FEES: As consideration for the Service(s), renewal of the Service(s), and, if you select it, automatic renewal of the Service(s), you agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Service(s), the applicable Service(s) fees. All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund. At our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.
CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CHARGES: If you have an issue with credit card charges, you should contact your Primary Service Provider (if any), first, and us, secondarily, regarding the issue before you contact your credit card company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges. In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Service(s), you agree that we and/or your Primary Service Provider may suspend access to any and all accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider and that all rights to and interest in and use of any domain name registration(s) services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider shall be assumed by us or your Primary Service Provider, as the case may be. We will reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fee(s) and our then-current reinstatement fee, currently set at $200(US Dollars). Reinstatement of Service(s) by your Primary Service Provider may be according to the terms, if any, between you and your Primary Service Provider relating to reinstatement. Charges for the Service(s) which use our credit card payment processor will be identified on your credit card statement as "Domain Name Registration." We are not responsible for how charges appear on your credit card statement when the transaction is processed by your Primary Service Provider's or another third party's credit card payment processor.
EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE(S): You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire. As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may notify you via an email message or via your account when renewal fees are due. Should these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled. Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time. If you select automatic renewal of the Service(s), we may attempt to renew the Service(s) a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and that we are not required to, but that we may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.
ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION: As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s). You agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. With respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number. You agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed. Not providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s). You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name. If you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase "Name Only" Services, you agree that we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from "Name Only" Services.
YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION: In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third party's express consent to the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement. By registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose. You acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you. You further agree that your failure to respond for over ten (10) calendar days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of account and WHOIS contact information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Service(s) to you. As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may loose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.
ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT AND AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY: In order to change any of your account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your account with your Primary Service Provider (if any), or your account with us. Please safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use. You agree that any person in possession of you account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information. We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that informationand that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information. You agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT. If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.
TRANSFERS: You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, as this policy may be modified from time to time. You agree that we may place a "Registrar Lock" on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so. By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed. To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org). Alternatively, you should contact your Primary Service Provider to have your domain name(s) services locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode." If your Primary Service Provider is unresponsive, you may contact us to have your domain name(s) locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" though we may first contact your Primary Service Provider to request that the Primary Service Provider address the request. Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request. Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due. We will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN's transfer policies. Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed. A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request. You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry. AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.
PRIVACY POLICY: You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information. Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available. Information regarding ICANN's guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/index.html. You agree that we may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws. One of the ways that we may make some or all of the information you provide available to the public or third parties is by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us. Please click here if you would like your WHOIS information made available for bulk access. We reserve the right to discontinue providing bulk WHOIS data access to third parties.
OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION AND DATA: You agree and acknowledge that we own all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain name database, and all information and derivative works generated from the domain name database. You further agree and acknowledge that we own the following information for those registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration, (b) the expiration date of the registration, (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of all contacts for the domain name registration, (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain name that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database, and (e) any other information we generate or obtain in connection with the provision of domain name registration services, other than the domain name being registered, the IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name, and the corresponding names of those nameservers. We do not have any ownership interest in your specific personal registration information outside of our rights in our domain name database.
AGENTS AND LICENSES: You agree that, if you are registering a domain name for or on behalf of someone else, you represent that you have the authority to nonetheless bind that person as a principal to all terms and conditions provided herein. You agree that if you license the use of the domain name registered to you to a third party, you nonetheless remain the domain name holder of record, and remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing (and updating, as necessary) both your own full contact information, and accurate technical, administrative, billing and zone contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name and domain name registration.
USE OF FREE SERVICES: In consideration for providing additional optional Services for which we do not charge an additional fee, including, but not limited to, URL forwarding, email forwarding, free parking page, free website hosting, free email services, or other services which we may introduce from time to time but for which there is not a separate fee ("Free Services"), you agree that, if you use such Free Services, we may display advertising in conjunction therewith through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video steams, appendices to emails, or other similar advertising means, and that we may aggregate related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means. You agree that from time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) services ("Promotional Name(s)"). If we do so, the services for the Promotional Name(s) will be placed in the same account as your other domain name(s) and you will be listed as the registrant, though we may point the Promotional Name to IP address(es)of our choosing. If you want to assume control over the services provided to the Promotional Name, including the right to transfer or push the Promotional Name service to other registrars or other accounts or the ability to control the DNS settings for the Promotional Name, you must pay the promotional registration fee or renewal fee, if any, and agree to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Promotional Name(s). If you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may request that you be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we will be listed as the domain name registrant. Alternatively, you may contact us or your Primary Service Provider to request that we delete the Promotional Name from the namespace. For any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, you agree that we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid.
AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION: After expiration of the term of a domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry's database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.
After expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures or grace periods during which expired domain name registrations may be renewed. You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the end of a domain name registration term to attempt to renew the registration. You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in a post-expiration renewal of a domain name and that we shall not be liable therefore. You acknowledge that post-expiration renewal or redemption processes, if any, involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine. You acknowledge and agree that expired domain name(s) may be made available to be registered or re-registered to any party at any time.
You agree that after expiration of the term of a domain name registration we may, for a period of 30 days, either i) remove the domain name from the zone of the top-level-domain (meaning that the domain name will no longer resolve), or ii) direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) of website(s) designated by us, including, without limitation, to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine. You agree that either are functionally equivalent to ICANN's or a registry's redemption grace period, which would normally occur after deletion. If we exercise our rights under this provision, and if you do not transfer the domain name services to another registrar nor contact us to pay for and renew the domain name prior to the end of the 30 days, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name.
After this 30 day period, you agree that we may either (i) delete the domain name at any time thereafter or (ii) that we may pay the registry's registration free or otherwise allow it to continue to be registered with the WHOIS information previously provided by you and pointing to the name-server(s) and IP address(es) designated by us, and that we will not remove it from the TLD zone. In the latter event, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS information, provided that you pay a fee of $160 (US dollars). After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services, and that you are no longer the registrant of the domain name, and that we may list ourselves or another party as the registrant of the domain name in the WHOIS information. If we exercise our rights under this provision and you do not wish to be listed as the registrant and you wish to forego your option under this provision to pay to renew the domain name registration services for the then-current registration term, you may notify us before the end of the 120-day period and request that we remove your information from the WHOIS record for the domain name, in which case we, or a third party we designate, will be listed as the registrant, and in which case you relinquish all rights and control over the domain name services, and in which case we may i) continue to point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us, or ii) we may delete the domain name from the applicable registry's database.
Alternatively, if you do not contact us to renew the domain name registration services during the 30 day period described above, you agree that we may (i) delete the domain name at any time thereafter or (ii) we may put the domain name up for auction pursuant to the terms of our Pre-Release Names auction service, or (iii) pay the registry fee or otherwise allow it to continue to be registered with the WHOIS information previously provided by you and pointing to the name-server(s) and IP address(es) designated by us, and that we will not remove it from the TLD zone. In the latter event, the name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 90 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS information, provided that you pay a fee of $200 (US dollars). After the end of the 90-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services, and that you are no longer the registrant of the domain name, and that we may list ourselves or another party as the registrant of the domain name in the WHOIS information. If we exercise our rights under this provision and you do not wish to be listed as the registrant and you wish to forego your option under this provision to pay to renew the domain name registration services for the then-current registration term, you may notify us before the end of the 90-day period and request that we remove your information from the WHOIS record for the domain name, in which case we, or a third party we designate, will be listed as the registrant, and in which case you relinquish all rights and control over the domain name services, and in which case we may i) continue to point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us, or ii) we may delete the domain name from the applicable registry's database.

IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR REGISTRATION OF THE DOMAIN NAME, BUT IN NO EVENT GREATER THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ($400.00 US Dollars). BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
INDEMNITY: With respect to ICANN, the registry operators, us, and your Primary Service Provider, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates of such parties, you agree to release, indemnify, and hold such parties harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Service(s) provided hereunder, or your use of the Service(s), including, without limitation, infringement by you, or by anyone else using the Service(s) we provide to you, of any intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of our operating rules or policies relating to the Service(s) provided. When we may be involved in a suit involving a third party and which is related to our Service(s) to you under this Agreement, we may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to indemnify and hold us harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph. Such written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment. Your failure to provide such assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of this Agreement by you and may, in our sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which we are the registrar of record. This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the UDRP.
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOU REPRESENT THAT, TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF, NEITHER THE REGISTRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME NOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED NOR THE USE OF OTHER OF THE SERVICE(S) INFRINGES THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.

WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER THAT REGISTRATION OR USE OF A DOMAIN NAME UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL IMMUNIZE YOU EITHER FROM CHALLENGES TO YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, OR FROM SUSPENSION, CANCELLATION OR TRANSFER OF THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED TO YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR E-MAIL FORWARDING OR OTHER EMAIL SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL AND/OR DATA. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICE(S) OR ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICE(S). NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION FOR DISPUTES: Except as otherwise set forth in the UDRP or any similar ccTLD policy with respect to any dispute over a domain name registration this Agreement, your rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Washington, as if the Agreement was a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Washington. You agree that any action brought by you to enforce this Agreement or any matter brought by you and which is against or involves us and which relates to your use of the Services shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, or if there is no jurisdiction in such court, then in a state court in King County, Washington state.

THE FOLLOWING REGISTRARS ARE REFERRENCED IN THIS DOCUMENT:

Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy
(As Approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999
and implemented by Afternic, Inc., on October 1, 2005)
1. Purpose. This Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Policy") has been adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), is incorporated by reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party other than us (the registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by you. Proceedings under Paragraph 4 of this Policy will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Rules of Procedure"), which are available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm, and the selected administrative-dispute-resolution service provider's supplemental rules.
2. Your Representations. By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent an http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm, and the selected warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.
3. Cancellations, Transfers, and Changes. We will cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations under the following circumstances:
a. subjet to the provisions of Paragraph 8, our receipt of written or appropriate electronic instructions from you or your authorized agent to take such action;
b. our receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action; and/or
c. our receipt of a decision of an Administrative Panel requiring such action in any administrative proceeding to which you were a party and which was conducted under this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN. (See Paragraph 4(i) and (k) below.) We may also cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with the terms of your Registration Agreement or other legal requirements.
4. Mandatory Administrative Proceeding.
This Paragraph sets forth the type of disputes for which you are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding. These proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative-dispute-resolution service providers listed at http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm (each, a "Provider").
a. Applicable Disputes. You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a "complainant") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that
(i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and
(ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and
(iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.
In the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.
b. Evidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith. For the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:
(i) circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or
(ii) you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or
(iii) you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or
(iv) by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location.
c. How to Demonstrate Your Rights to and Legitimate Interests in the Domain Name in Responding to a Complaint. When you receive a complaint, you should refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response should be prepared. Any of the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii):
(i) before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or
(ii) you (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or
(iii) you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.
d. Selection of Provider. The complainant shall select the Provider from among those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider. The selected Provider will administer the proceeding, except in cases of consolidation as described in Paragraph 4(f).
e. Initiation of Proceeding and Process and Appointment of Administrative Panel. The Rules of Procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a proceeding and for appointing the panel that will decide the dispute (the "Administrative Panel").
f. Consolidation. In the event of multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to the first Administrative Panel appointed to hear a pending dispute between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate before it any or all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that the disputes being consolidated are governed by this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN.
g. Fees. All fees charged by a Provider in connection with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid by the complainant, except in cases where you elect to expand the Administrative Panel from one to three panelists as provided in Paragraph 5(b)(iv) of the Rules of Procedure, in which case all fees will be split evenly by you and the complainant.
h. Our Involvement in Administrative Proceedings. We do not, and will not, participate in the administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative Panel. In addition, we will not be liable as a result of any decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.
i. Remedies. The remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration to the complainant.
j. Notification and Publication. The Provider shall notify us of any decision made by an Administrative Panel with respect to a domain name you have registered with us. All decisions under this Policy will be published in full over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in an exceptional case to redact portions of its decision.
k. Availability of Court Proceedings. The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration should be canceled or transferred, we will wait ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our principal office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We will then implement the decision unless we have received from you during that ten (10) business day period official documentation (such as a copy of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have commenced a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure. (In general, that jurisdiction is either the location of our principal office or of your address as shown in our Whois database. See Paragraphs 1 and 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation within the ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and we will take no further action, until we receive (i) evidence satisfactory to us of a resolution between the parties; (ii) evidence satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your domain name.
5. All Other Disputes and Litigation. All other disputes between you and any party other than us regarding your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of Paragraph 4 shall be resolved between you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.
6. Our Involvement in Disputes. We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name. You shall not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding. In the event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defenses deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend ourselves.
7. Maintaining the Status Quo. We will not cancel, transfer, activate, deactivate, or otherwise change the status of any domain name registration under this Policy except as provided in Paragraph 3 above.
8. Transfers During a Dispute.
a. Transfers of a Domain Name to a New Holder. You may not transfer your domain name registration to another holder (i) during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded; or (ii) during a pending court proceeding or arbitration commenced regarding your domain name unless the party to whom the domain name registration is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be bound by the decision of the court or arbitrator. We reserve the right to cancel any transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that is made in violation of this subparagraph.
b. Changing Registrars. You may not transfer your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded. You may transfer administration of your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that the domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy. In the event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name registration was transferred.
9. Policy Modifications.
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time with the permission of ICANN. We will post our revised Policy at www.afternic.com/udrp.php at least thirty (30) calendar days before it becomes effective. Unless this Policy has already been invoked by the submission of a complaint to a Provider, in which event the version of the Policy in effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose before, on or after the effective date of our change. In the event that you object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name registration with us, provided that you will not be entitled to a refund of any fees you paid to us. The revised Policy will apply to you until you cancel your domain name registration.

Afternic Privacy Policy
Updated December 12, 2019
Afternic, a division of GoDaddy.com LLC, cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and
use personal information only as needed to deliver our products, services, websites and mobile applications,
and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, our “Services”). Your
personal information includes information such as:
Name
Address
Telephone number
Date of birth
Email address
Billing and payment information
Candidate information (for job applicants)
Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.
Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but also
how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information.
If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach
our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at
privacy@afternic.com. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience
that you can confidently trust.
What information we collect, how we collect it, and why
Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:
i.	create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);
ii.	request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number);
iii.	complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
iv.	participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.
These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about
what these might be (as they vary from time to time):
Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track
your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including
analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services. These technologies automatically collect data when
you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, page load time, server
response time, and approximate location information to measure website performance and improve our systems,
including optimizing DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations. Specifically, interactions with
the features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within
the Services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used,
information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about
devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings,
application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is collected. All this allows us to provide you with
more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect,
analyze and improve the performance of our Services. We may also collect your location (IP address) so that we
can personalize our Services. For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize,
please visit our Cookie Policy. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here [or if located in
the European Union click here]. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
Supplemented Data may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available
databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with
information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records,
assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and
services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give
us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
How we utilize information.
We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for
which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with,
or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:
Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services.
We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize
this information to:
Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems
Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services
Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.
Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not
linked to any personal information.
Sharing with trusted third parties. We may share your personal information with affiliated
companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to
integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary
for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
Processing credit card payments
Serving advertisements
Conducting contests or surveys
Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics
Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
Customer relationship management
Recruiting support and related services.
We only share your personal information as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or
as needed on our behalf. These third parties (and any subcontractors they may be permitted to use) are subject
to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilizing, sharing or retaining your
personal information for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your
consent).
We may also share your information with third parties for the purpose of facilitating / allowing a merger,
acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, in which case the acquiring company may continue
to utilize your data in the manner for which it was provided and intended.
Communicating with you. We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider
regarding products or services you have signed up or purchased from us, such as necessary to deliver
transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we
think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests. You don’t
need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services. These contacts may include:
Email
Text (SMS) messages
Telephone calls
Messenger applications (e.g. WhatsApp, etc.)
Automated phone calls or text messages.
You may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving communications from us and/or our
partners by signing into your account and visiting “Account Settings” page.
If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of
collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies. In addition, it will describe any
choice options you have in regards to the use and/or sharing of your personal information with a co-branded
partner, as well as how to exercise those options. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the
content of third-party sites. Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. using email marketing services to send
emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information for the requested
service. If you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request
that it be removed from our database, please contact us at privacy@afternic.com.
Transfer of personal information abroad. If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, or when the appropriate standard contractual clauses are in place. Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.
Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests. We cooperate with government
and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole
discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests),
to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the
public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that
we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process. We will also
share your information to the extent necessary to comply with any ICANN, registry or ccTLD rules, regulations and
policies when you register a domain name with us. For reasons critical to maintaining the security, stability and
resiliency of the Internet, this includes the transfer of domain name registration information to the underlying
domain registry operator and escrow provider, and publication of that information as required by ICANN in the
public WHOIS database or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate legal interest to such information.
How we secure, store and retain your data.
We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during
transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate.
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and
thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:
mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or
needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal information, you can contact us at
privacy@afternic.com.
How you can access, update or delete your data.
To easily access, view, update, delete or port your personal information, or to update your subscription
preferences, please sign into your Account and visit “Account Settings.”
If you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is necessary for the products or services
you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services
purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.
If you are unable for any reason to access your Account Settings, you may also contact us by one of the methods
described in the “Contact Us” section below.
The E.U-U.S and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.
Our parent company, GoDaddy Operating Company, LLC (and our related entities, including GoDaddy.com, LLC, Blue
Razor Domains, LLC, Starfield Technologies, LLC, Domains by Proxy, LLC, Outright, Inc., Mad Mimi, Inc. and Media

Framework. GoDaddy Operating Company, LLC is committed to subjecting all personal information received from the
EU or Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To

Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Afternic complies with
the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland,
including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, Afternic
is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations,
Afternic may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities,
including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration
when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Afternic commits to resolve complaints about our collection or
use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy
Shield policy should first contact us in any manner provided in the "CONTACT US" section below in this
Privacy Policy.
Afternic has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities
(DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved
Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context
of the employment relationship.
‘Do Not Track’ notifications.
Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a “Do Not Track”
signal. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track”
signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
Age restrictions.
Our Services are available for purchase only for those over the age of 18. Our Services are not targeted to,
intended to be consumed by or designed to entice individuals under the age of 18. If you know of or have reason
to believe anyone under the age of 18 has provided us with any personal information, please contact us.
Non-Discrimination.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted under applicable
laws, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Changes to this policy.
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we
will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware
of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make
material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home
page, at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the changes.
