You shall be solely responsible for User Content you submit and the consequences of our or our Service Providers posting or publishing such User Content. We and our Service Providers also reserve the right to decide whether User Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use for copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, as well as other violations, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. We or our Service Providers may remove such User Content and/or terminate your access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion.

(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the Service Provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
