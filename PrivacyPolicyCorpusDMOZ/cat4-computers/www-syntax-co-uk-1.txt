Good products and well presented
Michael Silva 08:22 20 Oct 19
Great service! Thank you
L Pattinson 12:27 19 Aug 19
An excellent company to work with. 10 out of 10
Matt McKenna 15:05 15 Aug 19
The best IT support company we've ever used. Our online business was in desperate need of some help to secure our internal network and revise our Microsoft set up. Syntax delivered that and have been very accommodating with all our requests.
Jonathan Davies 14:07 15 Aug 19
We approached Syntax IT Support London as we were having issues from our current IT outsourcing provider that wasn't meeting our needs and requirements. Having a business that is very IT led and dependent means that downtime or issues with systems has a direct knock on affect to all areas of the business. We were very pleased with their refreshing approach to how to handle our operations and how they would implement these changes. It's now been over 2 months with Syntax and everyone has been very easy and professional and dramatically changed our business for the better. We are now looking at Office 365 migration with them over the next 3 months as we believe we will really benefit from these recommendations. We have now worked with 2 other well known IT support providers in London and Syntax stand out above every other company we've tried or spoken with. We are currently very happy with their service and won't be going elsewhere.

Syntax helped transform and streamline our IT processes. As a growing business we needed a company that could help connect our office systems in to the cloud. We now have a much easier, reliable and set up. Their 24/7 IT support service means we're never alone or have issues that can't be fixed immediately.
Tom Smith 16:19 20 Mar 19
Syntax IT Support London transformed our operation and streamlined our IT processes. Their knowledge regarding g cloud, office 365 is second to none.

very good it support company
Sarah Mann 08:45 04 Apr 17
After being let down by our previous IT support company we decided to look for a new provider that could offer the immediate support we require. After meeting with Syntax we knew that we had found the right company to support our growing business needs. We have been using Syntax Integration for more than 10 months and their team of IT support specialists have been fantastic. Look no further!
Blaise Rochester 08:44 04 Apr 17
We have been using Syntax Integration for over 5 months since we changed from our last provider. We have found them to be very approachable and have correct many issues including our out dated server for media storage.
I would have no hesitation in recommending them to any one who is looking to get a first rate service.
Samantha Roberts 21:10 17 Mar 17
Thank you Syntax we really appreciate all you've done to help
Peter Wainright 13:36 13 Mar 17
Our business relies heavily on our IT infrastructure and ensuring that our systems are working correctly at all times. Previously we had employed 3 IT technicians who handled the day to day business but as our business grew so did our demands in terms of support and testing. In order to scale our business further we needed to find an IT company who could work with our team and ensure that our needs were met. We have been using Syntax for over 5 months and we couldn't be happier with the service they have provided. We are now running Office 365 and Azure and it has massively streamlined out business.
Tom Peary 21:08 14 May 16
Look after all my IT issues. When our business grew and needed to migrate our office 365 to the cloud syntax made it simple and stress free
Steve Bruce 13:17 12 Feb 16
Syntax offer a transparent and streamlined IT service which our business could not operate properly without. We are very happy with the service and will continue to use.
Mark Struder 20:22 11 Feb 13
Our business is very dependent on our IT infrastructure, and it's extremely important that we have a reliable provider who can deliver the goods when it is most needed, even if this is out of hours. Excellent service!
Lindsay Wooler 13:32 11 Feb 13
A professional IT support from Syntax Integration Ltd is what we have had for 2 years. We will continue to recommend them to all our of network and clients due to their superior level of support service. We have used other London IT companies but have never been 100% satisfied until now - their ervices are unrivalled in our books.
Philip Pollock 10:58 20 Sep 10
We outgrew our exiting IT support provider and tried Syntax instead. So far they have been responsive, professional and helpful.
