Corporate Governance
We aim to implement corporate governance best practice where possible. We operate under transparent organisational, management and Executive Board structures.
We have clear and open communication channels regarding our operations. There is also a clear division of responsibilities and duties between members, the Executive Board and the management team, as stated in the RIPE NCC Articles of Association.
