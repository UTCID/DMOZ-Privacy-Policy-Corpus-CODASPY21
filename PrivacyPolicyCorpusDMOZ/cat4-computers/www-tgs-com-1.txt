TGS may update the TOU at any time without further notice. TGS may also make improvements or changes in the products, services or programs described in or accessed through this website at any time without notice. By using this website or by clicking to accept the TOU when prompted to do so, you agree to and accept the latest version of the TOU.  In the event of a conflict between the TOU and any supplement to a master license agreement which contains its own terms of use, the TOU takes precedence.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
Through its website, TGS provides users with access to a variety of resources, including log-in portals to secure areas which may provide access to seismic, well, or other data, products, or services, download areas, map displays, seismic displays, well log information, and product information (collectively the “Services”). The Services, including any updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new web properties, are subject to the TOU. Your use of any TGS Services is additionally governed by your relevant customer agreement with TGS.
INTERNAL USE LIMITATION
Unless otherwise specified, the Services are to be used solely for users’ internal use. Users may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, software, products or services obtained from the Services.
OWNERSHIP; PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN SERVICES
The Services are owned and operated by TGS. All content on the TGS website such as text, images, logos, audio clips, button icons, graphics, design, compilations, analytics, computer code (including source code or object code), TGS data, as well as other elements of the Services are the intellectual property of TGS and or its licensors and or its content providers and are protected under applicable laws. Except as authorized in your customer agreement, you may not use any material from the Services. TGS reserves all rights to any materials not granted expressly in your customer agreement or by the Services. Secure areas of this website are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. We retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to our technology. From time to time, you may choose to submit feedback to us. We may, in connection with any Services, freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No feedback will be considered your confidential information, and nothing in this TOU limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating feedback or otherwise.
NOTICE SPECIFIC TO DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE ON THIS WEBSITE
Permission to use documents (such as white papers, press releases, maps, seismic samples, datasheets, and FAQs) from publicly available areas of the website is granted, provided that (1) the copyright notice indicated below at the end of the TOU appears in all copies, and that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear, (2) use of such documents is for informational and internal use only and they will not be copied or posted on any network computer or broadcast in any media, and (3) no modifications of any documents are made. Use for any other purpose is expressly prohibited by law and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.
Documents specified above do not include the design or layout of the TGS website or any other TGS owned, operated, licensed, or controlled website. Elements of the TGS websites are protected by trade dress, trademark, unfair competition, and other laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part.

MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
If any of the Services require you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete, and accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration form. You also will either receive or choose a password and a user name. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. You must require that all your authorized users keep their user log-in credentials and passwords strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, and with your log-in credentials and passwords. You agree to notify TGS immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. TGS will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by TGS or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time, unless you have the permission of that account holder. You may add additional authorized users as permitted by the terms and conditions of your customer agreement.
