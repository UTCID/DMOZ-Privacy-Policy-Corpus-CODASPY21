Disclosure and Sharing of Information
We disclose Tax Return Information in accordance with your requests, such as when you direct us to file a tax return with the IRS or to a state taxing authority or you provide your express consent to disclose information to a third party offering its own product or service.
In certain situations, TaxAct may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We also may share information about you as follows:
With vendors, consultants and other service providers who are required to use and disclose such information only to perform services on our behalf;
To taxing authorities, law enforcement, government agencies and others if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;

In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.

Examples may include, but are not limited to: the total number of users served by a TaxAct product/service, general age group ratios, summary reports of tax preparation practices across large groups of customers, and other statistical data relating to tax preparation and electronic filing service.
Links to Other Websites
Our Services may contain links to third party websites. Each of these links is clearly identified and will direct you from TaxAct's website to a third-party site. We do not direct or oversee the policies, procedures, or other practices for companies other than TaxAct. We do not endorse the products and services that are offered by third party companies. Some of these third-party sites may collect information about you or request personal information from you. If accessing a third party site via a link you will be subject to the policies and procedures that have been established by the third party. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what information is collected, how it is used, and how it is stored.
You can choose to permit or restrict third party websites that integrate with our Services. If you elect, you may enter your credentials to permit files to be imported to TaxAct. In doing so, TaxAct may receive your user name and email address for such third party website, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to TaxAct to facilitate the integration.
Our Services includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Communications and Opt-Out Options
We may periodically send you communications or otherwise contact you about new products, services, or upcoming events. You may choose to be removed from our electronic mailing list by following the instructions in those messages or by contacting TaxAct using one of the methods listed at the top of this page (email, phone, or mail) to request that you be removed from our marketing list. Note, however, that even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we will still contact you for non-marketing purposes (such as account information, feedback or research purposes, legal notices, account security, bug alerts, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxAct products and services).
TaxAct may use your mobile number to provide text message alerts for product information, tips or promotions, or other marketing activities. You agree that by providing your mobile phone number you expressly consent to receive automated marketing text messages from us to the mobile phone number provided. Message and data rates will apply and you should check the rates of your mobile carrier. You can opt out from further text marketing communications by texting STOP to the SMS number used by TaxAct to contact you.
We may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the above activities, but we will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. Text Messages are distributed via third party mobile network providers and, therefore, we cannot control certain factors relating to message delivery. We do not claim or guarantee availability or performance of this service, including liability for transmission delays or message failures.
Upon request (see “For Further Information” section), TaxAct will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access, correct or deactivate your account information by visiting www.taxact.com and selecting "Sign In" or by contacting us at the email address provided above. In certain jurisdictions you have the right to request access and receive information about the Personal Information we maintain about you, even if you are not a registered user, to update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, or to have the information deleted. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
If you e-file your tax return, you will not be able to update your tax return information once your tax return has been filed, unless the IRS rejects the return. You may check if your return has been accepted or rejected by selecting
Check e-file status.
If you delete or deactivate your account, you may no longer be able to access any of the information associated with that account including information you provided through associated applications or other Services. If you choose an available option to deactivate your account, rather than deleting your account, we retain your account information in our archives even though it is no longer accessible online. We retain all printed or e-filed returns and related information as necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
After the tax return extension filing deadline, all TaxAct tax returns are archived. We provide the ability for you to access your archived return in certain circumstances.
Security Measures
We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, alteration and destruction by using industry standard safeguards, procedures, and practices. These safeguards include physical, logical and technical protections for physical security; information security; and additional measures to restrict access to data we hold in physical and electronic forms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to those on a need to know basis and we encrypt credit card information when it's transmitted to us. Your access to the Services is password-protected with complex password requirements, security questions, and authentication by email or mobile phone. You should use a unique password and should not share your password with anyone. Additional details on our security measures can be found here: https://www.taxact.com/Security/.
Interest-Based Ads
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Data gathered from one site may be combined with data from other websites, mobile applications, and sources. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out of interest-based ads by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance at: http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and opting out via one browser, device, or app may not necessarily opt you out of collection from all browsers, devices, or apps. You will continue to receive ads but they will not be targeted to your interests. Certain web browsers allow users to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services by enabling the Do Not Track (“DNT”) privacy preference. We do not respond to a user's "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser request, given that we cannot control the DNT handling of third parties interacting with our site.

If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our collection and use of your Personal Information.
