Terms of Service
LAST REVISION: May 11, 2012
PLEASE READ THIS SPAM ARREST TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
This Spam Arrest Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") governs the provision of the Services (as defined below) by Spam Arrest LLC ("Spam Arrest") to you.
Spam Arrest reserves the right to change or revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time by posting any changes or a revised Agreement on this site (spamarrest.com). Spam Arrest will alert you that changes or revisions have been made by indicating on the top of this Agreement the date it was last revised. The changed or revised Agreement will be effective immediately after it is posted on this Web site. Your use of the Services following the posting of any such changes or of a revised Agreement will constitute your acceptance of any such changes or revisions.
There are no refunds for any amount paid under this Agreement except in case of fraud (e.g. identity theft) or as required by law.
I.THE SERVICES
(a) Description. The Services include the blocking of emails from persons sending email to you ("Senders") prior to verification by Spam Arrest and related services (the "Services"). Spam Arrest will send one or more emails to Senders using your email address to verify and, if necessary, to re-verify Senders. Spam Arrest will use commercially reasonable efforts to block emails sent to you by unverified Senders during the Term (as defined below); provided, however, that Spam Arrest shall not provide Services to you if you elect not to pay the Fee (as defined below) following the conclusion of the Trial Period (as defined below). Spam Arrest reserves the right, without liability to you or any other third party, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, the Services without notice. In order to facilitate Spam Arrest's provisioning of the Services to you, YOU HEREBY GRANT SPAM ARREST A NON-EXCLUSIVE, ROYALTY-FREE LICENSE TO ACCESS THE EMAIL SERVER YOU DESIGNATE IN YOUR REGISTRATION DATA (DEFINED BELOW) AND COPY ANY EMAILS WITHIN SUCH SERVER AND TRANSFER THEM TO SPAM ARREST SERVERS.
(b) Free Trial Period. Spam Arrest will provide the Services to you for a thirty (30) day period free of charge (the "Trial Period"). The Trial Period will begin on the date you complete the registration process and end on the 30th day after that date.
(c) Six Month Initial Term. The term of this Agreement starts when you click on the “I Agree” button during account registration and continues during the Trial Period and for six months after the end of the Trial Period (the “Initial Term”). Upon the conclusion of the Trial Period, Spam Arrest will bill your credit card or PayPal account on file, without further notice to you, the fees stated on the registration page for the initial six-month term. If no credit card or PayPal account is on file Spam Arrest will notify you that the Trial Period has ended and payment is due.
(d) Automatic Renewal; Subsequent Terms. The Agreement will automatically renew, unless terminated by you thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term, for an additional six month period, or at your election, another Services period then offered by Spam Arrest, e.g. one month, one year, or two years (each a “Subsequent Term”). Similarly, the Agreement will automatically renew unless terminated by you thirty (30) days prior to the end of any Subsequent Term for a period equal to the current Subsequent Term, or at your election, another Services period then offered by Spam Arrest. The date thirty (30) days prior to the end of either the Initial Term or a Subsequent Term is referred to as the “Renewal Date.”
If you do not elect a Subsequent Term of a different period than your current term, then you agree to pay the same fees as for your current term. If you elect a Subsequent Term for a different period, you agree to pay the fees disclosed by Spam Arrest in connection with that different period.
If the fees for a Subsequent Term of the same duration as your current term (i.e. the Initial Term or the current Subsequent Term) will be greater than the fees charged for your current term, Spam Arrest will notify you seven (7) days prior to the Renewal Date and you may terminate the Services as of the end of the current term instead of renewing.
You authorize Spam Arrest to charge the credit card or PayPal account on file on the Renewal Date for an amount equal to the fees for the Subsequent Term unless you terminate the Services at the time you are notified of a change in the fees, if any, or as provided in Article VII below.
In order for your termination to be effective, you must provide notice by submitting the Cancellation Request Form. For security purposes, this is the only cancellation method permitted.
(e) Payment. Spam Arrest accepts American Express, Visa, Discover Card, MasterCard and PayPal. If, at any time thereafter, you fail to pay any amount under this Agreement when due or are otherwise in breach or default under this Agreement, Spam Arrest may, in its sole discretion, and without prejudice to its other rights, immediately terminate your use of the Services. In addition to the foregoing, if you fail to pay any amount under this Agreement when due, you will be charged a $7.50 late fee. Late payments hereunder will accrue interest at the rate of one and one half percent per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower. In the event you change your credit card information (e.g., credit card number or expiration date) or cancel the credit card or PayPal account on file with Spam Arrest, you will (1) promptly advise Spam Arrest of the change and provide an updated credit card or PayPal account that can be charged by Spam Arrest, and (2) pay any amount due to Spam Arrest for the Services.
(f) Termination of Agreement Following Trial Period. If you decline to continue the Services during the Trial Period, you will not be charged for the Services. However, you will be charged for fees to use the Service until such time as either you or Spam Arrest terminates this Agreement. If you wish to terminate this Agreement during the Trial Period, you must submit the Cancellation Request Form as this is the only method permitted to cancel the service for security purposes, as mentioned in paragraph (c).
(g) Unverified Message Fee. The first 100,000 unverified email messages stored per month are included with the Services. You agree that Spam Arrest may charge a fee of $0.25 for each additional 1000 messages, with a minimum fee of $0.25. You authorize Spam Arrest to charge this fee using the payment method you provided upon registration. Unverified Messages are messages stored in your Unverified Message Folder during a given month.
(h) Mail Storage FeeEvery account includes 1GB (1024MB) of Mail Storage Quota. You agree that Spam Arrest may charge a fee of $1.50 per additional GB per month, with a minimum charge of $1.50. You will be notified by email when your account reaches 95% of its storage limit -- this will allow you to take any necessary steps to avoid exceeding the Mail Storage Quota. The notification email process is simply a courtesy, and does not relieve you of the responsibility for monitoring your own storage use. You authorize Spam Arrest to charge this fee using the payment method you provided upon registration.
II.YOUR REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT
(a) Registration Obligations. In consideration for use of the Services, and to permit the creation of a Services account, you must provide Spam Arrest with certain information ("Registration Data") requested on the registration form; inquiries marked "required" must be answered, and any other request for information may be left blank. You agree that the Registration Data you provide: (1) is true, accurate, current, and complete, and (2) will be maintained and updated by you to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. Spam Arrest reserves the right to terminate your use of the Services and refuse to provide you with any and all current or future use of the Services if Spam Arrest, in its sole discretion, determines that any of your Registration Data is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.
(b) Additional Information Collected During Registration. As part of the registration process Spam Arrest's software may automatically collect certain information from your computer (including your Internet address, browser type, operating software, computer language and email type and other computer registry information). You will allow the Spam Arrest software to obtain this information and not to manipulate or falsify such information.
(c) Account Security. You will select a user name and password during the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password and are fully responsible for all activities, charges and/or liabilities that occur under your user name and password whether or not authorized by you. You will immediately notify Spam Arrest of any unauthorized use of your user name and password or any other breach of security. Spam Arrest cannot, and will not, be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.
III.YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
(a) Compliance With Laws, Regulations and Requirements. You will not use the Services for illegal purposes but will abide by and comply with (1) all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations in your use of the Services (including laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States), and (2) all requirements, procedures, policies and regulations of networks connected to the Services.
(b) Non-Interference. You will not interfere with or disrupt (a) the use and enjoyment of the Services by other users; or (b) the Services or servers or networks connected to the Services (including, without limitation, any attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems or networks connected to the Services).
(c) Excessive Use. You acknowledge that excessive use of network bandwidth or electronic storage associated with the Services risks degrading the quality of the Spam Arrest Services for other users or imposing undue costs on Spam Arrest. Spam Arrest may terminate or place reasonable restrictions on Your use of the Services if it determines, in its sole discretion, that your use of the Services is excessive. But in no circumstances will your use of the Services be deemed excessive if your use does not exceed the bandwidth and storage thresholds established in Section I.(g) and Section I.(h).
(d) Resale of the Service. You will not resell the Services or the use of or access to the Services. This restriction does not apply to either the API or Enterprise products.
(e) Report of Abuse. You will report any violations of the terms of this Agreement by other users of the Services of which you become aware by contacting Spam Arrest at abuse@spamarrest.com.
(f) Contacting Senders
.
You acknowledge that Spam Arrest may contact any Senders (including prior Senders listed in your email server or inbox) on your behalf in order to facilitate the provisioning of the services or in connection with Claims under Article XIII.
(g) All Undesired E-Mails May Not Be Blocked. You acknowledge that the Services are not guaranteed to block all undesired email from Senders and that you may continue to receive such emails. Further, you understand and acknowledge that despite the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts on the part of Spam Arrest, your emails may be delayed or inadvertently lost.
(h) Account Disputes and Unacceptability of Chargebacks. If you have a question about charges made to your account, please contact Spam Arrest immediately. You may request that Spam Arrest refund charges to your charge, credit or debit cards. Spam Arrest will review such request and respond within five (5) business days. However, you acknowledge and agree that chargebacks requested through your issuing bank are an unacceptable charge dispute resolution method. If you dispute the credit card charge that Spam Arrest charges for its services, Spam Arrest reserves the right to suspend your account as soon as Spam Arrest is informed of it. You agree to immediately pay to Spam Arrest any chargebacks of amounts originally charged to your charge, credit or debit cards, as well as for fees incurred by Spam Arrest for such chargebacks. Your responsibility for chargebacks and related fees will continue even if you have received the funds, and/or closed your account. Any chargeback fees, past due fees and costs will be sent to collections. If Spam Arrest's collection efforts fail, unpaid debts may be reported to the State of Washington, all available credit reporting agencies and Internet fraud databases.

(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement among you and Spam Arrest and supersedes any prior agreements pertaining to the subject matter contained herein.
(b) Effect of Waiver. The failure of Spam Arrest to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
(c) Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA.

(g) Heading. The section headings and titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
