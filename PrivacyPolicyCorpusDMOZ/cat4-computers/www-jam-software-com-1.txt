The application of products purchased from JAM Software is strictly forbidden if people may be harmed when the products fail.
Updates and support are free within the selected maintenance period after purchase. You are allowed to use the software as long as you want to. Once your maintenance has expired, you will no longer receive free updates or support. However, you always will be able to purchase a renewal for a reduced price in our customer area. Discontinuity of maintenance does not result in a termination of the license but has to be compensated through a reinstatement fee corresponding to the length of interruption. Maintenance includes support by email and phone during our business hours and the availability of the licensed software and installation keys. JAM Software provides technical support and manuals in German and English language only.
Choice of law, place of fulfillment and jurisdiction
The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, the UN sales law is excluded.
For consumers entering the contract not for business or professional reasons, the local laws apply only if the protection they guarantee is not overruled by local laws of the consumer's place of residence.
If the customer is a businessman or a legal entity of either public law or a special public fund, Trier, Germany, shall be the solely place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship.
The same rule applies if a customer has no general place of jurisdiction within the Federal Republic of Germany, or changes his general place of jurisdiction or place of residence to a place outside of the Federal Republic of Germany, or his place of residence is not known by the time the complaint is filed. This is subject to the proviso that JAM Software GmbH can also take legal action against the customer at any other legal place of jurisdiction.
The license agreement shown at installation of our software applies to all software as well. The licensing rules complement these terms and conditions. If terms and conditions and license agreement contradict each other, the license agreement applies.
