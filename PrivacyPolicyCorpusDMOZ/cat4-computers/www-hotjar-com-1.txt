To function properly, Hotjar stores first-party cookies on your visitor's browser. Cookies are either set by the Hotjar script, or by visiting Hotjar's website.
When you use the Hotjar script on your website, Hotjar cookies are responsible for displaying the correct content to your visitors without personally identifying anyone.
When you visit Hotjar's website, it is important to note that the Hotjar script is enabled on this website.
If you, as an internal user, are looking to not be tracked by Hotjar or any site that uses Hotjar, you may do so by following the steps on our  Do Not Track page.
I use the Hotjar script on my website. Should my users be aware of these cookies?
Since privacy laws vary from country to country, we recommend that you consult with your legal team or company to determine which cookies need to be listed on your site and whether or not a cookie manager should be utilized.

365 days
_hjid
Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.
365 days
_hjRecordingLastActivity
This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).
Session
_hjTLDTest
When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.
Session
_hjUserAttributesHash
User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
Session
_hjCachedUserAttributes
This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.
Session
_hjLocalStorageTest
This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie. The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created.
