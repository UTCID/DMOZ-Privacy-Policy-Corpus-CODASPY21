We do not use your e-mail address, postal address, or phone numbers for promotional communications.AppointmentQuest may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on AppointmentQuest; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AppointmentQuest or the users of AppointmentQuest services; or, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of AppointmentQuest services or the public.Personally identifiable information collected by AppointmentQuest may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which AppointmentQuest or its partners, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.Information SecurityAppointmentQuest secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. AppointmentQuest secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access. All sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number and other financial information) is stored in encrypted data format.When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number and other financial information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our enrollment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
