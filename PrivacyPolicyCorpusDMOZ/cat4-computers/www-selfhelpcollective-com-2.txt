YOUR Strength
Using the Collective Wisdom of ALL of Us!
Help Yourself Here – Then Get Involved & Help Others Too!
Hey, we do NOT believe in
gurus, here:
we...  believe...  in YOU!
We believe that YOU are
your own
guru, actually; believe that you should learn from others, but teach yourself! And to help you
do this – help you trust in yourself – I've put together this website, this collective wisdom of many:
Find self improvement advice here – articles & videos
Discover personal development tips – self-help tips & stories
Enjoy free inspirational quotes – famous, funny & forceful
Strength, Clarity, Ease - All Come From Understanding
So I have a surprise for you - 3 surprising FACTS, actually:
Nothing is ever "WRONG" with you, ever!
You just think that it is, sometimes (and then you try to 'fix' yourself)
But when you're not over-thinking, over-analysing, and over-relying on who you think you are ("Hello EGO!"), then you relax into Who You Actually Are, and you see/feel for yourself quite clearly, that...
- see 1.
And knowing the truth of these facts - no matter how temporarily - IS
the start of real, transformative understanding...
Whether you see the 'truth' of these facts right now, whether you understand, doesn't matter. You're here, on a guru-free self-help site, that advocates the wisdom of "looking within". That's no accident. I'll leave it at that, for now, and usher you along to these favourite SelfHelpCollective.com pages:
What people fear the most -
most common fears,
What inspires people the most - inspirational sports quotes, and
What people often turn to for help - self-hypnosis downloads.
Whilst gently making you aware that I now share what's known as the Inside-Out Understanding at my SMNash.com blog, for those interested in transcending self-help altogether... www.smnash.com/free/

Thank you for visiting my Guru-free Self Help Collective.
Honestly, though, I'm less of a fan of self-help than I used to be. I came across something known as the Inside-Out understanding (in Oct 2012) and now self-help feels like stale advice that misses a most vital point. And I talk much more about this at SMNash.com...
Still, thank you
Steve
PS I wrote this piece about self-awareness in Aug, 2018. As part of the 'Your Story' section of the site. And I liked what I wrote. And so I share a link to it, here, in case you like it too: Self-Awareness and Me.
PS And if you're a fan of inspirational quotes (and the inspiring answers that can come from within, by reading them) then I can highly recommend this to you:
