Codejock Software is dedicated to maintaining and updating our components to include
the latest GUI designs and features.
New updates will be posted periodically throughout the year for active customers to download.
Announcements for each release will be posted on our What's New page and
RSS feed.
Also, release notes are published for each
new version summarizing the changes made.
When's the Next Product Release?
At times, Codejock may offer estimated release dates for version updates to help our customers
plan for new features, but generally it is our policy to not provide
exact release dates.
If an estimated release date is provided, all estimated release dates for version updates are tentative and may change without
notice.
Since internal scheduling conflicts and/or other unforeseen issues may arise, we can
never guarantee an exact release date and therefore cannot be responsible for any delays that
may occur. Codejock Software is not responsible for your product releases.
When a Codejock
Software product is updated and released it will be announced on our What's New page and
RSS feed.
