Policy Violations
Policy Violations
Find users whose access rights violate policy and revoke excess entitlements.
Business Challenge
When user access to systems and applications is managed manually,
errors and inconsistencies are inevitable.
Administrators may not
be aware of pre-existing security entitlements or of all of an organization's
policies.
The result is users with:
Too many entitlements.
Mutually exclusive rights, violating segregation of duties policies.
Orphan and dormant accounts, which are no longer required.
Each of these problems may lead to a security compromise.
Hitachi ID Bravura Identity Solution
Bravura Identity can find and remove
orphan and dormant accounts.
Bravura Identity can test all access requests against
segregation of duties policies, to prevent new
violations.
It can also identify users with pre-existing violations.
Access certification
is used to invite business stake-holders to decide whether user
access rights remain business-appropriate.
Risk scores are used to
identify users whose access rights merit a closer inspection.
Bravura Identity helps organizations to find and remediate access rights
that violate policy.
