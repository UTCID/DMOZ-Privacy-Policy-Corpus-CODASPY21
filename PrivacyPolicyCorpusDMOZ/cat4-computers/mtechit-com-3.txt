High IT Support Call Volume
High IT Support Call Volume
Reduce the volume of IT support calls due to login problems -- intruder lockouts and forgotten passwords, PINs and encryption keys.
Business Challenge
Up to 40% of the call volume in a typical IT help desk is caused
by users who forget their password or accidentally trigger an
intruder lockout.
While these incidents are inexpensive to resolve,
their volume can easily represent 20% to 30% of total IT support costs.
Any organization wishing to reduce IT support cost or to redirect
expenditures from routine break/fix calls to more value-added
services must first address this problem.
Hitachi ID Bravura Pass Solution
Bravura Pass can synchronize user passwords, which can eliminate
up to 80% of problems experienced by users.
Bravura Pass can pre-empt password expiry and
prompt users to change passwords
on days and at times when they are less likely
to forget their new password.
This can eliminate 50% of
password problems.
Bravura Pass includes self-service password reset, which allows
users to resolve their own problems without calling the help
desk.
Bravura Pass allows the help desk to
resolve remaining password-related calls
much more quickly than before.
Using Bravura Pass, organizations can eliminate 90% or more of
password-related IT support costs.
