Commitment to Privacy
WebSTAT respects the sensitive nature of
the information you provide us. Our Privacy
Policy is designed to protect your personal
information while maximizing your access to
our services, both paid and free.
This Privacy Policy describes how we treat
the information we receive from you when you
sign up for an account. Please read the Privacy
Policy carefully because it governs how we
use the information you submit to us. If this
Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will
not use the information you have submitted
to us in a manner that is inconsistent with
the Privacy Policy under which the information
was originally collected.
How We Identify Who You Are
We track web sites, which are often maintained
by several different people. When you sign up
with us, we will use the email you provided as
the primary line of communication. We will recognize
any requests from your email account as being
from you.
The ownership of web sites also frequently
changes, and hence we will also accept the
URL as identification. We will recognize any
change to the web site as being done by you.
Any email from your website domain or listed
on your site we will recognize as being from
you.
How We Use Your Information
When you sign up for an account on WebSTAT,
you provide us with your website name, website
URL, name, time zone and email address. The
time zone is used to report statistics and
the name is used to address you. The URL and
email address is to identify you and contact
you. Email addresses are utilized only to notify
users of significant changes, to address support
concerns, or to resolve abuse issues.
If you sign up for a Premium account, you
will additionally provide us with your address,
phone number, website category and fax number.
The fax number is optional. We will use this
information to contact you if there are any
problems with your account. If you pay with
a credit card, we will collect the credit card
information, including the name and address
on the card, the credit card number and the
expiration date. If you pay with some other
method, we will collect the name and address
of the person paying for the account.
How We Do NOT Use Your Information
WebSTAT does not provide or sell any sensitive
user information to any third party, including
email addresses, credit card numbers, billing
information, street addresses, and phone numbers.  WebSTAT
does not promote, support, or tolerate email
spam!
Credit Card Information
WebSTAT is very careful with your credit
card information. When you enter your credit
card information, we will do so over a secure
connection. We will not display your credit
card information anywhere when you log in,
so you can allow people to see your statistics
without sharing your credit card information.
We will not send your credit card information
over email. If you need to send it to us, it
is suggested that you submit over our secure
connection.
Your Statistics
Your statistics are only available to you
and those with whom you have shared the password.
WebSTAT employees will also be able to view
your statistics for support and billing issues.
We will not share your statistics with any
third party.
If you choose to give your account public access,
then anyone will be able to view your statistics
that follows a public link or has your site id
number. They will not be able to see any of your
contact information.
Cookies
Cookies are used to facilitate page path tracking
and statistics on returning and unique visitors.
They are not used to collect personally identifiable
information about visitors. WebSTAT uses sessional
and permanent cookies to help track your visitor's
traffic patterns through your site. Session cookies
expire within a short period of time or when
you close your web browser.
With most Internet browsers, you can block
all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie
is stored. It is also possible to delete all
cookies from your computer's hard drive. Many
cookies can be deleted with no ill effect, but
some will contain information that will make
your subsequent visits to certain websites more
useful.
