DynEd's privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by DynEd anytime you interact with us, such as when you visit our website, when you use DynEd products and services, or when you call our sales or support representatives. Your privacy is important to us at DynEd, and we do our best to protect it.
Why we collect personal information
DynEd collects personal information to help us deliver a superior level of service and support. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you informed about product announcements, software updates and special offers.
If you subscribe to any of DynEd's electronic mailing lists, such as the e-Newsletter, DynEd may periodically send you the latest information on products and services. If you prefer not to receive such information, we recommend that you don't subscribe to the DynEd e-News newsletter.
What information we collect
Your personal information may help us give you better service in a number of ways. For example, we may ask for your personal information when you're discussing a service issue on the phone, or downloading a software update. At such times, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information (for payment purposes) and information about the DynEd products you own, such as their registration numbers, and date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue.
When we disclose your information
DynEd takes your privacy very seriously. DynEd does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers or third parties. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with other entities within the global DynEd group who will also safeguard it in accordance with DynEd's privacy policy. We will disclose your information only if required by law.
