By signing a work order the Client gives CEI permission to connect to Client's vehicle through the OBD port and perform programming functions related to the vehicle transponder system. It may be necessary to access glove box, center console, or other parts of the interior during programming of keys/fobs. Although every effort is made to complete the programming and cutting phases in a short period of time, it may be necessary at times to allow CEI longer periods of time to successfully complete programming due to unforseen circumstances which may arise. If programming is not successful, Client will not be charged for services unless otherwise agreed to in advance. Keys requiring laser cuts will be charged at a higher rate.
