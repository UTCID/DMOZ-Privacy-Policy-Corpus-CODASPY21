Overview
The following are the terms of use between you and NortonLifeLock Inc. (“NortonLifeLock”, “Company”, “we” or “us”). The following terms and conditions, together with any policies incorporated by reference (collectively, these "Terms of Use"), govern your access to and use of www.NortonLifeLock.com, all its subdomains and all other websites or owned, operated or maintained by NortonLifeLock and its affiliated companies, including any content and functionality offered thereon (collectively, the "Website"). The term “you,” as used in this these Terms of Use, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the Website.
By accessing, or using this Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these terms and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this Website. NortonLifeLock may, without notice to you, at any time, revise these Terms of Use and any other information contained in this Website. NortonLifeLock may also make improvements or changes in the products, services, or other content displayed in this Website at any time without notice.
For the avoidance of doubt, your use of any products or services you have selected to receive from NortonLifeLock, including account information and account management; and all purchases through our Website or other transactions for the sale of products or services formed through the Website are governed by the applicable License and Services Agreement, Terms of Sale, and other applicable terms available at our Legal Repository. These Terms of Use are in addition to any such terms that may apply to you. Any conflicts between these Terms of Use and the License and Services Agreement or Terms of Sale shall be superseded and governed by the License and Services Agreement or Terms of Sale, or other applicable terms, respectively (and solely as applicable). Any claims and disputes arising under the License and Services Agreement or Terms of Sale shall be subject solely to those terms and not these Terms of Use.
Continuing Agreement
We may modify the Terms of Use from time to time. When changes are made, we will notify you by making the revised version available on this webpage, and we will indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last made. You should revisit these Terms of Use on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. To the fullest extent permitted under all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements (collectively, “Applicable Laws”), you understand and agree that your continued access to or use of the Website after any posted modification to the Terms of Use indicates your acceptance of the modifications.
