EMiR Modules and Extensions
EMiR, the market-leading integrated business management system, for the electro-mechanical industry.
EMiR Standard builds considerably on the 'Easy' functionality and allows the addition of unlimited users and many additional 'Modules' and 'Extensions' to help cover all your business operation in one integrated solution.
Our EMiR 'Professional' solution builds further on our 'Standard' solution and has enhanced functionality that is designed to suit larger organisations and particularly those with multi-site implementations [where a business has more than one site using the software on a Wide Area Network] in a client/server environment.
Whether you run a small business or a large corporate organisation you have to give consideration to your computer network.
Like all pieces of capital expenditure which depreciate over time, you have to maintain the asset, ensuring that it is fit for purpose and that takes skilled resource. You can, of course have the expense of replacing equipment on a regular basis to ensure that failures are minimised, or you have an alternative…
EMiR Modules are the core components of our EMiR Standard and Professional systems and plug together to deliver key business management capabilities. EMiR Extensions are designed to extend the core operation of EMiR into new and exciting areas via new channels such as tablet or Smartphone devices, or simply by extending the use of EMiR to other
parts of your organisation.

Project Management and Consultancy
Solutions in I.T. are here to help advise you and provide the best I.T. solution for your business. We usually only provide these services to our existing EMiR customers. View our services to see how we can help your business.
Your EMiR system will come with helpdesk and technical support free for 60 days and then via a recurring annual contract, to ensure you have help available if you need it and that your system is kept in fully working order.
EMiR Maintenance contracts come in 3 flavours: Bronze, Silver and Gold. They all provide excellent value for money and ensure you are able to add any of the newly developed features for EMiR to your system for a flat fee - so you never need to go through a formal 'upgrade' process again. Simply put, your system is always up-to-date with the best functionality EMiR has to offer!
DECiR is our five step proven process for successfully getting EMiR up and running in your business!
Remote Backup and Data Storage is a vital component of any IT system and we thoroughly recommend you use our EMiR Backup solution to keep all your data [not just EMiR data] safe and secure with minimal effort on your part!
Every EMiR installation has a project management plan and we can extend this to include any IT projects you wish to undertake.
On-site Training
Online Training
Solutions in I.T. offer training services to help you and your staff get up and running with EMiR.
Initial training on EMiR is provided on-site with the sale of our Standard or Professional systems. Additional on-site training can be designed and provided based on your needs and your staff requirements.
Online training is a very flexible and cost-effective alternative to on-site training and is ideal to train your staff directly at their own desks in a one-on-one session.
