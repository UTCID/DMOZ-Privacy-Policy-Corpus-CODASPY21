International Law and Cyberspace: It's the "How", Stupid
Dec 10, 2020 12:43 PM PST
The Internet has enhanced freedom of communication, ignored national borders, and removed time and space barriers. But the Internet sphere was never a law-free zone. Already ICANN's "Articles of Incorporation" (1998) constituted that the management of critical Internet resources has to take place within the frameworks of "applicable national and international law". more

Can We Advance Policies Towards a Safe Transnational Internet Market for Medicines?
Dec 09, 2020 12:13 PM PST
As 2020 draws to a close, it becomes possible to assess the trends from different policy areas that were most impacted by the global pandemic, with health-related policies rising to the top of that list. This article focuses on the sale of medicines using the Internet, as it should, without a doubt, be one of the leading concerns of both the general public and policymakers. There is a disconcerting lack of broader social debate around the subject, even though the need is so great. more

Internet Governance and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Part 6: Articles 18-19
Dec 01, 2020 11:39 AM PST
Internet Governance, like all governance, needs guiding principles from which policy making, and acceptable behavior, are derived. Identifying the fundamental principles to guide Internet ecosystem policy making around digital citizenship, and around the integrity of digital practices and behavior, can and should start with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, (UDHR). more

CIPA Supports Key Findings From Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies Survey
Nov 23, 2020 2:41 PM PST
The Canadian International Pharmacy Association (CIPA) has posted here previously about the realities of people using the Internet today to purchase prescription medications. We've written extensively about the importance of access to safe online pharmacy websites -- run by licensed, legitimate pharmacies -- dispensing legally manufactured maintenance drugs to individuals with valid prescriptions. more

A Winning Biden 5G Strategy: Flatten the Curve
Nov 23, 2020 2:28 PM PST
No, not the COVID curve - the curve of U.S. engagement in global industry 5G activities. Let me explain. What is known as 5G actually consists of a broad array of fundamentally revolutionary virtualization platforms that are constantly, collectively developed by industry in several dozen open global bodies. These bodies meet every few weeks, and several score companies around the world process scores to hundreds of input documents to produce many hundreds of effectively mandatory... more

What Does an Administration Change Mean for the FCC?
Nov 17, 2020 1:28 PM PST
Just as the last change in administration changed the course of the FCC, so will the swing back to a Democratic administration. If you've been reading me for a few years, you know I am a big believer in the regulatory pendulum. Inevitably, when a regulatory agency like the FCC swings too far in any direction, it's inevitable that it will eventually swing back the other way. more

Disinformation and Our Technology Industries
Nov 13, 2020 1:04 PM PST
It was interesting to see that, albeit belatedly, the American media started to stop giving Trump opportunities to spew out his lies across the country and beyond. It obviously had now reached a point where the media realized that if they continued to provide Trump with their avenues, this would make them accomplices in inciting violence. Is this going to be a turning point? more

Satellite and Space Debris Tracking as a Service
Nov 08, 2020 11:43 AM PST
On February 2, 1989, the Soviet Union launched its Cosmos 2004 satellite and the Chinese launched a rocket on December 15, 2009. Cosmos 2004 is now defunct, as is the third stage of that Chinese rocket, but both remain in orbit. They were long forgotten until recently when LeoLabs, a satellite tracking service, predicted that they had a good chance of colliding at 971 km over the sea near Antarctica. more

Another ICANN Meeting Concluded With No Action on DNS Abuse or Privacy/Proxy Policy
Nov 04, 2020 3:24 PM PST
The ICANN 69 meeting has come to a close, with no progress on DNS abuse or implementation of the Privacy/Proxy Services Accreditation policy (PPSAI). While ICANN is uniquely positioned to do so, it refuses to do anything proactive about DNS abuse, with its executives overtly attempting to limit its role to data collection. Moreover, its refusal to implement community-driven initiatives such as the PPSAI points to a growing trend where ICANN is backing away from its public interest responsibilities, to the detriment of the Internet and its users. more

The Upload Speed Lie
Nov 04, 2020 7:15 AM PST
In the 2020 Broadband Deployment Report, the FCC made the following claim. "The vast majority of Americans -- surpassing 85% -- now have access to fixed terrestrial broadband service at 250/25 Mbps". The FCC makes this claim based upon the data provided to it by the country's ISPs on Form 477. We know the data reported by the ISPs is badly flawed in the over-reporting of download speeds. Still, we've paid little attention to the second number. more

Every Internet Governance Stakeholder Has a Role to Play in the Online Health Debate
Oct 26, 2020 8:21 AM PST
Much has been discussed in relation to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on most aspects of human life, but the dialogue around the long-term repercussions of this event on health online has been rather limited. Telemedicine seems to be the most notable topic to have emerged, skyrocketing in interest in March, but in steady decline thereafter... perhaps because it is assumed that, soon enough, healthcare will simply revert to the way it was before. However... more

Going Postal
Oct 20, 2020 12:29 PM PST
When a service is constructed using diverse components, then the way in which service revenues are distributed to the various suppliers of the components of the service can follow a number of quite distinct models. There are various forms of revenue redistribution models where the revenue per transaction is distributed to the various suppliers according to their inputs to support each transaction. more

The Magnitude of the Urban Digital Divide
Oct 19, 2020 10:58 AM PST
The web is full of stories of rural areas with no broadband options, and I've spent a lot of time in the last few decades helping rural areas get better broadband. There has not been nearly as much coverage of the huge broadband gap in urban areas. There are a lot of urban homes that can't afford broadband and, in many cases, got bypassed when the telcos and/or cable companies built their networks. more

AI Initiatives at the US Post Office: Final Rethink Before We Dissolve It!
Oct 18, 2020 12:49 PM PST
MIT released a comical study in May of 2020 on the historical innovation accomplishments, and the potential logistical endeavors brought to light by the beleaguered United States Postal Service. The apparent scholarly article cited several technological implementations and employee empowered frameworks that could define the USPS's plight over the next five years. These frameworks, through FY2025, mention a postal-banking initiative and two AI autonomous vehicles initiatives. more
