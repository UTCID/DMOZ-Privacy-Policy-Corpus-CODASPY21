The Future of Interoperability
Integration
With more than 40 years of combined experience in healthcare technology, Lyniate brings together the expertise of Corepoint and Rhapsody, two industry-leading interoperability platforms. From integration engines on-premises, to cloud-based interoperability services, Lyniate is building on this foundation for today's integration challenges and readying our customers and partners for the future.
Innovation
From the earliest days of basic integration, through the development and growth of emerging standards across healthcare, Corepoint and Rhapsody have continued to build, evolve, and lead. Now under Lyniate, our Co-Creation Lab provides our customers, partners, and emerging vendors the platform and resources to co-develop the next generation of interoperability with us, meeting their needs and those of the evolving market.
Collaboration
Lyniate is built on the fundamental principle of collaboration, internally across our combined development teams, and externally through working with partners, vendors, and healthcare organizations that share the same belief in making a real difference to the quality of healthcare provided to millions of people every day.
Simplicity
Lyniate simplifies the complexities of healthcare interfacing by enabling data flow between various systems, giving your team the confidence that patient data will always be there when needed. Whether you’re migrating to a new EHR, undergoing a merger or acquisition, or connecting to new systems within your healthcare ecosystem — be it state or regional HIEs, payers, or other data-trading partners — Lyniate’s suite of products and services can help you keep patient data flowing where it should.
Speed
Lyniate's solutions allow your team to create connections in the shortest timeframe possible and include features and tools to expedite the delivery of our platforms so your organization realizes the return on its investments quickly, all while ensuring continuity of performance during migrations, conversions, and the creation of new interfaces. With health IT professionals working on multiple projects, building interfaces quickly frees up time for other critical activities.
Security
As the number of data trading partners and connections among networks increases, healthcare organizations must protect patient data at rest and in motion. Lyniate’s built-for-healthcare interoperability solutions were designed to move patient data securely. Our participation in industry connectathons also ensures our secure solutions work with products and services from other health IT vendors.
“(Rhapsody) met our needs without us having to invest in local infrastructure, on-premise resources, and did not slow us down.”
