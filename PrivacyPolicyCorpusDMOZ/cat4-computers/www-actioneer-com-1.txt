Your privacy is important to Actioneer. The information you enter into Actioneer products is not sent anywhere by those products but to the Web sites to which it is directed. Actioneer does not store any data about you other than the email address supplied by you when you register for support with Actioneer and a record of your email correspondence with us.  We cannot know where you go on the Web or elsewhere. We have no record of that information to divulge to any third party.
Actioneer does not place cookies on your computer.
If you send us your email address for any reason, we will not abuse your trust in us. We will send you email only to respond to requests for information, or to send you occasional notice of new Actions available or other Actioneer product information.
Your email address will not be communicated to any third party except in the event of the sale of the Actioneer business, when it would be included for continuity of the business relationship with you.
You can remove yourself from our mailing list at any time by emailing us a request to do so.
