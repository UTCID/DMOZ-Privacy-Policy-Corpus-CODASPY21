Powertech Cybersecurity Solutions by HelpSystems
Identity and Access Management
Secure your system by managing user privileges and access to sensitive data—without getting in the way of productivity. Security experts recommend following the rule of least privilege, which gives users access to only the data they have a demonstrable business purpose for accessing. Prove your systems are secure by maintaining a complete audit trail of powerful user activities. Learn more >
Virus Protection
No server is immune to viruses and malware. And in many cases, you won’t know if your system is infected unless you check it. The best way to prevent viruses and malware from spreading throughout your system and protect files with anti-virus software that runs natively on your IBM i, AIX, and Linux servers. Effective malware protection can help you avoid downtime and meet compliance requirements. Learn more >
Security and Integrity Monitoring
Monitor your system for unauthorized changes, so threats can be detected and removed before mission critical data is damaged or exposed. Security integrity monitoring typically involves getting visibility into who initiated a change, when the changed was made, and whether the change was authorized. If a breach occurs, the information provided by integrity monitoring allows you to accurately assess the scope of the breach. Learn more >
Encryption
Encrypt data at rest and in motion to ensure cyber attackers never gain access to your sensitive data or proprietary information. Data encryption is a critical layer of security that can greatly reduce the impact of a breach. For many organizations, file encryption isn’t just “nice to have”—it’s required by compliance mandates like PCI DSS and HIPAA. Learn more >
Security Policy Management
Make your cybersecurity controls more efficient and effective by implementing security policies that outline how your organization protects sensitive data. The purpose of a security policy is to provide greater control and visibility into systems settings and user activity, but that goal can only be achieved if your policies are up to date and you have a way to identify policy exceptions. Learn more >
Intrusion Prevention and Detection
Securing private information—while enabling authorized use for business purposes—is the goal of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS). Tools that guard sensitive data and provide visibility into suspicious activity on your systems allow for an accelerated threat response. Maintain an audit trail to prove to auditors that your organization has systems in place to prevent and detect intrusions. Learn more >
Vulnerability Assessment
Data protection starts with identifying and quantifying the security vulnerabilities on your system. Improving your security posture is simpler when vulnerabilities are prioritized and members of your organization are working toward a common goal. If your organization is required to comply with compliance mandates like HIPAA, SOX, or PCI DSS, a vulnerability assessment is more than a good first step—it’s a requirement. Learn more >
IBM i Security
IBM i is one of the most securable operating systems around, but default settings and misconfigurations put many servers at risk. This fact is confirmed year and year by the annual State of IBM i Security Study. A partner who knows IBM i inside and out can help you leverage the operating system’s powerful security features—and the security pros at HelpSystems have real-world IBM i experience that’s second to none. Learn more >
Cloud Security
Cloud security is a struggle for many organizations. The pace at which development teams spin up new cloud systems often makes it difficult to enforce best-practice security controls. And at some organizations, the cloud remains a dangerous security blind spot. Solutions that provide visibility and control across server on-premises and in the cloud give you the security and flexibility you need to today’s threat landscape. Learn more >
