O'Neil complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. O'Neil Software Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms of this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

O'Neil also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 which is a regulation in the European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU. It safeguards the export of personal data and is designed to give EU citizens control over their personal data being held outside the EU.

In the case of onward transfer to Third Parties, O'Neil may be liable if the data is misused unless we can prove we were not responsible for the event leading to the damage.

When you login into our platform, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
Processor on Behalf (oneilCloud)
O'Neil provides cloud based web services, which includes the storage of data, in an online repository known as the oneilCloud. These services are designed to help companies manage their off-site records stored at commercial record centers utilizing O'Neil software. O'Neil provides this cloud based service though its' customers comprising a large geographic coverage of more than 90 countries worldwide. We collect information under the direction of our clients, and we have no direct relationship with the data we process. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our clients that use our service, please contact the client that you interact with directly. O'Neil does not own or control any of the information stored or processed by any customer, including by or on behalf of any customer's client(s). Only our customers and their clients are entitled to process, store, access, and retrieve such information. O'Neil has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent to further contact should direct his/her query to the O'Neil Client (the data controller). If the Client requests O'Neil to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.
O'Neil will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. O'Neil will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Through careful analysis of specific business requirements, O'Neil's customers may recommend that their clients are better served by utilizing the oneilCloud web services. O'Neil customers recommending this service to their clients must clearly explain that the client(s) information that originates in the EU will be stored on Amazon servers located in the U.S., Australia, and Ireland, and which is accessible over the Internet only by our customer or our customer's client(s).
O'Neil does not own or otherwise disclose or make available to third parties the data that is stored through use of its oneilCloud web service by our customers or our customer's client(s), and such data is considered owned or controlled only by that customer's client(s) or our customer, including if acting on behalf of the customer or the customer's client. O'Neil does not actively process the data stored on its server under the oneilCloud web service. Furthermore, under no circumstances may O'Neil independently cause our customer's data or our customer's client(s) data to be transferred to any third party, such action being limited to either our customer or our customer's client(s). Also, O'Neil's standard operating policy in this case is not to directly cause a transfer of any such data other than to return it to the applicable customer. In this capacity, O'Neil should be considered only as a processor on behalf as to any personal data that may be considered transferred from the EU to the U.S. subject to the requirements of the Framework and or GDPR. As such, either our customer or, more particularly, our customer's client(s) is (are) the Data Controller as they or one of them have the actual control over the way any personal data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such data. O'Neil is not responsible for the content of the information stored on its server by our customers or our customer's client(s) nor is O'Neil responsible for the way our customers or our customer's client(s) treat such information.
Data Controller (oneilCloud)
The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles require that those who collect and determine the purposes and the means of the processing of personal data to fulfill very specific requirements related to compliance with the Framework. The specific functions of a Data Controller will depend on the specific laws of each EU member state. However, since O'Neil is not the collector or in control of any personal data, because it, neither alone nor jointly with others, will determine the purposes and means of collecting and the processing and uses of such data, it should not be considered as acting in the capacity of Data Controller with attendant responsibilities under the Privacy Shield Framework. Although O'Neil, without its actual knowledge, may be provided data or information subject to the Framework by customers by means other than use of the oneilCloud web services in order to aid in the resolution of a technical issue, it should not be considered a data collector or Data Controller as to such data. Furthermore, O'Neil strongly recommends that our customers and our customer's clients(s) do not include personal data in such transmittal to it, and it may reject and return such data to the sender if it becomes aware that such data is not in compliance with such requirement.
Web Services License Agreement (oneilCloud)
O'Neil and our customers enter into a contract with regards to the oneilCloud web service and this includes that each party understands its role in complying with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. Any data considered processed or stored by O'Neil on behalf of our customer or any customer's client(s) will not be further disclosed to third parties, except as directed or required by our customer or customer's client(s), each acting only in compliance with the Framework.
The contract with our customer also will specify that our customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining reasonable security measures relating to our customer or customer's client(s) access to the data stored within the O'Neil oneilCloud, including assignment and administration of all identification codes and passwords authorizing such access. Our customer or our customer's client(s), as applicable, is responsible for all security measures relating to such identification codes and passwords. O'Neil has in place commercially reasonable measures to protect data on its network from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration and destruction.
As merely a processor on behalf of our customer or our customer's client(s) (who is considered the EU Data Controller), O'Neil is not required to apply other EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to personal information subject to the Framework and considered received for processing (i.e., storage) from our customers or customer's client(s).
Notice (oneilCloud)
O'Neil requests that our customers comply with their respective obligations and our customers understand that O'Neil recommends that any data being managed under oneilCloud is non-confidential, nor do we recommend the use of our web services for the management of Personal Information.
Data Integrity (oneilCloud)
O'Neil is entirely dependent on our customer's contractual compliance in connection with any authorization for access to such customer's or customer's client(s) data in the oneilCloud as well as its nature and content. O'Neil has no requirement to access data located on its oneilCloud other than as expressly permitted or directed by our customers and, in no case, will O'Neil be involved in the further processing or manipulation of such data. O'Neil takes reasonable steps to assure that any data that is considered transferred from the EU to the U.S. is maintained in a reliable, accurate and complete state, subject always to any deficiencies in the state in which it was received that may have been caused by others.
Security (oneilCloud)
As noted above, the control of access to data stored on the oneilCloud web services is under the direct and primary control of and subject to the security measures undertaken by the O'Neil customer base. O'Neil has made provisions that all data "at rest" and stored in the oneilCloud system is encrypted to better assure the protection and confidentiality of such data. O'Neil has in place security procedures and commercially reasonable security measures to protect all information stored on the utilized servers from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
O'Neil's customers will be notified of any breach of the security measures implemented by O'Neil that O'Neil becomes aware of, and our customer is responsible for notifying our customer's customer(s) of such breach. Any measures or actions required to be undertaken by our customers or customer's client(s) in connection with such breach are solely the responsibility of our customers, as applicable. If O'Neil receives a request to download data stored in the oneilCloud by our customer onto archival media, O'Neil will do so only upon receipt of a written request and directions (including by email) therefore from the requesting customer, as applicable, and such media will be sent via a reliable carrier or courier, as authorized by the customer. Upon its delivery to such carrier or courier, O'Neil shall have no further obligation thereafter for the security or safety of the data included on such media.
