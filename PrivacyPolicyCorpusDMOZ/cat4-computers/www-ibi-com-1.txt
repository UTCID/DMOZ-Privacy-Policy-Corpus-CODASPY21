12. Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights
You and Information Builders agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and Information Builders hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Information Builders relating to these terms and conditions (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Information Builders will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR INFORMATION BUILDERS WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
13. Other Provisions
We may modify these terms and conditions at any time. By continuing to use or log in the Websites after these terms and conditions have changed, you indicate your agreement to the revised terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the changes, you should stop using or logging in the Websites.
Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these terms and conditions will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
We may assign our rights and obligations under these terms and conditions, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.
If any provision of these terms and conditions is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of the terms and conditions shall continue in full force and effect.
