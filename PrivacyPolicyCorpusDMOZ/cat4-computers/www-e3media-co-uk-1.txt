Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.Great State take a multi layered approach to protecting and securing access into our network and systems. This approach makes use of multiple best in class security services and components to protect our business systems and client data.The purpose of including multiple layers in your network security is to make sure that each single defence component has a backup in the case of a flaw or missing coverage. The individual strengths of each layer also cover any gaps that other defences may lack.Each individual layer in a multi-layered security approach focuses on a specific area where the malware could attack. By working in concert, these layers of security offer a better chance of stopping intruders from breaching company networks than using a single solution.The types of security layers we use in our network defence include, but are not limited to:Web ProtectionPatch Management (OS & 3rd Party Applications)Email Security and ArchivingEndpoint SecurityData EncryptionPerimeter & Endpoint FirewallsPerimeter & Endpoint Intrusion ProtectionDigital CertificatesRole Based Access Control (RBAC)Data Leak Protection (DLP)Application Control & Software RestrictionsDevice ControlAdvanced Threat Protection (ATP)We undertake several independent security assessments, run by National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) approved CHECK/CREST testers, and hold multiple security compliance accreditations, which not only verifies our security approach, but also demonstrates our dedication and commitment to protecting our business and client's data.These include:ISO 27001Cyber Essentials PlusRegular Vulnerability AssessmentsPenetration TestingFirewall Configuration Reviews7 How long will we keep your personal data for?We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “request erasure” below for further information.In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.8 What are your rights?Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure because of specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.Request restriction on processing your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.Request transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.Right to withdraw consent where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.You will ordinarily not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
