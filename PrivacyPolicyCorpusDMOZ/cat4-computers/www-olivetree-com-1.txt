How To Contact Us
Information We Obtain
We obtain personal information about customers through our Services, publicly and commercially available
sources, and from some third-party services (such as social media networks). The types of personal
information we may obtain include:
Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);
Username and password when you register through our Services;
Geolocation data;
Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” or “Contact Us” feature; and
Behavioral data such as website pages visited or time spent using our Services.
Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services
We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies
(including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar
technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services.
The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser
characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
information on actions taken on our Services, and dates and times you access or use our Services. In
connection with our mobile apps, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to
uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon”
also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies
and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these
automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other
content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website,
a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and
store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.
We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device
information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you
have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may
have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be
notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of
cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of
our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple
and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with us through our apps or
other app developers.
In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social
media network (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from
the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social
media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends
lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social
media network.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media
sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with
these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject
to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. Our Company is not responsible for those providers’
information practices.
How We Use the Information We Obtain
We may use the information collected from and about you to:
Provide our products and services;
Create and manage online accounts;
Send promotional materials, alerts regarding available offers and other communications, including
communications through the Services and outside of the Services, such as via email and through
third-party websites and apps;
Communicate about, and administer participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers,
surveys, contests and market research;
Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement
agencies;
Anonymize personal information to provide third parties with aggregated data reports showing
anonymized information and other non-personal information;
Supplement your personal information collected from you with additional information from publicly
and commercially available sources, and/or information from third-party services;
Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of
providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and
other operational/business purposes.
Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing, enhancing, analyzing and
improving our Services; managing our communications; performing data analytics; and performing
accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other
liabilities; and
Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual
obligations and our policies.
In addition, we and our third-party service providers may use information collected through automated
means including cookies, web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies for purposes
such as (1) customizing our users’ visits to and use of our Services, (2) delivering content (including
advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users use our Services, and
(3) managing our Services and other aspects of our business.
We may use third-party analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The
analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web
server logs and similar technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services. The information
collected through these means may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third
parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services. To learn more about how to
opt out of Google Analytics services, please visit the link below:
Google Analytics:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
We also may use your personal information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time
of collection.
Information We Share
We may share customer personal information with:
Service providers in the US and other jurisdictions who perform services on our behalf.
Our third party clients or business partners, such as publishers and social media networks, for
marketing purposes, such as targeted promotional emails.
In addition, when the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person,
we may share it with third parties.
We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process,
(2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure
is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an
investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to
transfer personal information we have about you in the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer
of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or
liquidation).
Your Choices
We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you, such as how
we communicate with you.
To update your preferences, ask us to remove your information from our marketing mailing lists or submit a
request, please contact us as outlined in the How To Contact Us Section below.
You also can unsubscribe from our marketing mailing lists by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails.
Accessing, Reviewing, Updating and Modifying Personal Information
You have the right to access, review, update, and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our
custody and control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updates to
and corrections of inaccuracies in your personal information by emailing or writing to us at the contact
information set out below. We may request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the
identity of the individual seeking access to his/her personal information records.
Notice to California Residents
If you are a California Resident, please review our California
Privacy Rights Page for information on your privacy rights and for the ability to opt-out of any
future sale of your data. Please note Olive Tree does not at this time sell any personal information.
How We Protect and Retain Personal Information
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information we
have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access,
disclosure or use.
We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of
the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of such
personal information.
We retain personal information for the period needed to fulfill the purposes for which the personal
information was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to
our record retention obligations.
Transfers of Information
The Services may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially
provided the information, including the United States. We may transfer the personal information we
collect about you to the United States and/or another country, which may not be deemed to have the same
data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When your personal
information is in such countries, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security
authorities in accordance with applicable law. If you are a user located outside the United States or the
country to which your information may be transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal
information processed in the United States and/or such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies
and other tracking technologies as described above. When we transfer your information, we will protect
that information as described in this Notice.
Links to Third-Party Sites, Apps and Services
For your convenience and information, our Services may provide links to third-party sites, apps and
services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with Olive Tree Bible Software. These companies
may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not
responsible for the privacy practices of any sites, apps, or services outside our Company.

CREDIT CARD PROTECTION POLICY
At Olive Tree, we want you to feel safe and secure when you provide us with your personal information
online. For this reason we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your credit card and other
sensitive information when you make product purchases or request technical assistance. The process of
encryption minimizes the possibility of unauthorized individuals from viewing your information as it is
securely transmitted over the Internet. Once received, your credit card information is not transmitted over
the Internet again.
However, even with such protection policies and safeguard procedures in place, there
is always the possibility of fraud occurring. If you believe unauthorized disclosure or use of your credit
information has occurred, please follow the reporting procedures defined by your credit card's issuing
bank and contact us immediately.
Most credit card companies cover all charges that result form unauthorized
use of your credit card or may limit your liability to $50.

representations, whether electronic, written or oral, regarding the subject matter of this EULA. Olive
Tree's failure at any time to require strict performance by you or any other licensees of any of the

judgment, that any provision of this EULA is invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, such provision
will be deleted and the remainder of the EULA will be enforced as nearly as possible in accordance with

terminate your use of the Product and destroy any installations of the Product on your devices and in
your possession. Your continued use of the Product following our posting of a change of terms notice or a
new end user licensing agreement on the Product will constitute your binding acceptance of the change.
