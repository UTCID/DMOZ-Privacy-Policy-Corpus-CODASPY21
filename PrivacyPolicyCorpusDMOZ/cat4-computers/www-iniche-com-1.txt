iNiche.com Privacy PolicyThe following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the InterNiche website and other online marketing initiatives.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to save any password entered so you don't have to re-enter it each time you revisit the same site areas. A cookie is a small piece of information that is written to and read from your hard drive by your browser at the request of our Web pages. Information stored in cookies is not accessible to Web pages from other websites. Cookies themselves cannot retrieve any information about you or your computer's configuration. Other than the small amount of disk space used to store a cookie, they are harmless.
Registration forms on the site may require you to give us contact information (such as name, mailing address and email address). We may use contact information from the registration forms to send you information about our company. Your contact information is also used to follow up with additional mail or email communication when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving any such future mailings.
This site contains links to other sites. InterNiche is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such linked websites.
InterNiche uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this statement. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. By using this site, you authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.
