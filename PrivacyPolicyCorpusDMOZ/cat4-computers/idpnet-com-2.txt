General
The Terms of Use and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via the Site or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between IDP and you with respect to your access to or use of the Site, Materials and Services superseding any prior agreements between you and IDP on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Use expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and IDP regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific terms of use and Software-specific licenses) (“Executed Agreement”), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other IDP services, third party content or third party software. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms of Use nor any right granted hereunder without IDP’s prior written consent. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by IDP to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
