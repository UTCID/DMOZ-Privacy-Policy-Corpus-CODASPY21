contact information.
Why we collect contact information
1099 Pro, Inc. collects and uses your contact information to give you superior customer
service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available
to you. In addition, we use your contact information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software
updates, IRS compliance regulations, special offers, and other information we think youâ€™d like to hear about. From
time to time, we may also use your contact information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so
that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.
How we collect contact information
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact
information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase, call for technical support, register to attend a
seminar, or participate in an online survey.
Additionally, when you shop at our website for Software, Service Bureau Filing Services, and
Forms, we collect information about your visit. We collect your IP address and we log the length of time of your visit
and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of
your future visits and purchases. We use this information to gather demographic information about our visitors, and we use
it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us
permission to send to you). We keep this information for our internal use only; we do not share it with others.
If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial
information (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address,
name, billing and shipping address) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact
information is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to
notify you of the status of your order. The financial information we collect is used ONLY to bill you for products you purchase.
