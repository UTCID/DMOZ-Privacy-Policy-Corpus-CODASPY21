c.	User Representations and Warranties. Each time you Submit User-Generated Material, you represent and warrant that you have the right to Submit the User-Generated Material, which means:
you are the owner of the User-Generated Material, or
the User-Generated Material is not protected by copyright law or any other laws or regulations that would prevent you from being able to Submit the User-Generated Material, or

You further represent and warrant that you have the right to grant Blick the license below, the User-Generated Material you Submit does not violate these Terms, and the User-Generated Material will not cause Blick to violate any law or regulation.
By providing User-Generated Material, you agree not to claim that any use of that User-Generated Material by us or any third party infringes or violates your or any other person’s intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, rights of publicity, or other right. You retain any copyright or other intellectual property right you may have in User-Generated Material that you provide, subject to the license granted to Blick below.
d.	User License Grant to Blick. If you Submit User-Generated Material, you hereby grant to Blick and its affiliates an unlimited, royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, assignable, sublicensable, non-exclusive right and license to copy, modify, adapt, reformat, translate, excerpt, display, archive, store, implement, publish, transmit, perform, reproduce, license, sell, exploit, create derivative works of, and otherwise use and distribute all such User-Generated Material you Submit, in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future, for any purpose, including without limitation developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and Services.

Submission of User-Generated Material may be subject to additional terms as may be provided at the point of upload or other Submission.
e.	Disclaimer of Responsibility for User-Generated Material.

Blick has no obligation to archive or otherwise store any User-Generated Material. Blick reserves the right to impose limits on features of the Services (e.g., the ability to provide User-Generated Material).
g.	Copyright Policy. We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we ask that our users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), located at 17 U.S.C. § 512, provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under US copyright law. If you believe in good faith that anything on the Services, including User-Generated Material and other content, infringes any copyright that you own or control, you (or your agent) may send Blick’s designated agent a notice that includes the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed; (b) a description of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed; (c) a description of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, including its location on the Services or information reasonably sufficient to allow Blick to locate the material within the Services; (d) your name, address, telephone number and email address; (e) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content or material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of, or are, the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services must be sent to Blick’s designated agent for claims of copyright infringement: Vice President of Marketing, Blick Art Materials, LLC, 695 Highway 150 E., Galesburg, IL 61401, Circulation@dickblick.com, 800-828-4548.
Blick suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA. We reserve the right to terminate any Services account of any user who is a copyright infringer.

27.	General
a.	Enforceability. If any portion of these Terms is found to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible. The remainder of these Terms shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to terms contained herein.
b.	Entire Agreement. Except as expressly provided in any notice or policy appearing on particular pages of the Services, these Terms, including our Privacy Policy and, as applicable, our Return Policy, our Gift Card Terms, the Blick Preferred Customers Terms & Conditions, any applicable artwork release forms, any rules and terms governing our Affiliate Program, and any Win With Blick giveaway rules, constitute the entire agreement between you and Blick with respect to your access to and use of the Services, superseding all prior agreements regarding the Services.
c.	No Waiver; Force Majeure. The failure of Blick to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of said right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Blick.
Blick shall not be deemed to be in default of any provision of these Terms or for failure in performance resulting from acts or events beyond the reasonable control of Blick and arising without its fault or negligence, including, but not limited to, acts of God, civil or military authority, interruption of electric or telecommunication services, civil disturbances, acts of war or terrorists, strikes, fires, floods or other catastrophes.
