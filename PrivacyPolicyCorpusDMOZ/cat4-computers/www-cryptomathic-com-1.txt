We will not collect Personal Information (as defined below) for purposes of sale or marketing in a way that identifies the individual; we do not sell customer lists.

Collection of Information
We aim to collect, store and use only such Personal Information as is required to enable us (i) to manage your account and communication preferences, i.e. to help us provide tailored and relevant communications for you, (ii) to provide any services to you or your organization, (iii) to maintain our customer and / or Website visitor lists, (iv) to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, (v) for identification and authentication purposes, and (vi) for service improvement. Cryptomathic only processes your Personal Information where we have lawful grounds and legitimate business reasons to do so. We will maintain the confidentiality of any Personal Information, including contact information, you provide to us and we will use such information only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures identified immediately below), unless you give your explicit consent to us that we may disclose such information to third parties.
Two types of information collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information
This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, storage, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a publicly available directory; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined below).
"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or access our Services. In other instances, your choice not to provide certain Personal Information may result in you not being able to use certain features of the Website or Services. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website or Services through registration; communications with you; information downloads; service use; purchases; user support; and surveys.
"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the Website or Services, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by users of the Website or Services. Aggregate information, such as number of visitors, pages accessed and average time spent on the Website constitutes Non-Personal Information, nor is general business contact information and information provided through your browser or stored in a cookie considered Personal Information.

We collect information for the following purposes:
1. Registration: In order to access our Services you must provide certain Personal Information.
2. Metadata: We collect and use various metadata derived from your use of the Website and Services. In cases where content is made publicly available such as public comments, the associated metadata may also be made publicly available.

Cookies help us compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Website, such as how many users visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often. This information is used to improve the content of the Website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the option to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the Website or Services.
7. Your IP address is reported by your web browser whenever you visit a page on the Website. This information is recorded together with your registration information in our databases.

Relationship with third Parties
We may employ third parties to help us improve the Website. These third parties may have limited access to the Personal Information solely for the purpose of improving the Website. They will be subject to contractual restrictions prohibiting them from using the Personal Information for any other purpose. Furthermore, if Cryptomathic becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and provide notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Security
The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use appropriate security measures to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment and protect against unauthorized access and disclosure.
Retention
We will keep your Personal Information only for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purposes, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you request that your Personal Information be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological constraints, however, in such circumstances we will refrain from contacting or actively using your Personal Information.
