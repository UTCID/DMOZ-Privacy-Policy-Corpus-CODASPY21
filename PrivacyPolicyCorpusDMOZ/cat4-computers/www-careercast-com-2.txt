We operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment, real estate and motors software customers. Our hosted software customers fill the role of data controller. Individual users involved in recruitment, real estate or motors activities usually interact directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees, candidates, agents, brokers, buyers, sellers and dealers of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that they use.

1. Notice/Use of Information
Because it supplies a hosted system, Adicio, Inc. operates as a data processor for our software customers. Our hosted software customers fill the role of data collector.

3. Onward Transfer
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include customer service; information processing, and data storage.
