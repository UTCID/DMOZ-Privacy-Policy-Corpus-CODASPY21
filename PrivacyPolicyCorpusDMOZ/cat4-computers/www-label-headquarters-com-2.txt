Privacy and Security Policy
Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy and security is important to us. To better protect your privacy and security we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
The Information We Collect
We collect no information on visitors who browse our Web pages. We do collect name and address, phone number and payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address) for customers that register on our site and/or place an order. On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address.
The Way We Use the Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete and ship that order.
We use your email address to contact you regarding your order, to reply to email we receive and send you our newsletter. If you do not want to receive email newsletters from us in the future, please let us know by contacting us at the email address below.
The information we collect is disclosed when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website.
Our Commitment to Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
We use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart. Items will not show up in your shopping cart if cookies are not enabled.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information (e.g., customer number or password), transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases), and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain by logging into your account on the website. You can make changes to your personal information when you are logged into your account.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
How To Contact Us
This is the web site of RDS Services, Inc. Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy and security policies, we can be reached via email at mailto:support@label-headquarters.com
