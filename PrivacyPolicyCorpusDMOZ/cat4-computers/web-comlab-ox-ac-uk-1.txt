Privacy policy
Personal Information
On some parts of this site, you may be asked to provide some limited personal
information in order to enable the provision of certain services.
By supplying this information you are consenting to the University holding
and using it for the purposes for which it was provided.
Information provided by you will be kept for as long as is necessary to
fulfil that purpose. Personal information collected and/or processed by the
University is held in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and related UK data protection legislation.
Personal information will not be sold or given to third parties, or provided to direct
marketing companies or other such organisations without your permission.
However, if we are under a duty to disclose or share such information in order to comply with any legal obligation
or to protect the rights, property or safety of the University, its members or others we may disclose your personal information to third parties.
Website Cookies
When you visit some pages on this site, your web browser may be issued
with a small piece of text (a "cookie") by this site ("1st party") or other sites ("3rd party'). Your web browser may communicate that cookie back to the originating site in
subsequent visits.
Some cookies will be temporary and will be destroyed when the web browser is closed ("session cookies"), other
cookies will remain until they expire or are removed ("persistent cookies").
It is very likely that there are some options in your web browser preferences that can show you all the cookies being stored, and lets you delete or block them if you wish.
Cookies may be:
fundamentally necessary for the delivery of the web service you are using ("strictly necessary"), e.g. enable tracking of items in an online shopping basket or to enable session tracking for a service
that you log in to,
necessary to benefit from the full functionality of the service, but not essential for some level of service ("functional"), e.g. user preferences and options, often default user preference cookies are issued if they are not present,
for the benefit of the service provider or, to allow the service provider to better understand its users and therefore provide a better service for them, albeit indirectly, based on aggregate data ("performance"),
e.g. analytical tools so a site can produce statistics on the types of users it has or the sections of its site that are most or least popular or interesting,
but could equally be for a wide range of other purposes.
Below is a table listing the cookies that may be set / issued when visiting this site. (Cookies being issued that are part of services that are only accessible internally
– those services accessible on an intranet that resides within the University of Oxford as an organisation but not outside – are not included).
