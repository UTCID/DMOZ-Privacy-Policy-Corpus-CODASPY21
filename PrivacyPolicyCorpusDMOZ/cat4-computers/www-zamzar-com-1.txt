We limit our use of your personal information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. If we need to use your personal information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.

1.2 Information We Do Not Collect
We do not intentionally collect or store special categories of personal data, such as genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Zamzar does not request or intentionally collect any special categories of personal data, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, via the files that you convert.
If you ask us to convert or store any files containing special categories of personal data on our servers, located in the United States, we will only do so on your instructions as a data processor and in accordance with our Data Processing Agreement with you. You are the controller of this data and you must ensure that you have a legal basis to share this data with us.
1.3 How We Use Your Information and our Legal Basis for doing so
We use the information you provide to us in a number of ways and we have set out our legal basis for processing your information below:
To provide, update and maintain the Services we offer to you
This is the most common usage of your information. We use your personal information to provide various file conversion Services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. In particular, we will use your data to: set-up an account; convert the files that you provide us with into different formats; and if you provide us with an email address, send you links to download those files to that email address.
Our use of your personal information in this way is necessary to perform our obligations to provide the Services to you, under our Terms of Service.
To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions
If you contact our support team we may use the information that you provide to us in order to help us respond to your enquiry.
Our use of your personal information in this way is necessary to perform our customer service obligations to you, under our Terms of Service.
If we do not have a contract with you, we may process your personal information for these purposes where it is in our legitimate interests to do so for customer services purposes.
For billing, account management and other administrative matters
Zamzar may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.
Our use of your personal information in this way is necessary to perform our obligations to you under our Terms of Service.
As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation
We may use your information to comply with court orders and similar legal or regulatory obligations which apply to us.
This may include where we reasonably consider it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others to comply, as well as where we are legally required to do so.
To investigate and help prevent abuse or security issues
We may use information such as your IP address to help us prevent abuse of the Services we provide and investigate any potential unauthorized use of those Services or other security breaches.
In these circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data, and do not believe that this storage and use of your data will be of particular concern to you.
If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at section 5.5.
We also collect and use data which is aggregated or anonymised for certain business purposes, such as creating aggregate statistics or reporting. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.

2. How We Share Data
2.1 Sharing Your Information
We do not share, sell, rent or trade your email address with any third parties for any commercial purposes.
We may share personal information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Services, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy.
We will share your personal information with the following third party vendors:
Amazon Web Services, Inc who provides server hosting and content distribution networks (CDN's) services;
MacStadium, Inc and Keyweb AG who provides server hosting services;

When we transfer your data to our vendors, we remain responsible for it. We try to ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us.
We may share personal information where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of personal information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your personal information.
2.2 Third Party Advertising
We do not host any third party advertising at zamzar.com.
2.3 Legal Disclosures
Zamzar may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. This may include exchanging personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We will also disclose your personal information to third parties in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity.
3. How We Manage Data
3.1 Security
Zamzar takes the security of data very seriously, and we work hard to protect any information you provide to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including through use of appropriate organisational and technical measures. These measures take into account the sensitivity of the data we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology.
Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, Zamzar cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, but we do our utmost to protect it. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it.
As a minimum we take the following measures to secure your data:
Physical Security - Zamzar infrastructure is only hosted in data centres which meet rigorous security standards. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilising video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.
Data Transfer Integrity - All traffic to and from Zamzar servers is secured by transport level security (TLS) sent over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and secured using an AES 256-bit SSL certificate. This ensures that data sent between your systems and ours is encrypted using military grade encryption.
Password Encryption - Zamzar user account passwords are stored in our database after being salted and hashed using the Bcrypt encryption algorithm.
Firewalls - Zamzar enforces network level control for access to infrastructure by using multiple different firewall technologies to ensure that different components of its systems are logically isolated from one another.
Operational Access Controls - Zamzar employees require access to production services for operational reasons. We employ multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure that production systems are accessed only by authorised members of staff and are protected from unauthorised access.
Software Updates - Zamzar regularly applies software patches to production infrastructure in order to ensure a strong security posture to known software vulnerabilities.
External Accreditation - Zamzar takes a pro-active approach to security by employing an external company to perform monthly security scans of its infrastructure.
Bug Bounty Program - Zamzar operates an informal "bug bounty" program that encourages security researchers to perform limited and authorised testing of the integrity of Zamzar systems.
3.2 Data Retention and Deletion
If you have an account with Zamzar
If you have an account with Zamzar, we will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Services that you request (in accordance with our Terms of Service).
Once your account is deactivated we will permanently remove any files associated with your account 35 days after deactivation.
We may retain certain other personal information (such as your email address) for 18 months after your account is deactivated, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don't automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you ask us to permanently delete your account we will retain some account information to enable you to return and use our Services more easily in future.
If you do not have an account with Zamzar
We will store any files you submit to us for conversion, and their converted outputs on our systems for no longer than 7 days following receipt. After this time they are permanently removed from our storage systems.
We will retain personal information such as your IP address, email address (if provided by you) and browser details for no longer than 30 days. After this time we permanently delete your browser data and anonymise your IP address and email address (if provided by you) so that we can no longer personally identify you.
3.3 International Data Transfers
Zamzar may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you live, including to our file server suppliers located in the United States.
If we provide any personal information about you to any such non-EEA entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this privacy policy. These measures may include the following permitted in Articles 45 and 46 of the GDPR:
in the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield (see further https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome); or
in the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.
Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases is available from us on request by contacting us by email at info@zamzar.com at any time.
4. Your Rights

Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area and Switzerland, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances. We describe these rights below.
Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. Additionally your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
4.1 Right to be Informed
You have the right to be provided with information about the data we hold, our data processing activities and whether we transfer personal data outside of the EAA, along with the methods we use to safeguard such data.
4.2 Right to Access
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us.
4.3 Right to Rectification
You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate, out of date or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within the Services).
4.4 Right to Erasure
We generally retain any personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Services to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and (if you have one) close your user account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
Because we maintain the Zamzar Services to protect from accidental or malicious data loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
4.5 Right to Object / Restrict Processing
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request Zamzar not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on our (or another party's) legitimate interests. If you object to such processing Zamzar will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
4.6 Right to Data Portability
You may be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). This right only applies where we use your personal information on the basis of your consent or performance of a contract; and where our use of your information is carried out by automated means.
4.7 Lodging Complaints
Subject to applicable law, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is Zamzar's lead supervisory authority in the European Union.
