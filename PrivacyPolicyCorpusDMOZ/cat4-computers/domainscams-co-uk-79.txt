Information for Customers of Laser Electrical Limited – 02/04/2010
Information for consumers
Step 1 – How to make a claim
Anyone waiting for delivery of goods they’ve paid for must contact the Joint Administrators, preferably in writing to:
The Joint Administrators of Laser Electrical Limited,KPMG,Stokes House17-25 College Square EastBelfastBT1 6DH
The Consumer Council has sample claim letters explaining what information you need to include, which are available to download from the Sample Complaints Letters section of this website. You will also need to send photocopies of all receipts – do not send original documentation!
Urgent messages can be left on 028 9089 3742 or you can send an e-mail: laser@kpmg.ie.  Mark all e-mails for the attention of the Joint Administrators of Laser Electrical Limited.
Step 2 – Know your rights
Your rights differ depending on how you have paid for the goods i.e. credit card, debit card, cheque or cash.
Credit card – you have added protection from your credit card provider if your purchase was over £100. You should contact your provider directly.  A template letter can be downloaded here.
Debit Card – Visa debit cards offer a ‘Chargeback’ facility which enables your bank to claim money back for you in cases where goods fail to arrive, the company goes bust, or the goods are faulty or misdescribed.
Non-Visa debit cards/Cash/Cheque – you need to write to the joint administrator, KPMG and send them photocopies of all receipts. A template letter can be downloaded here.
Paid by credit agreement – If the shop arranged the credit agreement for goods costing between £100 to £30,000 and it goes bust before you take delivery, you may have rights against the finance company that the credit agreement is with.
Remember,if you have received your goods +and the business goes bust you must still pay the finance company the full amount for your goods under the terms of your credit agreement.

Domain Name Facts - know the facts, avoid being scammed
International & UK domains are registered instantly - no other company is informed of the registration and no-one can intervene
International (.com .net .org) domains can be registered for 1 - 10 years, whereas UK (.co.uk .org.uk .ltd.uk .plc.uk .me.uk) domains are registered and renewed at 2 year intervals - it is not possible to register a UK domain for anything more or less than 2 years
Domain names can be registered cheaply, quickly and easily online, you do not necessarily need an agent to register for you
Companies that sell domain names by telesales are almost always scammers
A registration company is not obliged to check trademarks and company names before agreeing to register any domain - this is the registrant's responsibility
Owning a trademark or company name does not automatically entitle you to the matching domain names
It is not possible to "earmark" or reserve a domain name
DON'T send money to companies you've never heard of
