Except for certain information that is required by law or by Avanade policies, your decision to provide any personal data to us is voluntary.

The above-mentioned categories of personal data have been obtained either directly from you (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website) or indirectly from certain third parties (for example, through our website’s technology). Such third parties include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers and vendors.
For which purposes and on which legal basis do we use your personal data?

Where the above table states that we rely on our legitimate interests for a given purpose, we are of the opinion that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms, given (i) the transparency we provide on the processing activity, (ii) our privacy by design approach, (iii) our regular privacy reviews and (iv) the rights you have in relation to the processing activity. If you wish to obtain further information on this balancing test approach, please contact Avanade’s Data Privacy Officer at AvanadeDPO@avanade.com.
We will process your personal data for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.
To the extent you are asked to click on/check “I accept”, “I agree” or similar buttons / checkboxes / functionalities in relation to a privacy statement, doing so will be considered as providing your consent to process your personal data, only in the countries where such consent is required by mandatory law. In all other countries, such action will be considered as a mere acknowledgement and the legal basis of the processing of your personal data will not be your consent but any other applicable legal basis.
We will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes of which you have been informed, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.
Will we share your personal data with third parties?
We may transfer personal data to our service providers, professional advisors, public and governmental authorities, Accenture PLC and/or its affiliates or third parties in connection with Avanade’s operation of its business, including any (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Avanade’s internal policies.
Unless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal data from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below) . Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal data will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.
What about sensitive data?
We do not generally seek to collect sensitive data (also known as special categories) through this site or otherwise. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.
The term "sensitive data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you. These categories include racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, biometric or genetic data, sexual life or orientation, or criminal convictions and offences (including information about suspected criminal activities).
What about data security?
We maintain organizational, physical and technical security arrangements for all the personal data we hold. We have protocols, controls and relevant policies, procedures and guidance to maintain these arrangements taking into account the risks associated with the categories of personal data and the processing we undertake.
We adopt market leading security measures to protect your personal data. This includes (without being limitative):
Avanade’s Information Security Program aligns with the ISO 27001 framework.
We also hold an ISO 27001 certification for our Corporate Client Data Protection program and the CMS (Cloud Managed Services) business unit which indicates that we adhere to the highest and strictest information security standards. This certification is an international security standard that is awarded and confirms that Avanade’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and Avanade’s information.
We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.
We have regular penetration testing performed by a third-party provider, which continues to show the strength of our technical defenses.
Where will your personal data be processed?
As a global organization with offices and operations globally, personal data we collect may be transferred or be accessible internationally throughout Avanade's global business and between Avanade’s entities and/or its affiliates, including Accenture PLC and/or its affiliates.
Any such transfers throughout Avanade’s global business take place in accordance with applicable data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation) and governed by the Avanade Intra-Group Data Protection Agreement (IGDPA) and the Intra-Group Data Processing and Transfer Agreement (IGDTA).
Having our Intra-Group Data Protection Agreement (IGDPA) and Intra-Group Data Processing and Transfer Agreement (IGDTA) means that all our group entities which have signed up to these Agreement have to comply with the same internal rules. It also means that your rights (see “Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?”) stay the same no matter where your data are processed by Avanade.
How long will your personal data be retained by us?
We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary. We maintain specific records management and retention policies and procedures, so that personal data are deleted after a reasonable time according to the following retention criteria:
We retain your data as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you (in particular, if you have an account with us).
We will only keep the data while your account is active or for as long as needed to provide services to you.
We retain your data for as long as needed in order to comply with our global legal and contractual obligations.
Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?
You are entitled (in the circumstances and under the conditions, and subject to the exceptions, set out in applicable law) to:
Request access to the personal data we process about you:
this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal data about you, and if we do, to obtain information and a copy of that personal data.

To the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting Avanade’s Data Privacy Officer. Please note that this will not affect Avanade’s right to process personal data obtained prior to the withdrawal of your consent, or its right to continue parts of the processing based on other legal bases than your consent.
If, despite our commitment and efforts to protect your personal data, you believe that your data privacy rights have been violated, we encourage and welcome individuals to come to Avanade first to seek resolution of any complaint. You have the right at all times to register a complaint directly with the relevant supervisory authority or to make a claim against Avanade with a competent court (either in the country where you live, the country where you work or the country where you deem that data privacy law has been infringed).
