cookies.” They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain
in your device’s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to
recognize your browser when you next visit the site.
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use
of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or
reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically

5. Analytics and advertising
Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics
service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
View, CA 94043, USA.
Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text
files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of
the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of
this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored
there.
Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1)
(f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user
behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.
IP anonymization
We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this
website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union
or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to
transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP
address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use
this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use
of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other
services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator.
The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not
be merged with any other data held by Google.
Browser plugin
You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting
the appropriate settings in your browser.  You can also prevent the data
generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from
being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by
downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
Objecting to the collection of data
You can prevent the collection of your data by Google
Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to
prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: Disable
Google Analytics.
For more information about how Google Analytics handles
user data, see Google’s privacy policy:
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.
Outsourced data processing
We have entered into an agreement with Google for the
outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements
of the European data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.
Demographic data collection by Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics’ demographic features.
This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender,
and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising
from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be
attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at
any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid
the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section
“Refusal of data collection”.
Google Analytics Remarketing
Our websites use the features of Google Analytics
Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and
DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway,
Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
This feature makes it possible to link target audiences
for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the
cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows
advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based
on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile
phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).
Once you have given your consent, Google will associate
your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose.
That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same
personalized promotional messaging.
To support this feature, Google Analytics collects
Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google
Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.
You can permanently opt out of cross-device
remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google
Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
For more information and the Google Privacy Policy, go to:
https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.
Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online
advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View,
CA 94043, United States (“Google”).
As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion
tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie
is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your
computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal
identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website
and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the
user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.
Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie.
Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The
information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion
statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were
redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain
any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not
want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the
Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing
so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f)
DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior
to optimize both its website and its advertising.
For more information about Google AdWords and Google
Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy:
https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.
You can configure your browser to inform you about the use
of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or
reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically
accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to
automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may
limit the functionality of this website.
Facebook Pixel
Our website measures conversions using visitor action
pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA
94304, USA (“Facebook”).
These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked
after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider’s website. This allows
an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and
market research purposes and their future optimization.
The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this
website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users’
identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may
make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its
own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This
will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We
have no control over how this data is used.
Check out Facebook’s privacy policy to learn more about
protecting your privacy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.
You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing
feature in the Ads Settings section at
https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen. You
will first need to log into Facebook.
6. Plugins and tools
YouTube
Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated
by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno,
CA 94066, USA.
If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin,
a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is
informed about which of our pages you have visited.
If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube
allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal
profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This
constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
Further information about handling user data, can be found
in the data protection declaration of YouTube under
https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
Google Web Fonts
For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web
fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required
web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct
connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was
accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the
interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This
constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard
font is used by your computer.
Further information about handling user data, can be found
at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google’s privacy policy at
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
