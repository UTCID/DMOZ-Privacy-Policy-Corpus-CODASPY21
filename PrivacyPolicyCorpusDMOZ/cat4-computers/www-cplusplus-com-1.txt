on that issue and informs you how we use personal information collected on this site.
Personal information

no personal information is required to access them.
Nevertheless, some services that allow users to participate actively by submitting content require
the user to be registered. All registered users need to provide at least the following
information:
Login name: Your login name is public and will be associated with any
content you submit. It serves to identify you as the author and will appear alongside it.
Email address: Your email address is needed for identification purposes.
It is only public if you choose so (by default it is not).
Password: We don't store your password, only a one-way hash value of it.
These fields are kept in our database for identification purposes, and are only used for
the services provided in this website and those you opt-in voluntarily.
Registered users have the option to fill a Personal profile with some additional
personal information which can be partly or entirely made public.
