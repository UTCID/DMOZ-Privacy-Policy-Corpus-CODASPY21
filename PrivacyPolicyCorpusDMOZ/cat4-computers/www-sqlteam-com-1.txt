Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice
explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your
information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on
our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
SQLTeam.com website. On some pages you are able to enter personal information and post content
on the site. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Email Address
Name
Country
Etc.
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if
you email an article to another individual we will ask for their email address. In this circumstance, the types

The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when registering in the
forums to complete that registration. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the
extent necessary to complete
the registration.
We use the information you provide about someone else when forwarding content
only to forward the content. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent
necessary to complete
that process.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other
purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.
For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or
that Y number of programmers and Z number of DBAs filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose
anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated
to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such
unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information,
we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect
or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website
is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by
updating your profile in the forums. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that
credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
granting access or making corrections.
