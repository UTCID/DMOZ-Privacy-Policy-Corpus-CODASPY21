Website Privacy Policy #
The Webarchitects Co-operative website privacy policy.
Our Privacy Notice contains information regarding our General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) compliance.
This site does not set cookies apart from the optional tracking opt out cookie.
This site is set to collect web usage statistics via our private Matamo servers and in addition via Apache web server log files, the Apache log files are kept for 28 days and are only automatically analysed for aggregrated site bandwidth usage.
Opt Out #
You may opt out of the Matamo stats, the best way to do this is to set the Do Not Track header in your web browser preferences, another way to opt out is to use a web browser plugin which stops web site usage tracking bugs, see some plugin suggestions on our wiki.
If you are unable to do set a Do Not Track header or install a privacy protecting blocker for your web browser then another method to prevent Matamo tracking your usage of this website is to set a opt out cookie, see the sentence below (if you don't see a sentence below then your web broswer hasn't loaded the iframe from the Matamo server, in that case you may access the opt out page directly).
