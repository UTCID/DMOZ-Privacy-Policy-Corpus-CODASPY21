All returns to Elara Online require the completion of a RMA request form from your [account menu] or by filling out the RMA request form from your [account menu] and emailing it to us. You will be advised as to whether your return has been authorised or denied, and given further instructions on returning the product. In some cases the customer will be required to contact the manufacturer directly to authorise a return. Elara will advise customers in the event of such cases. RMA processing generally take between 1-4 business days depending on the manufacturer but can take longer for certain products.
Returning a product
1. Log into your account and click on "my account" on the top right of the page to enter your account menu.
2. Under Account Options click on "return a product".
3. Select the order that contains the product you wish to return by clicking on "details/return".
4. Select the product you wish to return by clicking on "return this product" beside the product description.
5. Fill in the Returns form and click on submit.
Please note any items returned incorrectly as faulty or faulty due to user physical damage under dead on arrival or warranty terms will incur a €20 ex vat charge excluding all delivery cost. Please contact us on 01-6251320 if you are unsure if your item is faulty.
If a product is faulty on receipt (Dead on Arrival) they are generally replaced with a new unit rather than repaired. There are certain exceptions to this rule.
Products that develop a fault after use are generally repaired rather than replaced. Some manufacturers require that the end user contact them directly regarding faulty products and not the retailer. In such cases please contact Elara and we will be happy to supply you with the manufacturer's contact details. Please note that your statutory rights are not affected, if you are having problems contacting/dealing with the manufacturer, we will be happy to assist you. The quickest route is usually always for customers to contact the manufacturer directly. There are some items that require troubleshooting at the source; an example is a router with connected to an internet connection. Elara Online will not be able to do this for you.
Consumers with unwanted or unsuitable products must submit a return within 14 days and goods returned to Elara within 30 Days, starting the day after receipt of goods, in line with the "EU Directive" as long as the goods are in a resalable condition and include all packaging and accesories. Items should be tested without removing plastic protectors, unnecessarily opening accessories, installing permanent stands and any other action that will prevent the product from being resold as new. Doing so will incur a restocking fee or in some cases be rejected.
In such cases standard RMA procedures still apply. Goods must be returned at your own expense. Please note that this option is only available for home users, not business users.
You do not have a right of cancellation pursuant to clause 9 of our Terms and Conditions if:
the relevant Products were made to your specifications or were clearly personalised or, by reason of their nature, cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly;
the relevant Products are audio or video recordings, computer software or any other intangible digital product and were unsealed by you;
you are contracting or making an order for or on behalf of a business, company or other commercial entity.
If your goods were damaged in transit, we request that you report it to us within 48 hours. If goods are visibly damaged on receipt, please sign the delivery note accordingly.
Once the damaged goods are received back into our warehouse, we will send out a replacement for the item.
Incorrect product
If you have received the incorrect product, we request that you report it to us within 48 hours. Please do not open the incorrect product.
Missing items
If you missing items in your delivery which are not backordered, we request that you report it to us within 48 hours.
LCD displays are made up of a set number of pixels and each pixel is made from 3 sub pixels; one Red, one Blue and one Green. Every sub-pixel is addressed by its own transistor and so the manufacture of a glass substrate is very complex. Due to the nature of the manufacturing process, occasional defects can occur. Pixel defects or failures cannot be fixed or repaired and can happen at any stage in the LCD's life. To regulate the acceptability of defects and to protect the end user, ISO have created a standard for manufacturers to follow. ISO 13406-2 recommends how many defaults are acceptable in a display before it should be replaced, within the terms & conditions of warranty. All reputable manufacturers conform to and support the ISO 13406-2 standard.
The table below shows the allowable number of malfunctioning pixels that are acceptable, depending on the native resolution of the LCD and allowing for 2 malfunctioning pixels per million pixels.
Native resolution	No. of pixels	No. of million pixels	Acceptable defects
1024 x 768	786,432	0.8	2
1280 x 1024	1,310,720	1.3	3
1600 x 1200	1,920,200	1.9	4
2048 x 1536	3,145,728	3.1	6
The table below shows the allowable number of malfunctioning sub-pixels that are acceptable, depending on the native resolution of the LCD and allowing for 5 malfunctioning sub-pixels per million pixels.
Native resolution	No. of pixels	No. of million pixels	Acceptable defects
