2. Public Forums. Please note that your user name will be available to the Internet's general public while you participate in some Services, such as publishing products or posting on our message boards, so you should exercise discretion when using these Services. Personal information disclosed by you within our message boards, or similar Services can be collected by other users of such Services and may result in unsolicited messages.
