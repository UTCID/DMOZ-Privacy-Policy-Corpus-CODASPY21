At ChordPickout.com (“ChordPickout.com,” “we” or “us”) we respect your privacy rights and are committed to protecting the information we collect from you online. To further this commitment, we have developed the following Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) which explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information you provide to us on any of the websites covered by this Privacy Policy, which include the ChordPickout.com’s home page located at www.ChordPickout.com and every web site that links directly from the home page (second-level web sites), unless the site is not on a ChordPickout.com’s server or the site is licensed from a vendor (each a “Website,” and together the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy also covers the ChordPickout.com desktop applications, mobile applications, and is applicable worldwide.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through a Website or through our mobile or desktop applications.

This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. We have organized this Privacy Policy by major processes and areas so that you can quickly review the information of most interest to you. The bottom line is that meeting your needs and expectations forms the foundation of everything we do - including protecting your privacy.
This policy outlines our handling practices and how we collect and use the Personal Data you provide during your online and offline interactions with us.

You should direct any concerns regarding any external link to the site administrator or webmaster of such site.
Legal Issues
This Website may be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions, including the laws of the United States of America, Russian Federation and European Union and other jurisdiction because the access to our Website may use internet traffic of different jurisdictions, including without limitation the United States of America and European Union. ChordPickout.com will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to ChordPickout.com guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this Website), or to others.

B.     COLLECTED INFORMATION
As a visitor to the Website, we may collect both personal and non-personal information about you. Non-personal information includes anonymous information such as demographic data. Under all circumstances, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. Below for your review is a short description of the information that we may collect from you:
· Personal Information is information that can be used to identify you such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address. We do not collect any Personal Information about you unless you choose to provide it to us by, for example, filling out and submitting an online form. If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may be unable to use certain features on our Websites.
· Demographic information is anonymous information such as your age, date of birth, gender, hobbies, interests, zip/postal code or country. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires Personal Information, we may combine the demographic information with your Personal Information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your interests and preferences. Demographic information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user. If you choose not to provide certain demographic information, you may not be able to use certain features on our Websites.
· Aggregate information is anonymous data about individuals that is grouped together to study a group or category of services or users. Aggregate information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user.
C.     COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We request Personal Information and demographic information to respond to your requests and provide services to you such as: sending email newsletters; displaying targeted advertising (for example, in Facebook); participating in online; processing orders through our online store; setting up repair orders; and sending email correspondence. Each category below describes how we handle the requested information.
Browsing the Website
When you use the Website, we or third parties, authorized by us, may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and our services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to us every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on, the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by us and used to help improve our offerings to you.

All financial information is transmitted through the use of encryption, i.e. a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol via our secure server.
Email Correspondence and Other Communication
We may respond to your email correspondence and communications if such correspondence includes a return email address. Because an email address is Personal Information, we protect the privacy of the sender by limiting access to these email messages. Only employees with a legitimate business need to access the emails are allowed to do so. For quality control purposes, email messages may be kept for a period of time. There may, however, be certain cases where hard copies may be kept on file, such as emails concerning product safety or consumer complaints. Information from email messages will not be used for marketing purposes and will be maintained in a secure location.
Online Interaction
Our Website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or newsgroups (“Public Forums”) available to users.
