More on privacy at TomTom
Privacy-first, since the first dayTomTom was GDPR compliant long before GDPR existed. As an independent company powered by data, we’re committed to creating great products and a better future – without compromising your personal data.Protecting your identityWe use aggregated location data, protecting your personal infoWe never sell your dataYour data is used to improve our tech, and nothing elseControl is yoursYour data, your choiceNo adsThere to guide you, not to sell you things or distract you on the roadHow do we handle data?Responsibly. We go beyond the mere legal and compliance issues to ensure your identity is protected. This way you can feel good about using TomTom products, and we can feel good about using data.The virtuous circle of community dataWhenever you share real-time location data with us, you contribute to a continuous feedback loop that we use to improve our technologies. By contributing to our growing community, you therefore help everyone drive safer and more comfortably. You also get the best experience: Accurate maps, up-to-date traffic information and hazard warnings and new map features.Safeguarding your identityTomTom ensures that your identity is protected through a two-step randomization process. First, we connect location data from every individual trip or session to a unique random ID. Then to prevent easy back-linking, we create a second random ID.Personalized experience, protected privacyIn some TomTom products, you can let us monitor your driving and app behavior over time so that we can create a better and more personalized experience for you. In this case, your privacy is protected with the same rigor of all TomTom security measures.Managing privacy around the clockWe apply ongoing data privacy management throughout our product development and maintenance cycle. This means that, for example, we know which data we collect from which sources, have insights into data flows, use tools to stay in control and assess privacy impacts.You use our products – they don’t use youUnlike many free products and services, you don’t pay with your privacy with TomTom. That means we’re not using you to make money in other ways. You are not the product. And when we design and engineer our products and services, privacy and properly dealing with data is a priority we consider right from the start and throughout engineering and operations.See what we’re doing with data and without your personal infoTomTom Traffic IndexWe use data to calculate congestion levels in cities around the world, providing accurate real-time and historical traffic information.Show meMapping the world, for the worldWe are mapping and re-mapping the world every day, using data to ensure our customers’ maps always reflect the reality on the road.Learn moreAccelerating safe automated drivingWe use vehicle sensor data to continuously update our highly detailed maps for self-driving vehicles, helping us increase safety and comfort in automated vehicles around the world.Show meAPIs and SDKs to build betterThanks to the quality of our global data, developers worldwide choose TomTom to build all kinds of location-enabled products.Learn moreTomTom is the safe choice, trusted on the road and online by our customers and partnersRead more about privacyCoronavirus apps: trading privacy for effectiveness?Read articleBeyond privacy regulations: an ethical approach to data usage in transportationRead articleData privacy in the era of the connected carRead articleWe can't talk about data privacy without developersRead articleTraffic and connected servicesHazard WarningsEV ServicesReal-Time TrafficSpeed Camera ServicesParking ServicesMap technologyHD MapADAS MapSD MapAutoStreamRoad AnalyticsHistorical Traffic StatsOrigin Destination AnalysisRoute MonitoringRoad Event ReporterAPIs and SDKsMap display APITraffic APIRouting APISearch APIOther APIs and SDKsGPS sat navs and appsNavigation devicesMaps and servicesAppsIndustriesAutomotiveFleet management and logisticsMobility and on-demandRoad traffic managementLocation intelligenceAbout usCompany informationInvestorCareersPress releasesBlogLegalPrivacy policyLegal informationTerms and conditionsUsing your dataReport vulnerabilitiesShopNavigation devicesMaps and servicesIn-dashUpdates helpUpdate supportNavigation supportNavigation get startedMap update supportDeveloper supportPortalsCustomer portalMove portalSuppliersReport a map changeCopyright © 2020 TomTom International BV.
