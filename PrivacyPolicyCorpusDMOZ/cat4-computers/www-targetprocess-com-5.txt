It applies to Services and Websites listed in Privacy Policy, which also includes additional details about the collection and use of information at Targetprocess. Please use our Cookie Settings panel (applicable to Targetprocess.com website) to change your preferred cookie settings.What is a cookie?Cookies are small text files sent by websites to your computer or mobile device that enable services and website features to function properly. Cookies are unique to your Targetprocess account and to your browser. Session-based cookies only last while your browser is open, and are automatically deleted when you close the browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.To find out more about cookies in general, visit this site.Does Targetprocess use cookies?Yes. Targetprocess uses cookies and similar technologies, such as single-pixel GIFs and web beacons. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Targetprocess sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Targetprocess and its corporate affiliates (collectively, the “Sites”). Additionally, for some websites and Services, we use third party cookies, such as Google Analytics.How is Targetprocess using cookies?Some cookies are associated with your account information so that your browser can remember if you are logged in, and which Service Instance you are logged in to. Other cookies are not tied to your account, but are unique and allow us to carry out analytics and customization.Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit a website or use our Services, to remember your preferences, and to give you a personalized experience that’s consistent with your preferred settings. Cookies also make your interactions faster and more secure. Please check the cookies table at the end of this document to learn more.Categories of UseDescriptionAuthenticationIf you're signed in to our Services, cookies help us to identify you and display the correct information.SecurityWe use cookies to enable and support our security features.Preferences, features and servicesCookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. They can help you fill out forms on websites more easily. They also provide you with features, insights, and customized content.MarketingWe may use cookies to help us deliver marketing campaigns and track their performance (e.g., a user visiting our Solutions Center and then purchasing the service). Similarly, our partners may use cookies to provide us with information about your interactions with their services, but use of those third-party cookies would be subject to the service provider’s policies.Performance, Analytics and ResearchCookies help us learn how well our Sites and Services perform. We may also use cookies to understand, improve, and analyze the usage of products, features, and services, including the creation of logs and records when you access our websites and Services from different devices.What third-party cookies does Targetprocess use?You can find a list of third-party cookies that Targetprocess uses on our websites and Services, along with some additional information in the cookies table at the end of this document. While we do our best to keep this table updated, please note that the number and names of cookies, pixels, and other technologies may change from time to time, and there may be a slight delay updating the table.How are cookies used for advertising purposesCookies and other advertising technologies, such as beacons, pixels, and e-tags, help us market more effectively to users that we and our partners believe may be interested in Targetprocess and other covered Services. They also help provide us with aggregated auditing, research, and reporting, and know when content has been shown to you. We only use advertising-related cookies and other technologies on our Websites, never on customer facing Service Instances.What can you do if you don't want cookies to be set, want them to be removed, or if you want to opt out of interest-based targeting?Some people prefer not to allow cookies or to only allow certain cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookie settings to suit you. In some browsers, you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site by site basis, giving you more granular control over your privacy. This means that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust, or to only allow first-party cookies from the sites you visit.Browser manufacturers provide help pages related to cookie management in their products. Please see below for more information.Google ChromeMozilla FirefoSafari (Desktop)Safari (Mobile)Android BrowserInternet ExplorerFor other browsers, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.You can opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://youradchoices.com). In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android device, you can change your device’s Privacy settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.If you limit the ability of websites and applications to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience and/or lose the ability to access services, because your browser will no longer be personalized to you. This may also prevent you from saving customized settings, such as login information.Does Targetprocess respond to Do Not Track Signals?Most of our websites and Services use our own first-party tracking that is an integral part of our Services and websites. This tracking provides required functionality. Therefore, we do not alter any of our data collection or practices upon receipt of such a signal. Third-party services that we use in some cases will act in accordance with their own policies, and will typically respond to DNT signals.Cookie tableInternal Cookies used by Targetprocess Services and websitesThe following are first-party cookies used on properties including targetprocess.com, *tpondemand.com, and other domains operated by Targetprocess.DomainCookie NameExpirationDescriptionXYZ.tpondemand.com.ASPXAUTHSessionAuthenticationXYZ.tpondemand.com.AspNet.CookiesSessionAuthenticationXYZ.tpondemand.comCometSessionLive updates sessionXYZ.tpondemand.comlocationSessionApproximate User locationXYZ.tpondemand.comuvts1 yearSession trackingXYZ.tpondemand.comfirst_session1 daySession cookie.cdntpondemand.com__cfduid1 yearTargetprocess CDN session.widget.uservoice.com__cfduid1 yearUservoice CDN trackingtargetprocess.com_plan_id1 dayAuthentication session idtargetprocess.comfirst_session1 dayApplication session trackingtargetprocess.com_pk_id.*13 monthsWeb session trackingtargetprocess.com_pk_id.*13 monthsWeb session trackingtargetprocess.com_pk_ses.*13 monthsWeb session trackingtargetprocess.comtp_tracking_code13 monthsWeb session trackingtargetprocess.comutm30 daysAdvertising analyticstargetprocess.comblog-email-subscribedSessionBlog subscription offer statustargetprocess.comcom-pop-up-book-27 daysEbook offer popup statustargetprocess.comcookie_policy_accepted30 daysCookie policy notice statusXYZ.fibery.ioring-sessionSessionAuthenticationvizydrop.com/spaces/XYZconnect.sid1 yearAuthenticationPerformance, Analytics, Research, and MarketingThe following are third-party cookies.DomainCookie NameExpirationDescriptionOpt-Outthird party1P_JAR5 yearsAdvertising (Google)Google Opt-Outthird partyIDE2 yearsTargeting/ Advertising (Google DoubleClick)Google Opt-Outthird partylidc1 dayAdvertising and Share buttons (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird partybcookie2 yearsBrowser ID Cookie (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird partypardotSessionUser settings and tracking  (Pardot)Pardot Cookies Overviewthird partyvisitor_id281210 yearsUser settings and tracking  (Pardot)Pardot Cookies Overviewthird party__unam9 monthsUser navigation data (Pardot)Pardot Cookies Overviewthird party_gid1 day ID to generate statistical data on how the visitor uses the websitePardot Cookies Overviewthird party_ga2 yearsID to generate statistical data on how the visitor uses the websitePardot Cookies Overviewthird partyvisitor_id2812-hash13 monthsUser settings and tracking  (Pardot)Pardot Cookies Overviewthird partywebact2 yearsAnalytics used to distinguish users (Google Analytics)Google Opt-Outthird partyDV1 dayAnalytics used to distinguish users (Google Analytics)Google Opt-Outthird partylangSessionAdvertising (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird partyBizoID6 monthsAdvertising and LinkedIn insights (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird partyUserMatchHistory6 monthsAdvertising and LinkedIn insights (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird partybscookie2 yearsAdvertising and LinkedIn insights (LinkedIn)LinkedIn Opt-Outthird party_ga2 yearsAnalytics used to distinguish users (Google Analytics)Google Opt-Outthird party_gid24 hoursAnalytics used to distinguish users (Google Analytics)Google Opt-Outthird party_gat1 minuteAnalytics used to throttle request rate (Google Analytics)Google Opt-Outthird party__cfduid1 yearPingdom performance trackingPingdom Cookie Policythird partyintercom-id-<id>SessionIntercom ID to connect website and Intercom accountIntercom Cookie Policythird partyproduct_store_identifier1 yearIntercom ID to identify the accountIntercom Cookie Policythird partyintercom-session-<id>1 yearIntercom id to distinguish usersIntercom Cookie Policythird partyajs_anonymous_id1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data Policythird partyajs_group_id1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data Policythird partyajs_user_id1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data Policythird partydevice_viewSessionTypeform view settingsTypeform Data Policythird partyattribution_user_id1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data Policythird partyfirst_interaction1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data Policythird partyzero_interaction1 yearTypeform usage statisticsTypeform Data PolicyIf you have any questions regarding the use of cookies at Targetprocess, please feel free to contact us at support@targetprocess.com or gdpr@targetprocess.com.Last update date: October 25th 2019.
