is Webdancers' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.Website VisitorsLike most website operators, Webdancers collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Webdancers' purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how Webdancers' visitors use its website. From time to
time, Webdancers may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.Webdancers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on www.webdancers.com
blogs/sites. Webdancers only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.Gathering of Personally-Identifying InformationCertain visitors to Webdancers' websites choose to interact
with Webdancers in ways that require Webdancers to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Webdancers gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at www.webdancers.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Webdancers are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, Webdancers collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
Webdancers. Webdancers does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.Aggregated StatisticsWebdancers may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. Webdancers may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Webdancers does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying InformationWebdancers discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on Webdancers' behalf or to provide services available
at Webdancers' websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using Webdancers' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. Webdancers will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Webdancers discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when Webdancers believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Webdancers, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an Webdancers website and have supplied your email address, Webdancers
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with Webdancers and our products. If you send us a request (for
