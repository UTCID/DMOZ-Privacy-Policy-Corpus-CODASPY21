Terms and ConditionsRISK OF LOSSAll items purchased from Fleeman Anderson & Bird Corp (FAB) are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. All packages will be appropriately insured to protect your purchase. Our default carrier for shipments within The U.S.A. (domestic) as well as for shipments outside of The U.S.A. (international) is United Parcel Service (UPS). Shipments to APO & FPO addresses will default to The United States Postal Service (USPS), using Priority Mail service. Customers may request FAB use their shipping account information for shipments. FAB will attempt to accommodate this request, however this may not always be possible as we occasionally ship orders from Manufactures who will not allow the use of third party shipping accounts. In this case we will notify the customer with the cost of shipping based on the quote we receive. Domestically we will ship with UPS, FedEx and USPS Priority or Express Mail Service (EMS). Internationally we will ship with UPS, FedEx and USPS EMS only.ADDITIONAL CHARGESItems returned to FAB by the shipping carrier as a result of customer error, or inability for the carrier to make delivery to the address provided will be the responsibility of the customer to pay for return shipping of the carrier to FAB. This will be charged to your on file credit card. If the error was on the part of FAB Corp we will cover return shipping charges to us and back to you again. If the customer provides a incorrect or incomplete address, the customer may be assessed a $12.50 address correction charge as imposed by FedEx, UPS, or whatever charge is imposed by your selected carrier. This will be billed to the customers on file credit card (this only applies to errors made by the customer).Domestic customers wishing to use their own shipping account number, will be assessed a $5.00 handling charge. International customers wishing to use their own shipping account number will be assessed a $10.00 handling charge. If for any reason we are charged for your shipment, incorrect account number, refusal to pay for shipment by you, etc, we will charge your on-file credit card for the amount we are charged for your shipment.Returned checks that have not been honored by the customer's bank fall 100% to the responsibility of the customer. All returned checks fall under the jurisdiction of the laws for the State of Florida and will be assessed a $25.00 or 5% service fee whichever is the higher of the two dollar amounts. FAB Corp will take any and all measures to ensure returned checks are paid. This includes but is not limited to charging previously used charge cards, legal action civil and criminal as well as liens. Use of a check to pay for services constitutes your agreement to these terms.PRICING & SHIPPING DISCREPANCIESPricing and shipping discrepancies must submitted within 30 days of your initial order. You agree that all amounts charged if not contested within 30 days are true and correct. You agree that all shipments not contested within 30 days are fulfilled and complete.TERM ACCOUNTSIndividual term accounts, (ie Net 15, Net 30, etc) are subject to the terms and conditions stated in each customers credit application as well as terms listed on each invoice. Term accounts which are past due are subject to a 18% APR on all overdue balances. In the event a term account goes unpaid we reserve the right to use any means to collect including charging any previously used credit cards that we have on file to pay for past due balances.DUTIESIn some situations FAB may be charged duties by your local government for international shipments. Customs duties, brokerage fees, etc are 100% the responsibility of the customer. FAB has no control over these fees and cannot be held responsible for them. These fees are set by the respective country you are in along with the shipping company. Typically UPS, FedEx or any other courier used will collect this from you at the time of delivery. However sometimes they are unable to do so for any number of reasons and we are charged duties for your package. In this event, we will pay the duties owed however your on file charge card will be used to pay these taxes. The amount of any such charges will be the exact dollar amount charged by the carrier to us. When this occurs you will be notified by e-mail and a copy of the customs charges will be attached.On a different note about customs duties. Occasionally we are asked to declare a package with a lower value than what you paid. Sometimes we are asked to mark the package “gift” or “sample” so the buyer can avoid paying duties. For us to do this is illegal and puts us at risk as well as the party requesting this. As such we will not falsify any documentation under any circumstance, so please do not ask us to do so.PRIVACYFAB Corp respects your privacy.
