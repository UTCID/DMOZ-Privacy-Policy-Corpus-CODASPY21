Here at Ninja Forge, we like our privacy as much as you do. So we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors and members. There is however a certain amount of information that we must collect in order to provide for you the best experience possible.
This policy is to let you know just how we will handle and protect your personal information
What information do we need to collect?

Cookies
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We use the cookies on Ninja Forge to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website, provide you with your own personal account and information, and to give you access to the appropriate downloads, videos and tools for your membership level.
These cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until several hours have passed since you last visited our site.
We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on members' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html .
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.  (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.)  This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one, as you will not be able to log into your account or access your membership entitlements.
