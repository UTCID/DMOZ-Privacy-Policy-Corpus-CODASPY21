The law also provides that if the company has a privacy notice that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Since Keytronic is, via this privacy notice, providing you with details on how to either opt out or opt in to use of your personal information by third parties, Keytronic qualifies for the latter option and is therefore not required to disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purpose during the preceding year.You may learn more about your rights under California’s privacy laws athttps://oag.ca.gov/privacy/privacy-laws.t
