Other technologies and types of cookiesCookies are not the only way of recognising or tracking visitors to a website. On a case-by-case basis, Board could use other technologies or instruments for the same or similar purposes for which it uses the cookies. In particular:Web Beacons. Board could use this technology, which consists of small graphic files containing a unique identifier which is used to recognise when someone has visited the Website or has opened an e-mail sent by Board. This is used to monitor the user traffic models from a page on the Website to another and to confer or communicate with the cookies, to understand if you have visited the Website following an advertisement displayed on a third party website, and to improve the performance of the Website and assess the success of the e-mail marketing campaigns. In many cases, these technologies rely on cookies to work correctly and therefore by refusing them the operation of these technologies could be compromised.Social media functions. The Website could, on a case by case basis, use social media functions, such as the “like” button on Facebook. These functions may gather your IP address and the page you are visiting on the Website and may set a cookie to ensure the correct operation of the function. This function may include the possibility to publish information on your activities on the Website on a page of your profile provided by a third party social media network to share it with others in your network. The social media functions, where used by Board, are hosted by a third party or direct on the Website. Your interactions with these functions are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the social media functions.Flash cookies: the Website could also use this type of cookie, for example to gather and archive information on the use of Board services, to prevent fraud or other operations via the Website. If you do not wish Flash cookies to be archived on your computer, you can set the Flash Player settings to prevent their archiving, using the tools in the website archiving settings. You can also control Flash cookies from the “General storage settings” and following the instructions (which may include instructions which explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash cookies, how to prevent these cookies from entering your computer without being asked (for Flash Player 8 and subsequent versions) how to block Flash cookies which are not provided by the manager of the web page you are on at that moment). Flash Player settings to limit or limit the acceptance of Flash cookies may reduce or hinder the functions of some Flash applications, including, potentially, the Flash applications used in connection to the services of Board or Website contents.Targeted and mobile online advertising: Board could appoint one or more third parties, service providers, to track and analyse both individual use and statistical information on the volume of interactions with the Website. These providers may also offer cookies to your computer or mobile device for advertising purposes via the Website and provide other personalisation services in conformity with this Cookie Policy. These companies may gather and use information relating to visits to the Website and other sites to provide pertinent product and service advertising which could interest you. They may also use the technology used to measure and monitor the effectiveness of advertising through the use of cookies or web beacons. The information gathered through this process does not allow Board to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you decide to provide it. 5.
