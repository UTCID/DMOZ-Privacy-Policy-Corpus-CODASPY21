Privacy on jetaudio.com - An Overview
JetAudio, Inc. (JetAudio) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its
interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute
to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers. The purpose of this jetaudio.com
privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to jetaudio.com, what
kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit jetaudio.com,
how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the
choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the
information.
Other JetAudio products and services may also have their own privacy policies, which
you should review when you use these services. Finally, please note that this
policy applies only to jetaudio.com, and not to other companies' or
organizations' Web sites to which we link.
Information About All jetaudio.com Visitors
In general, our site
automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency
of visitors to jetaudio.com and its areas, very much like television ratings
that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such
data in the aggregate.
This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the
site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can
make it for as many of you as possible. For example, jetaudio.com uses a
technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in
our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we
do not combine information collected through these cookies with other
personally identifiable information
to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We
also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information
about you personally, to our jetaudio.com partners about how our members,
collectively, use jetaudio.com. We do this so they too can understand how much
people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the
best possible Web experience as well.
Finally, jetaudio.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as
well as small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear
gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and
promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use
these technologies to
collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do
so.
Information About You
If you are an jetaudio.com member, when
you access jetaudio.com you may obtain access to features of
the jetaudio.com service that contain personal information.
Additionally, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign
up to use a service or when you order a product. We will need certain
information -- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address,
type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or
product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional
products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not
to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the
registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you
for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage
of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond
or not.
Disclosure
We do not use or disclose information
about your individual visits to jetaudio.com or information that you may give
us on jetaudio.com, such as your name, address, email address or telephone
number, to any outside companies. jetaudio.com may share such information in
response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or in special
cases such as a physical threat to you or others.
And, as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated
statistical "ratings" information about the use of jetaudio.com.
