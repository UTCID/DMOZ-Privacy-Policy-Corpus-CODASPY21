INFORMATION COLLECTION
Information You Provide
The Platforms may request that you provide certain personal information, which is information that may reasonably be used to identify you as a specific individual, directly or indirectly
(Personal Information). It does not include information where your identity has been removed, deidentified or made anonymous. We may collect, use, store, and transfer different kinds of Personal Information, which we have grouped together as follows:
Identity Data includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier.
Contact Data includes billing address, home address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data includes payment card details, zip code, expiration date, and security code (collected and tokenized by our payment processor).
Transaction Data includes details about products and services you have bought from us, and details about your purchase history, including payments received, and when you have requested information or asked questions, communication and call data, including with customer service, membership dates, card-sending history, including Recipient Data (defined below) and personal messages or sentiments that you enter for card sending.
Profile Data includes your username and password, products and services bought by you, information about your preferences, interests, inquiries, feedback, and survey responses, and demographic information (including, your gender, ZIP code, or marital status).
Recipient Data includes the first name, last name, email address, or significant dates (such as birthdays or anniversaries) that you provide for card sending.
Usage Data includes information as to how and where you use our Platforms.
Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences as to whether you are happy to receive marketing from us.
The Platforms may also enable you to transmit files or otherwise provide information to American Greetings. Please note that files you transmit may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information. For example, photos you transmit could include metadata indicating where (e.g., GPS coordinates) and when (date and time) the photo was taken.
We also collect, use, and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Information but is not considered Personal Information in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. If we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Information, which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Information The Platforms Automatically Collect
We and our third-party service providers collect certain information about your use of our Platforms (Usage Data). Usage Data may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL, advertisements, or search terms that referred or otherwise led you to the Platforms (if applicable), aspects of the Platforms that you use or visit, the products or services you access or view, the types of greeting cards that you send, and the time of day you accessed the Platforms, among other information.
Usage Data also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (Device Identifier) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a Device) used to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Please note that your IP address is included in the header information of every ecard notification email that we send for your ecards. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Platforms. Usage Data is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
The methods used to collect Usage Information may include:
Cookies
A cookie or local storage is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit a Platform or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to the Platforms. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. You can find more information about cookies and how they work by visiting the website allaboutcookies.org.
A Flash Cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, such as enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. Flash cookies may not be deleted when you delete other types of cookies from a Device. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Platforms or our content may not function properly.
In order to enjoy the Platform fully, below is information about one such vendor we use across one or more Platforms.
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track use of our Platforms, Google drops a cookie (_ga) with a randomly-generated ID in your browser for logged-in users (a UserID). This UserID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, or name. We also send Google your IP Address. We use Google Analytics to track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is important to us for improving overall user experience and determining the Platform effectiveness. You can learn about Google's practices by going to google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This opt-out feature, however, only works on your desktop browser and not on a mobile device. For mobile apps, you may be able to limit certain advertising practices using the settings on your phone, tablet or other mobile device. You may also download the AppChoices app at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices to opt out of the delivery of interest-based advertisements in participating mobile apps.
Our Platforms use other third-party performance and remarketing cookies, and further information on those third-party cookies is located in our Cookie Policy or can be obtained by contacting us at help@americangreetings.com.

Web Beacons and Pixels
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as pixel tags, 1x1 GIFs, or clear GIFs) may be used on the Platforms or in our emails and may be invisible to you.
Web beacons may be connected to your Personal Information, if you have provided it.
Web beacons may be used for various purposes, such as counting visitors to the Platforms, monitoring how users navigate the Platforms, counting how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or counting how many times a link was accessed.
Back to top
Location-Identifying Technologies
The Platforms may also use global positioning systems (GPS) software and other location-based technologies, such as iBeacons, to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location to others as part of the Services we provide.
We may determine your approximate or exact location information to provide location-based services. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install other types of location-tracking technology. These technologies emit a signal that we can use to detect to pinpoint your proximity to those locations (such as, how close you are to retail locations and products) or otherwise interact with the Platform (such as to send you helpful information, offers, and discounts).
Back to top
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platforms, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Platform, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Back to top
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (DNT) is a preference available in many web browsers that allow you to inform websites that you visit that you do not want them collecting information about you.
The Platforms do not currently support recognition of DNT signals sent by a browser, which means we may collect information about you.
We operate, however, as described in this Privacy Notice whether or not a DNT signal is received.
For more information regarding DNT you can visit https://allaboutdnt.com.

Information You Provide About Third Parties
The Platforms may permit you to provide Personal Information about third parties (Recipient Data), such as mailing address, email addresses, or significant dates (such as birthdays or anniversaries). If you use the Platforms to send an ecard, paper card, gift card, or any other content, we collect certain Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing address, and email address, as applicable). We may share the information regarding your transaction with third parties as necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to create, send or deliver the card). If you choose to provide Recipient Data we will store that information only in connection with your relationship with us (e.g., to send greeting cards).
Back to top
Information Third Parties Provide About You
We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from American Greetings, the other website will forward your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Further, we may receive certain information about you from third parties if you engage the third parties in connection with our Platforms -- for example, if you download one of our apps from an app store, make an in-app purchase, connect via Social Networking Features, or make a payment using a third-party payment provider like PayPal, consistent with the privacy policies of the applicable third parties.

When we refer to legitimate interests we mean the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and products.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests.

THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICE PROVIDERS; ONLINE TRACKING
We work with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) for a variety of business purposes. These purposes include providing us with information regarding traffic and use of the Platforms and our advertisements on the Platforms and across the Internet, and to engage in multi-site advertising.
For example, if you click on an advertisement that led you to one of our Platforms, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement; or, you may be served American Greetings' advertisements elsewhere online based on your visit to or use of the Platforms. Some of these third parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Platforms or other websites or online services. Additionally, we may share certain information derived from your Personal Information with third parties to assist us in delivering content or advertising to you, both on the Platforms and elsewhere online.
These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Data and related information about you. These service providers may use that information for their own purposes, including to target advertisements to you, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share the Device Identifier and Usage Data about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.
American Greetings does not control the information collection, use, or sharing practices of third-party analytics providers or advertisers. Some of these parties may collect your Personal Information when you access the Platforms or other online websites and services.

We may post customer testimonials on our Platforms, which may contain User Content or Personal Information. We will obtain your consent to post your name along with your testimonial via email prior to posting the testimonial on our Platforms.

Back to top
Data Retention
We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances we may anonymize, hash, or de-identify your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Details of retention periods for different types of your Personal Information are available in our Corporate Records Retention Policy, which you can request from us at help@americangreetings.com.
In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your Personal Information by following the Request erasure right as outlined in Section VII.
Back to top
YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Depending on where you reside, you may have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information, including:
Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law.
If we are not able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal reasons, we will tell you at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on our legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.
Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following situations: (a) if you want us to establish the data accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at help@americangreetings.com.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity or the identity of your appointed agent and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to enable us to deal with your request or to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or we have received a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Children's Privacy
The Platforms are not intended for children, and AG Companies do not knowingly collect information from persons younger than the age of sixteen (16).

Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.

Processors we appoint will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and they are subject to a contractual duty of confidentiality.
You should be aware, however, that transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.

Consent to Transfer
Please be aware that information we collect through the Platforms may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
For residents or citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA), whenever we transfer your Personal Information, we look to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Transferring your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission.
Where we transfer data to AG Companies, and when we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Information the same protection it has in Europe.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between the Europe and the US.
By using the Platforms or providing us with any information, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States, or such other countries as American Greetings may choose in its sole discretion.
