Non-WordPress Activities on WordPress Servers
In order to maintain performance, security, and value standards for all of our WordPress hosting offerings (defined for the purposes of this policy as WP Enthusiast and WP Professional), we must limit the acceptable uses of a WordPress hosting account and associated hardware. The use of a WordPress hosting account and associated hardware for services, operations, processes, or projects not related to and necessary for the operation of a WordPress Web site is prohibited. Use of a WordPress hosting account for unapproved services, operations, processes, or projects may result in intervention or action from Pair Networks.
