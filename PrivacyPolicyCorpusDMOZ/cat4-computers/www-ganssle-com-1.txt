We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people have an absolute right to privacy.
We collect two kinds of data from you:
If you subscribe to The Embedded Muse newsletter, we log your email address so we can deliver it each month.

We never reveal your information to anyone, despite promises of wealth, fame, recovery of lost youth and desperately-needed full-body makeovers.
The only email you'll get from us is The Embedded Muse, unless you correspond with us, in which case we'll respond.
Unlike nearly every other newsletter, we don't track links.
We don't use cookies.

use any sort of analytics.
