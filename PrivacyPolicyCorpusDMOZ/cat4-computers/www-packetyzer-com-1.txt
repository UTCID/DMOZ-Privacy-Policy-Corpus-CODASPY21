Like most website operators, Packet Tech Hub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Packet Tech Hub's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Packet Tech Hub's visitors use its website. From time to time, Packet Tech Hub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Packet Tech Hub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.packetyzer.com blogs/sites.

In each case, Packet Tech Hub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Packet Tech Hub. Packet Tech Hub does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
