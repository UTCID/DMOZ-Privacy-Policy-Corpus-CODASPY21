Effective Date: 23 May 2018
Last updated: 23 May 2018
This Privacy Policy applies to the sites and apps where it appears.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other channels.

We collect other information. If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you’re using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may collect your precise, real-time location using GPS, cell phone towers, Wi-Fi signals, and/or beacon technology (including Apple’s iBeacon), and/or future technologies. We might look at how often you use an app and where you downloaded it. We collect this information using the tracking tools described below and in compliance with the applicable local law. To control those tools, please read the choices section below.
We collect information in different ways.
We collect information that you give to us. For example, if you sign on for our services.
We collect information about you automatically. Where permitted by law we use tracking tools such as browser cookies and web beacons to collect information from you. We collect information about users over time when you use this website.
We may have third parties collect personal information this way. We also collect information from our mobile apps.
We get information about you from third parties. Where permitted by law, we may share information with third parties with whom we do business. We may get information from persons acting on your behalf. We may also get information from social media platforms and advertising and analytics providers.
We combine information. For example, we may combine information that we have collected offline with information we collect online, to the extent covered by the transactional purpose or your consent. Or we may combine information we get from a third party with information we already have.
We use information as disclosed and described here, subject to any consent required by applicable law.
We use the information to respond to your requests or questions. For example, we will use your information to provide the services you request, such as to fulfill a request for IT services or solutions, or to ask you to participate in a customer survey. Where legally permitted, we may use your personal data to personalize your experience with us. We might use your information to respond to a question about our services or products. We use social security numbers and tax ID numbers to process tax documents.
We use the information to improve our websites and services. We may use your information to make services better. We might use your information to customize your experience with us. Where legally permitted, we may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.
We use the information to administer our site and for internal operations. For example, we may aggregate or anonymize your information for analytics, research or other business purposes.
We use information for security purposes. Where legally permitted, we may use your information to protect our company, our customers, and our websites.
We use information for marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about new services or special offers. We might tell you about new IT solutions or updates. These might be third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting. If you register with us, we’ll send you our promotional emails. We obtain consents as required by law before marketing to you. To manage this, read the choices section below. We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps.
We use the information to communicate with you about your account or our relationship. We may contact you about your account or for feedback. We might also contact you about this Privacy Policy or our Site Usage Terms and Conditions.
We use information as otherwise disclosed or permitted by law.
We may share information with third parties.
We will share information within our branch offices unless legally prohibited. For example, we will share your information to facilitate services or to customize offers to your preference.
We will share your information with data processors that perform services on our behalf. For example, we share information with vendors who send emails and other communications for us. We also share information with companies that help us operate our sites or run promotions and advertisers and advertising networks that assist us in marketing and advertising our products and services. Some vendors may be located in a country other than where you live. We may also share information with analytics and search engine providers who act on our behalf.
We may share information with our business partners unless legally prohibited. For example, we might share information with third parties who co-sponsor a promotion. Some of these partners may send you information about product or services by mail or email where legally permitted or based on your prior consent.
We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves, our customers or others. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena, or in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Or, when required by law, we may share your information if you are the winner of a contest or other contest with anyone who requests a winner’s list. We may share information in order to enforce our Site Usage Terms and Conditions or other agreements, and to protect the rights of others. We might share if we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a promotion.
We may share information with a successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business or assets are sold, we may disclose user information as part of that transaction. You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.
You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, you can visit your account settings on the site or follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions.
You can control participation in our iBeacon program. iBeacons are electronic devices that broadcast signals that can be received by mobile devices on which one of our mobile apps is installed. If you have voluntarily installed one of our apps on your device, and if you have granted permission for the app to track your location, then iBeacons installed in our offices may send a signal to the app on your device about the precise, real-time location of the device. The app may use this information to deliver special offers and promotions to you, at a time and place when the information is most relevant. As a convenience to you, receipt of the iBeacons signal and delivery of the special offer or promotion may occur even if you are not currently using the app. To make our mobile apps and services operate better, we may also collect other information based on iBeacon signals, for example, the strength of the signal between the iBeacon and your device, the duration your device is near the iBeacon, or the battery level of the iBeacon itself. To avoid having us receive or use your precise, real-time location, do not opt-in to location services. If you did opt in and have changed your mind, you may opt-out of location services through your device settings or by deleting the app.
You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the location services or push notifications on your phone. Choices you make are device specific.

Information about European Union and Switzerland residents may be sent to the U.S., where it is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Ad and Cookie Policy, the U E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields. Amnet complies with the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland (please note that the Privacy Shields principles do not necessarily apply to the collection, use, and retention of personal information from other countries).

If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. U.S. laws may not afford the same level or protection as those in your country.
