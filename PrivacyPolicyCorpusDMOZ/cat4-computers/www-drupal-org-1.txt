Our Terms of Service
Welcome to Drupal.org! The Drupal Association ("Association", "we" or "us") is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to unite a global open source community to build and promote Drupal. Part of our work includes maintaining and improving the infrastructure and software that fuel Drupal.org. We welcome you (the “user”, “you”) as a contributor of code, training, documentation, design, and plain old opinions to the Drupal Project. Before you create an account on this Website, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”).
Overview
These Terms of Service are meant to tell you about the services the Association provides through Drupal.org, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. Although the Association makes Drupal.org available to the community, it is the community, including you, that creates the majority of contributions to the site. Our intent is to provide a platform for the community to do its work.
The Drupal community is actively engaged in the governance and improvement of Drupal.org. This includes code contributions as well as oversight provided by members of the Drupal.org Content, Software, and Infrastructure Working Groups. As the organization with legal responsibility for Drupal.org, the Association asks that you follow the policies outlined in this Terms of Service.
The following terms and conditions (including any documents referred to in them) (collectively, the "Terms of Service"), apply to your use of the Drupal.org website and all *.drupal.org subsites (collectively, the "Website"), as well as any content, functionality and services offered to you, whether as a guest or a registered user, on or through the Website.
Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, which can be found at http://drupal.org/privacy.
The Website is operated by the Drupal Association with the help of the Drupal community. We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Service, we will notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your user account, at least 72 hours prior to the changes being effective. We will publish a notice on the Website as well. Your continued use of the Website (publishing content) following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.

Highlighted for emphasis:
We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Service.
Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.
At the Association, we do our best to provide quality content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.
4. Limitation on liability. In no event will the Association, its affiliates or their licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind, under any legal theory, arising out of or in connection with your use, or inability to use, the Website, any websites linked to it, any content on the Website or such other websites or any services or items obtained through the Website or such other websites, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, including but not limited to, personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, loss of data, and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable. The foregoing does not affect any liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
5. Arbitration. All disputes (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether statutory, common law or equitable and whether pre-existing, present or future) against the Association, its agents, employees, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Association Affiliates"), relating to these Terms or any aspect of the Website will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the Arbitration Service of Portland, Inc. ("ASP") under its arbitration rules then in effect. You may obtain a copy of those rules by writing to ASP at 620 SW 5th Avenue, Suite 1010, Portland, Oregon 97204, United States of America, by downloading the rules from ASP's website, http://www.arbserve.com, or by telephoning ASP at +1 503-226-3109 or +1-800-423-1216. That arbitration will be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator and will be limited solely to the dispute between the Association and you, the user. The arbitration will be conducted in Portland, Oregon, or by telephone or online. Any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either you or the Association may, without violating this provision, seek from a court any equitable relief that may be necessary to protect the rights or property of that person pending the appointment of an arbitrator (or pending the arbitrator's determination of the merits of the controversy), and in those cases, you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Oregon, you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in those courts and any claim that forum is inconvenient, and you agree not to initiate any proceeding against the Association in any other jurisdiction.
6. Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Website must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.
7. Waiver and Severability. If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or the arbitrator to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
8. The Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and the Association with respect to the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Website.
