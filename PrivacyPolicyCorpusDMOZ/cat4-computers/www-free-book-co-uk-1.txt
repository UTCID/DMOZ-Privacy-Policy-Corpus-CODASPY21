it?
When you

If you
enter a contest or other promotional
feature, we may ask for your name, address

We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site
usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.
What about "cookies"?
"Cookies"

other method to store information on your computer. Our belief is that if you want
us to know something about you, you will
tell us.
The only time cookies may be experienced when visiting this site will be to prevent you

window on a page, you will only see it
once and that is ensured via the use of a cookie.
