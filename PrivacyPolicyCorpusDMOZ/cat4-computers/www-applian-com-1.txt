Information We Collect and Why
Applian Technologies is the sole owner of the information collected on this
site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to anyone.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the customer’s hard drive containing
information about the customer.   We use
cookies to track how customers got to our site.
The information is anonymous.  You
don’t need to keep cookies on your computer to use our site.

When you download
a piece of software from Applian Technologies, we ask for your e-mail address
so we can keep you informed of our new products.  By entering your email address, you agree to
receive email from us about product updates and special deals. When we release
a new product or a new version of any of our software titles, we send a message
to all of our registered customers and let them know.  If you wish not to receive these messages,

We request information from the customer on our order form. Here a customer
must provide contact information (like name and

used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble
processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer.

All credit card information is requested and transmitted securely by these
third party companies. We never store any credit card information in our
databases.

We occasionally ask for anonymous usage information through random
surveys.  The surveys allow us to better
understand our audience and their interests.
The primary purpose of these surveys is to help us in creating products
that are of greater interest to our customer base.

other contact information. This information is used to contact the customer
about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest, and to
allow a more intense involvement in Applian Technologies community. It is
optional for the customer to provide demographic information, but encouraged so
we can provide a more personalized experience on our site and continue to
