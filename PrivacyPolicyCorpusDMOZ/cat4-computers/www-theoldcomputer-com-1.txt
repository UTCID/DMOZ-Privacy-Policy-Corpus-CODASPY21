Privacy
Policy
The
Old Computer Dot Com respects your privacy in all
aspects of what we do. Please read our privacy policy.
Our
Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect
your privacy we provide this notice explaining
our online information practices and the choices
you can make about the way your information
is collected and used. To make this notice easy
to find, we make it available on our homepage
and at every point where personally identifiable
information may be requested.
The
Information We Collect:
This
notice applies to all information collected
or submitted on the old computer dot com website.
On some pages, you can order products, make
requests, and register to receive materials.
The types of personal information collected
at these pages are:
Name
Address
Email address
The Way We
Use Information:
We
use the information you provide about yourself
when placing an order only to complete that
order. We do not share this information with
outside parties except to the extent necessary
to complete that order.
We
use the information you provide about someone
else when placing an order only to ship the
product and to confirm delivery. We do not share
this information with outside parties except
to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We
use return email addresses to answer the email
we receive. Such addresses are not used for
any other purpose and are not shared with outside
parties.
We
use non-identifying and aggregate information
to better design our website and to share with
advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser
that X number of individuals visited a certain
area on our website, or that Y number of men
and Z number of women filled out our registration
form, but we would not disclose anything that
could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally,
we never use or share the personally identifiable
information provided to us online in ways unrelated
to the ones described above without also providing
you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit
such unrelated uses.
Our
Commitment To Data Security
To
prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,
and ensure the correct use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
the information we collect online.
Our
Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting
the privacy of the very young is especially
important. For that reason, we never collect
or maintain information at our website from
those we actually know are under 13, and no
part of our website is structured to attract
anyone under 13.
How
You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You
can access all your personally identifiable
information that we collect online and maintain.
We use this procedure to better safeguard your
information.
You
can correct factual errors in your personally
identifiable information by sending us a request
that credibly shows error.
To
protect your privacy and security, we will also
take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before granting access or making corrections.
How
To Contact Us
Should
you have other questions or concerns about these
privacy policies, please send us an email at
