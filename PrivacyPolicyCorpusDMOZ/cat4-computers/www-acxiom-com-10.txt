On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated Privacy Shield as a Transfer Mechanism for data between EU and US companies. Acxiom intends to utilize alternate transfer mechanisms going forward for data transfers. Even though Privacy Shield was invalidated, Acxiom will continue to honor its commitments with respect to EU personal data transferred pursuant to Privacy Shield before July 16, 2020.Acxiom LLC (referred to herein as “Acxiom,” “we,” “us,” or “our” as applicable), has created this Privacy Shield Privacy Notice to help you understand how we are subject to and comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. These frameworks are established by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Switzerland to the United States. Acxiom has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.Acxiom is committed to educating individuals, our clients, and employees in the United States and in the EU, the UK, and Switzerland about the issues, guidelines and laws surrounding compliance with Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
Scope We provide customized computer services designed to help companies manage their customer information more effectively, increase marketing profitability and reduce the operational costs of processing customer transactions.The type of Personal Data transferred to Acxiom from the EU, the UK and Switzerland pursuant to Privacy Shield consists of Personal Data from clients in the EU, the UK and Switzerland that Acxiom processes on behalf of its clients, such as end-user name, address, email and transaction information. Since the requirements for compliance with Privacy Shield vary depending on whether we are acting as a Processor on behalf of our clients or as a Controller, our policies and manner of compliance are described separately below.The practices we employ under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, as outlined also apply to data transferred from Switzerland to the United States in compliance with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Acxiom will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles for as long as it retains such data.
Purposes of Data Processing Acxiom acts as a data processor with respect to Personal Data we receive from our clients and process such information only under the instruction of our clients and are controlled by our clients in the EU, the UK and/or Switzerland. In this capacity, we do not own or control any of the information we process on behalf of our clients. All such information is owned and controlled by our clients. In this capacity, we receive information transferred from the EU, the UK and Switzerland to the United States merely as a Processor on behalf of our clients.Before starting any processing on behalf of our clients, we enter into a processing contract with the Controller that ensures the Controller is in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) or Member State Data Protection law that may apply. The processing contract will also specify that the processing will be carried out with appropriate data security measures. We have measures in place designed to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.Any data processed by us will not be further disclosed to third parties except where permitted or required by the processing contract, Privacy Shield, GDPR, or the applicable Member State Data Protection law. Any information our client (acting as the Controller) identifies as sensitive, will be treated accordingly.When Acxiom provides business and consumer information products, we act as a Controller of the Personal Data contained in the information products.

Notice We may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Prior to the transfer of Personal Data from the EU, the UK or Switzerland to the United States, we require contractual confirmation from the Controller from whom we acquired the information that the Personal Data has been provided to us in accordance with GDPR, Privacy Shield, or the applicable EU Member State Data Protection law, thereby ensuring the data subjects have been provided with proper notice regarding how their Personal Data will be used. In addition, when Personal Data is collected directly from data subjects, we provide the data subject with notice regarding the manner and circumstances in which the Personal Data will be used and transferred to third parties.
