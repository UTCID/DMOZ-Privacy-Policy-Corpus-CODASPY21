WillyWeather assumes no liability for damages arising from the use of these notifications. Account holders accept the possibility that the data dispatched may not match the data on our website at the time the dispatches are made, either through problems with our data suppliers, or through system failures as described in section 8(e) of this document.Account holders also accept that while the data dispatched with the notifications may be correct, due to the nature of weather being unpredictable as described in section 8(d) of this document, any risks associated with activities undertaken by account holders as a result of this weather information is undertaken with the knowledge of the inherent risks associated with relying on such information.Account holders also accept the possibility of system failures as described in section 8(e) of this document, and the fact that notifications may be delayed or not sent out at all at any stage throughout the life of the website.SMS notifications, alerts and reports are delivered through a 3rd party SMS gateway.
