Virtual Items
From time to time during Your use of the Service, You may have the opportunity to “earn”, “buy” or “purchase” (a) virtual in-game items; or (b) virtual in-game points, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash or points, all for use in the Service (together with virtual in-game items, “Virtual Items”). You do not in fact “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real points or its equivalent. Rather, by “earning”, “buying”, or “purchasing” Virtual Items (whether through the use of Facebook Credits or virtual points), You are granted a limited license to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Virtual Items. In the event PLAYSTUDIOS encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Virtual Items, PLAYSTUDIOS reserves the right to correct any such errors. The purchase and sale, with Facebook Credits, of such limited licenses to use Virtual Items, is a completed transaction upon redemption of the applicable Facebook Credits and shall under no circumstances be refundable, transferable or exchangeable including, without limitation, upon termination of Your Account, termination of these Terms, and/or the discontinuation of the Service. PLAYSTUDIOS prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Service, or the purported sale, gift or trade of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless otherwise expressly authorized by PLAYSTUDIOS in writing. Accordingly, You may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game, without PLAYSTUDIOS’ written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject Your Account to termination. You acknowledge and agree: (a) that PLAYSTUDIOS may change the price of Virtual Items at any time, without notice, for any reason or for no reason, (b) that the amount of virtual points necessary to obtain certain Virtual Items may fluctuate, and (c) that PLAYSTUDIOS has no liability to You for any changes in the price of such Virtual Items and/or the amount of virtual points necessary to obtain Virtual Items. PLAYSTUDIOS reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the quantity of the Virtual Items You can purchase and/or to refuse to allow You to purchase such Virtual Items. You acknowledge and agree that PLAYSTUDIOS shall have no liability for loss of Virtual Items due to any unauthorized third party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, social engineering, and/or any other unauthorized third party activity. PLAYSTUDIOS may replace such lost Virtual Items at its sole discretion on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any further obligation or liability.PLAYSTUDIOS owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears on or in the Service, including all such content owned by our Rewards Partners and their affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, You agree that You have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without limitation the Virtual Items therein, whether “earned” in a game or “purchased” from PLAYSTUDIOS.
Loyalty Points
You will have the opportunity to accumulate “Loyalty Points” through Your use of the Service. Loyalty Points are virtual in-game points that You can use to “purchase” other Virtual Items within the Service. As with all Virtual Items, You do not in fact own the Loyalty Points You accumulate and the amounts of any Loyalty Points You accumulate do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, by “earning”, “buying”, or “purchasing” Loyalty Points, You are merely granted a limited license to use the software programs that manifest themselves as the Loyalty Points. In the event PLAYSTUDIOS encounters issues with the game that impact the accumulation of Loyalty Points and/or the redemption of Rewards, PLAYSTUDIOS reserves the right to correct any such errors. If You participate in any of our Rewards Partners’ rewards programs (including but not limited to M life), the Loyalty Points You accumulate through Your use of the Service may be exchanged for items, services or experiences (each a “Reward”) offered by such Rewards Partners through those programs.
Accumulating Loyalty Points
You may accumulate Loyalty Points by taking certain actions while using the Services. For example, You may earn Loyalty Points by posting Your in-game achievements to your Facebook account, “liking” certain aspects of the Service, playing the games for a specified duration, or participating in certain in-game offers. The foregoing list is solely for purposes of example and explanation and is not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive. Loyalty Points are NOT and WILL NOT be awarded or earned in any way related to or based upon the outcome of any game You play during Your use of the Services.
Using Loyalty Points
You may exchange Your accumulated Loyalty Points for in-game Virtual Items in the Service. You may also exchange Your Loyalty Points for Rewards in the “Rewards” area of the Service. In order to redeem a Reward, you must have a valid Facebook account and have connected the Application to your Facebook account. The first time you exchange Your Loyalty Points for Rewards, You will be asked to provide Your name and email address. The name you provide must match the name that appears on a government-issued identification belonging to the person who has accumulated the Loyalty Points through his/her use of the Service. The identification will be used by our Rewards Partners to verify Your eligibility.
Once You have exchanged Loyalty Points for a Reward, You are said to have “purchased” that Reward. After purchasing Your Reward, You will have a limited period of time in which complete a “redemption process” by following a defined “redemption method.” Redeeming a reward that has been purchased in the Service secures that reward for your specific use at a particular time. When the redemption process is complete, You may then “use” the reward. A Reward is considered “used” at the moment when it is consumed, e.g., when You check into a hotel room, eat a meal, or attend a show.
Partners may, at their discretion, place restrictions on the usage of the rewards they offer in the Service, e.g., a minimum age requirement, reward usage black-out dates, a limit as to the number and frequency of rewards that may be used within a specified period of time, and the requirement to participate in the partner’s own loyalty program, which may exists independently of the Service.  Redemption of Rewards are subject to the terms and provisions of the Rewards provider, including limitations on redeeming Rewards if you self-limit or self-exclude with the Reward provider or any regulatory agency, including any gaming regulatory agencies.
Because the Redemption Period, redemption method, and other terms of Rewards usage may vary, You must review the specific terms and conditions of each Reward You purchase with Your Loyalty Points. PLAYSTUDIOS is not responsible for the terms and conditions of the Rewards and bears no responsibility to You for any such unread, misread or misunderstood terms. The selection and availability of Rewards is subject to change without notice and PLAYSTUDIOS makes no guarantees as to the availability of any Reward. For complete details and the terms, conditions and restrictions for any individual reward, please refer to the rewards detail found within the Rewards catalog within the Service.
Reward Cancellations and Refunds
Generally, You may cancel, during the Redemption Period and for a full refund of the Loyalty Points used to purchase it, any Reward that You have purchased but not yet redeemed. Once You have redeemed a Reward, either through the online reservation system available through the Service or otherwise, You may no longer cancel that Reward and You will not receive a refund of Your Loyalty Points. On rare occasions, a Reward will “sell out” or otherwise become unavailable between the time You purchase it and the time You redeem it. If You are, within the Redemption Period, unable to redeem a purchased Reward because of such unavailability, You will be eligible to receive a full refund of the Loyalty Points used to purchase that Reward. If You do not redeem or cancel a Reward during that Reward’s Redemption Period, the Reward will expire. Your Loyalty Points will not be refunded to You if You allow a purchased Reward to expire. Some Rewards are of such limited availability that our Rewards Partners may, in their sole discretion, deem them to be non-refundable. Non-refundable Rewards do not have a Redemption Period and therefore may not be cancelled for a refund of Loyalty Points after they are purchased. You are solely responsible for reading and understanding the refund terms and conditions of each Reward You purchase.
Changes and Other Rewards Terms
You must be 21 years of age or older at time of redemption of Rewards offered by MGM Resorts and certain other Rewards Partners. Additionally, you must enroll in the M life program before or during redemption in order to redeem MGM Resorts International Rewards. The M life enrollment process is run by MGM Resorts International and may require you to provide MGM Resorts International with information such as your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. If you choose not to enroll in M life after purchasing a MGM Resorts International Reward, and you are still within the Redemption Period, you may cancel the Reward purchase and receive a full refund of your Loyalty Points. Once You have redeemed a MGM Resorts International Reward by making a reservation with MGM Resorts International, Your ability to change that reservation will be at the sole discretion of MGM Resorts International. Any such changes will not result in a change to Your Loyalty Points balance.
From time to time, other Rewards Partners may require You to enroll in separate rewards programs as a condition of redeeming certain Rewards.  If you choose to participate in such programs, You hereby agree to comply with all applicable Reward Partner rules, policies, and  terms and conditions.  Once You have redeemed a Reward with any such Rewards Partner, Your ability to change that Reward may be at the sole discretion of that Rewards Partner. Any such changes will not result in a change to Your Loyalty Points balance.
Rewards have no cash value and are non-transferable. You may not sell, trade, barter, bequeath or in any way transfer any Reward to any other party. Any attempt to do so will invalidate the Reward and may result in the termination of Your Account.
Inactive Accounts
If You do not use your Account by logging in using the Service at least once every 30 days, Your Account will be deemed inactive. You can, at any time, reactivate Your Account by logging in and using the Service. When an Account has been deemed inactive, PLAYSTUDIOS may, at its own discretion, expire any Loyalty Points accumulated by You.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
Purpose
This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision (this “Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and PLAYSTUDIOS. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury. Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and PLAYSTUDIOS (as defined below, for this Provision) shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys’ fees). For the purpose of this Provision, “PLAYSTUDIOS” means PLAYSTUDIOS and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and PLAYSTUDIOS regarding any aspect of your relationship with PLAYSTUDIOS, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. YOU AND PLAYSTUDIOS EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution
For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give PLAYSTUDIOS an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to PLAYSTUDIOS Legal Department, 10300 W. Charleston, Suite 13272, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If PLAYSTUDIOS does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out
Notwithstanding the above, you or PLAYSTUDIOS may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to PLAYSTUDIOS Legal Department, 10300 W. Charleston, Suite 13272, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with PLAYSTUDIOS through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with PLAYSTUDIOS. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures
If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or PLAYSTUDIOS may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
Arbitration Award—The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Location of Arbitration – You or PLAYSTUDIOS may initiate arbitration in either Las Vegas, Nevada or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution, PLAYSTUDIOS may transfer the arbitration to Las Vegas, Nevada in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.
Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – PLAYSTUDIOS will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with PLAYSTUDIOS as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
Class Action Waiver
Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and PLAYSTUDIOS specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
Jury Waiver
You understand and agree that by entering into this agreement you and PLAYSTUDIOS are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and PLAYSTUDIOS might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.
Severability
If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
Continuation
This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with PLAYSTUDIOS.
