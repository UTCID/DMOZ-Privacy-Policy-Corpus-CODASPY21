Lotwatch currently searches the following UK sites:
EBAY Auctions

the 100 most relevant.
More sites will be added to the above list to further enhance the users searching experience.

Are the results live?
YES! Lotwatch displays live results as they develop from each of the auction sites. We do
however recommend that you confirm the details displayed by Lotwatch if you are intending to bid for an item.
In some instances we cache very popular searches to reduce bandwidth and CPU usage - this should not
effect the results as any changes to a search will mean new results are posted.

How accurate are the results?
The results are 100% accurate but do rely heavily on the auction sites searched and the seller
of a particular lot. It is for this reason that Lotwatch strongly suggests that prior to bidding you compare the results
displayed by Lotwatch against those displayed by the auction site in question.

How do I get better results?
To get the best results from Lotwatch when searching you should follow the following basic guidelines:
Use a wide search criteria e.g. try searching for digital camera instead of Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera
Check your spelling - this is the most common reason for poor results
Use various Keywords e.g. try television instead of tv
Avoid punctuation and symbols which will tend to give poor results
To get the widest possible results you should select all the auction sites

Why do some eBay results show two prices?
When searching for auction lots you may notice that on some
of the eBay results two prices are shown. This is to reflect eBay auctions with a 'Buy
It Now' option. The price displayed at the top is the current bid price and the second price
is the 'Buy It Now' price.
You may also notice that for eBay results the number of bids is now shown as '?' this
is in line with the eBay's recent changes in the way the results are formatted. Please click
on the lot to show the current bid status.

What if I am not registered with an auction site?
As a matter of policy all the auction sites require users to be registered before bids can be placed or
items auctioned. Therefore if you haven't registered with a particular auction site and you want to bid on a lot you will be
prevented from doing so. To take the hassle out of registering with the auction sites we have created links to the registration
pages of the auctions that we search - this can be found on the tools page of this site or by Clicking Here

Increasing Timeout?
Occasionally you may find displayed at the bottom of the results page a message which states:
(name of auction) Timed out. This can be caused by various reasons including heavy network traffic, heavy
auction site traffic or slow response times from your ISP. To alleviate this problem you can increase the timeout setting
which will allow our system a longer response time. This setting will return to its default setting when you return to the
site or you can undo the changes yourself.

Search Problems?
Having problems searching?
Q. Why does it not bring back 1000's of results for a popular search word?
A. Lotwatch is a MetaSearch Engine which currently gathers the FIRST PAGE of results
from 9 UK Online Auction sites - these are the most relevant results according to the
auction sites. It would be pointless bringing back more results because:
a) This would increase the time a search took
b) The results returned would be less relevant
c) It would increase our bandwidth usage ;-(
d) Users would never read all the returned results
Q. Why only the first page of results per auction site?
A. Because these results are the most relevant, it also allows for a faster
search as Lotwatch searches the 9 sites simultaneously and
does so Live - it does not search a downloaded database.
Q. Why does a particular auction sometimes time out?
A. If an auction site is experiencing a lot of traffic when our spider visits
it sometimes results in a time out as our spider leaves before the server
passes the information over. You can increase the time out settings which
should resolve this problem as it will allow the server more time to pass over
the results.
