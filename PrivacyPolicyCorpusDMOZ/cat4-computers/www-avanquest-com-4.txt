Respecting your Privacy
Are you concerned about your privacy? Doing business together requires some sharing of information. Set out below is our Privacy Policy, explaining what information we collect and why, what we do with it and how we protect you.What information we collect and whyRegistration, download and purchase
To access certain areas of the Avanquest.com website (especially to download or to buy), you will first be asked to complete a form to either download a trial version, a free software title, or to create an account before buying any of our products.Registration
During registration, you may be required to provide your contact information, such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information and to choose a password.
Your email addresse is your username. We send all new registered visitors and clients a welcoming email to verify their password and username.
It’s very important that you submit a working email address because that that is where we’ll send your purchase confirmation, download links, activation keys, support and product notices. When an email address is not working, the associated password might be deactivated by Avanquest.Purchase
When buying a product on the site, you will be asked for your contact details and billing and shipping information. This data will be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card verification process, and to ship the item(s) you ordered. If there is a problem with the order, an Avanquest representative may contact you by email, phone, fax or post. A confirmation email is sent for each purchase to the address you give us - so if you have a few addresses take a moment to remember which one you give us.Download
When downloading a trial version or a free software programme, you will be asked for contact information, including your email address. You will receive email messages related to this transaction such as to provide you with download links, activation keys, support notices and upgrades for the software.
Surveys and contests
From time to time, we request information from Avanquest.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. This information is mainly used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal information will be divulged without the explicit consent of the winners.“Send to a Friend” Service.
To use our “Send to a friend” services, you are requested to provide additional names and email addresses. For these “Send to a friend” services, Avanquest.com sends an email on your behalf containing links to the information you have selected on the Avanquest.com website – and only in that specific context. None of these email addresses are reused later, unless their owner subscribes by themselves to our services. What we do with itYour subscription to Avanquest News and Special Offers
When submitting your email address, you are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to the Avanquest newsletter.  By opting to receive this communication, Avanquest will send you regular emails containing relevant product and service information, new product and upgrade information, and any special offers that we think may be relevant to you.If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter
