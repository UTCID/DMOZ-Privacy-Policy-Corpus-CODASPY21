when transferring and receiving any data that you exchange with our site. We
employ the same industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology that is
used by major banks and stock brokerage firms to conduct business via the
Internet. This encryption procedure "scrambles" the information you
send us and makes online transactions extremely safe.
Sensitive information, such as financial information, will
only be collected through secure web pages. Most browsers will display a green
"padlock" icon indicating you are browsing on a secure page.
We
have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to
protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have
collected from you via this site.
