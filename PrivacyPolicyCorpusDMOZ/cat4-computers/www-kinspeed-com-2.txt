We are registered in England and Wales under company number 01949563 and with our registered office at Albion House Ravenshorn Way, Renishaw, Derbyshire, S12 3XW which is also our main trading address. Our VAT number is 438 9552 09.YOUR STATUSBy placing an order with us, you warrant that:You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts.You are at least 18 years old.All details you provide to us for the purpose of ordering or purchasing goods are true, accurate, current and complete in all respects.You are authorised to use the credit or debit card with which you purchase any Product(s) and that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover payment of the Product(s) ordered.HOW THE CONTRACT IS FORMED BETWEEN YOU AND USAfter placing an order with us, you will receive an initial e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order and a further email will usually be sent (usually within 48 hours of the initial e-mail) advising an estimated delivery date for the Product(s).Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order (whether made through our site or over the telephone or fax or in writing) constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us and product availability, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Product has been dispatched (the “Dispatch Confirmation”). The contract between us (the “Contract”) will only be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation.The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation.When placing an order, you warrant that any and all information and/or specifications given are complete and accurate.All specifications, descriptions, colours or illustrations of Products on our site are given for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Products sold through our site and we shall not be liable for any variations in any specification, description or colour of the Product which do not materially affect the specification, use and operation of the Product.We reserve the right to refuse your order for any reason.Any quotation is valid for a period of 30 days only from its date, provided that we have not previously withdrawn it. Any quotation is given on the basis that no Contract shall come into existence until we send you a dispatch confirmation in accordance with condition 2.1.AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERYYour order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Dispatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within a reasonable time of the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Where we become aware that the date for delivery may be delayed, we will notify you as soon as possible and aim to provide you with a revised date. Delivery of Products will usually be made directly from the manufacturer or supplier.If you order more than one Product, the Products may be delivered to you in separate instalments. Each instalment is a separate Contract and no cancellation of one Contract relating to an instalment entitles you to cancel any other Contract or instalment.All deliveries require a signature. Deliveries will be made to the “kerb-side”, ground floor of a delivery address only. You agree to provide (at your expense) adequate and appropriate manual labour for unloading the Product(s). If the delivery address is not accessible by lorry you must inform us by telephone or email at the time of order.You must inspect all Products thoroughly before signing for delivery. If items are defective or damaged on delivery, you must inform us in accordance with Condition 8.3.If you fail to take delivery of the Product(s) or we are unable to deliver the Product(s) on time because you have not provided adequate delivery instructions, the Product(s) shall be returned to the supplier or manufacturer and a further delivery date will be arranged. You agree to meet the costs of any subsequent re-delivery.We shall not be liable for any loss you incur, whether financial or otherwise, resulting directly or indirectly from our delay or failure to meet the date where the delay is caused by reasons outside of our control.We shall not be liable for any non-delivery of Products unless you give written notice to us of the non-delivery within 3 days of the date when the Product(s) would in the ordinary course of events have been received. Our liability for non-delivery of Products shall be limited to replacing the Product(s) within a reasonable time.Delivery to a different address other than the cardholder’s address is at our discretion.RISK AND TITLEThe Products will be at your risk from the time of delivery.Ownership of the Product(s) will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including delivery charges.PRICE AND PAYMENTThe price of any Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Discounts for bulk purchases may be available on request.These prices are shown as both exclusive and inclusive of VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due. Please contact us for details of delivery charges to remote postal areas, overseas and to locations outside the United Kingdom mainland.Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation.Our site contains a large number of Product(s) and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Product(s) listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product’s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product”s correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Dispatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.Payment for all Products must be by credit card, debit card or cheque. We accept payment by most major credit/debit cards including Visa, Mastercard, Switch, Delta, Maestro and Solo. We also accept online payments via Google Checkout or Protx. Where payment for Products is made by credit or debit cards issued outside the United Kingdom, such payment may be subject to an upper limit. Payment will be taken at the time of order. An order will not be despatched until full payment has been received in respect of that order.To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.CONSUMER RIGHTSIf you are contracting as a consumer, you may cancel a Contract at any time within seven working days, beginning on the day after you received the Products.
