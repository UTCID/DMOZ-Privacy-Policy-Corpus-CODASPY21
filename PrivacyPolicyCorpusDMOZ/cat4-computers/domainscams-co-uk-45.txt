Home: Consumer Law :
Sale of Goods Act 1979
Under the Act you are entitled to expect that any goods you buy from a trader are:
of satisfactory quality
fit for any particular purpose made known to the seller
as described.
Satisfactory quality means that the goods should meet the standard a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory taking into account the description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all other relevant circumstances. The quality of the goods applies to their state and condition including their appearance and finish, freedom from minor defects, and safety and durability. They should also be fit for all purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly supplied. Your rights under this Act are against the person who sold you the goods and not the manufacturer.
You have no real grounds for a complaint if you:
were told about the fault before you purchased the item;
examined the item when you bought it and should have seen the fault;
made a mistake when purchasing the item; or
simply changed your mind about the item.
Remedies
If you’ve bought something not of satisfactory quality, not fit for a particular purpose or not as described, the law gives you a number of remedies.
If you complain to the retailer within a reasonable time, you’re entitled to get a full refund. However, the law does not say what a reasonable time is. Each case may be different. So the sooner you make your complaint, the better.
Once you go beyond a reasonable time to reject the goods, you’re only entitled to claim compensation. You can also claim for any consequential losses that result directly from the goods being unsatisfactory.
Alternatively, you may wish to ask, in the first instance, for a repair or replacement.
Such repair or replacement has to be carried out within a reasonable time and without any great inconvenience to you. The retailer has to bear any costs, such as transporting the goods.
However, the retailer can refuse either of these remedies, if it can be shown that the other one would be less costly.
If a quick and trouble-free repair or replacement is not possible, you can ask for a full or part-refund. Whatever benefit you may have already had from the goods will be taken into account in deciding any refund.

Domain Name Facts - know the facts, avoid being scammed
International & UK domains are registered instantly - no other company is informed of the registration and no-one can intervene
International (.com .net .org) domains can be registered for 1 - 10 years, whereas UK (.co.uk .org.uk .ltd.uk .plc.uk .me.uk) domains are registered and renewed at 2 year intervals - it is not possible to register a UK domain for anything more or less than 2 years
Domain names can be registered cheaply, quickly and easily online, you do not necessarily need an agent to register for you
Companies that sell domain names by telesales are almost always scammers
A registration company is not obliged to check trademarks and company names before agreeing to register any domain - this is the registrant's responsibility
Owning a trademark or company name does not automatically entitle you to the matching domain names
It is not possible to "earmark" or reserve a domain name
DON'T send money to companies you've never heard of
