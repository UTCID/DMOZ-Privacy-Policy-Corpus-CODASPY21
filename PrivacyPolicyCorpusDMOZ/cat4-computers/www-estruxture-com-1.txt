This ‘new normal’ brings new challenges and securing data and preventing breaches is business critical. Partners like ITSS Canada Inc. help companies effectively manage their cybersecurity strategy and better understand their technology challenges and infrastructure needs, which is a must in this unprecedented time. Our pan-Canadian network of data centers boosts geo-redundancy and offers direct access to a robust ecosystem of network, applications and cloud service providers, which is of critical value for companies like ITSS,” says Todd Coleman, President and CEO of eStruxture Data Centers.Over the past months, many IT departments have allowed additional access to their corporate network, causing new exposures to organizations’ critical data as new methods of cyberthreats and ransomware attacks strike businesses.

The new FireTower SaaS-based tool set from ITSS Canada Inc. identifies vulnerabilities and breaches and provides an overall report on the health of a company’s digital presence.
