The information produced by the cookie regarding usage of our website is usually transferred to a server of Google in the United States of America and saved there. If anonymization of the IP address transmitted by the cookie is activated on the website (“IP Anonymization”), your IP address will be shortened by Google within the Member States of the European Un-ion or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances, will your full IP address be transferred to a server of Goo-gle in the United States of America and abbreviated there.
