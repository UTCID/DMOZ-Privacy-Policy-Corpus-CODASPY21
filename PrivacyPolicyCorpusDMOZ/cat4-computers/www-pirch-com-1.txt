Please read the PIRCH® Terms and Conditions in its entirety. Your order will be created after you have accepted them, at the bottom of the page.
Pirch Terms and Conditions
DEFINITIONS
Delivery and installation services may be performed by employees of
Pirch and/or in certain circumstances by third parties. In this
Agreement, we refer to installation personnel as “Professionals”.
AUTHORIZATION
By entering into this Agreement, You authorize Pirch to (a) arrange for
Professionals to perform installation services and/or (b) order and
arrange for the delivery of special order merchandise, including special
order merchandise that may be custom made, as specified in the
Agreement.
ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between You and
Pirch regarding the products and services specified in this Agreement
and may only be amended by a Change Order signed by You and Pirch. This
Agreement expressly supersedes all prior written or verbal agreements,
representations or warranties made by Pirch, Professionals, You, or
anyone else. Except as set forth in this Agreement, You agree there are
no oral or written agreements, representations, warranties or
inducements, express or implied, in any way conditioning this Agreement,
and You expressly disclaim their existence. By placing a deposit on Your
order, You acknowledge that You have read, understand, and accept this
Agreement in its entirety. You further acknowledge receiving a complete
copy of this Agreement. Keep it to protect Your legal rights.
CHANGES AND CHANGE ORDERS
Any changes to an installation, i.e., a substitution of material or an
expansion of the scope of the work, will require You and Pirch to sign a
Change Order that will become part of this Agreement. We may require You
to pay the additional cost caused by a Change Order at the time a Change
Order is agreed by You and Pirch.
ADDITIONAL CHARGES
For work that requires an additional charge, Professionals will provide
an estimate prior to the work, and a description of any permits or
additional parts or labor needed. Most additional charges are not known
until the Professional does an inspection of Your service address. Some
things can be hidden in the structure or behind appliances that cannot
be seen until work is underway. Delivery and installation more than 75
miles from a Pirch Showroom are subject to additional fees. Final tax
values will be recalculated at the time of order shipment.
PRICE POLICY & PAYMENT
Pirch will hold all product pricing for up to one (1) year on orders
where a minimum of fifty percent (50%) deposit has been made at the time
of order, and is maintained at all times throughout the fulfillment of
the order. Price hold expires 12 months from the date of deposit. Upon
expiration, products are subject to then current pricing. You agree to
pay Pirch according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Except for accounts that have been approved by Pirch for net payment
terms, all products must be paid in full no less than thirty (30) days
prior to the required delivery or installation date. Any payments not
made when due are subject to a late payment charge equal to 1.5% per
month or, if less, the maximum lawful interest rate permitted under
applicable law. Late payments may also result in product delays. You
agree to sole responsibility for vendor promotion or rebate redemptions.
Manufacturer rebates or promotions are subject to vendor guidelines.
RETURN POLICY
Pirch accepts returns or exchanges on closed box, unused merchandise
that has not been installed within thirty (30) days of Your receipt of
an item. Proof of purchase is required for a refund, credit or exchange.
Once returned, the item will be inspected, and exchanges, credits and
refunds will be issued for the purchase price only. If You return an
item bought as part of a bundle or with a promotional discount or free
item, your refund, credit or exchange may be reduced by the value of the
discount or free item. In the event of a return of items purchased in
connection with a promotional or reward card or mail-in rebate, all or a
portion of the card or rebate amount may be deducted from any refund,
credit or exchange. Any taxes charged will be refunded in accordance
with state and local laws. Pirch does not accept returns on installed
items unless the product arrived at the point of delivery damaged or the
damage was a result of Pirch's installation process.
Shipping and delivery charges are non-refundable except for product that
arrived at the point of delivery damaged or defective merchandise.
Installation fees are non-refundable after Pirch installation is completed.
REFUNDS
Refunds will be made in the same form as original purchase. Refunds on
purchases made by cash or check will be refunded by check mailed
approximately ten (10) business days after receipt of returned
merchandise. Refunds by credit card will be processed by Pirch within
five (5) business days. Your credit card merchant may take longer to
post the refund to Your account. Refunds on purchases made with a gift
card will be refunded via store credit.
RESTOCKING/HOLDING FEE
You will be charged a minimum 25% restocking fee on all regular stock
returns. Once product has been shipped by the vendor, it is subject to
refund/restocking policy. Returns on special order items are limited to
transit damage or manufacturer defect only. Special order returns due to
customer preference, no-fits or any other reason will not be accepted.
Pirch does not accept returns on special orders or custom products.
Where all conditions for returning or exchanging a purchase are not met
(e.g., You do not have original packaging or accessories or do not have Your
receipt or packing slip), Pirch may, in its discretion, permit the return or
exchange of the purchase subject to a minimum restocking charge of 25% of
the purchase price (unless prohibited by law).
We would be happy to hold Your product for 30 days from the time we received
all products for the scheduled phase of Your job. For inventory storage
beyond 30 days, a monthly holding fee of $150 or 5%, whichever is greater,
will be assessed.
CUSTOM ORDERS
Custom orders begin production immediately upon order and are built to
Your specifications. They cannot be cancelled, changed, returned or
refunded at any time. A non-refundable 100% deposit will be taken when
the order is placed.
RESCHEDULES/REVISIT FEE
In the event that You or Your contractor, designer or other
representative confirms a delivery or install date and the job site is
not ready, is unsafe or no one will be present at the designated time,
and Pirch or Professionals are not notified of the need to reschedule at
least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, You will be charged a
revisit/reschedule fee of $179. To ensure the health and safety of our
employees and service providers, we reserve the right to refuse or
reschedule work due to unsafe conditions, which may include, without
limitation, extreme temperatures, extreme weather conditions, natural
disasters, infestation, or the existence of other hazards.
CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES
If Your service address is subject to any easements, covenants, or other
legal encumbrances that could affect installation, You agree to let
Pirch or Professional know about them before installation. You agree to
facilitate the location of utility lines. You are responsible for
identifying property lines. You agree to ensure that work areas are free
of preexisting physical or environmental hazards, and building/zoning
code violations. You agree to provide Professionals access to work areas
during working hours and provide access to sanitary facilities or pay
the facilities' rental costs. You agree to ensure any security system
You have will not interfere with installation. You agree to provide
power to, and, as applicable, climate control in, work areas. You agree
not to allow unattended minors at Your service address while
Professional is present. You agree to control and keep pets away from
work areas. You agree to keep posted permits on display at all times.
You agree to pay any transportation/storage charges or other resulting
charges. YOU ASSUME THE RISK AND THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF PHYSICALLY
ASSISTING WITH DELIVERY OF MATERIALS OR WITH INSTALLATION.
PERMITS
Depending upon Your location, permits may be required for the
installation. If Permits are required, You are responsible to obtain and
pay for such permits. If agreed by You and Pirch, Professional may
obtain any necessary permits, but You are responsible for the cost of
such permits.
RESCISSION RIGHT
You have the right to cancel this transaction in its entirety without
any penalty or obligation, within three (3) business days. You may
cancel by emailing, mailing, faxing, or personally delivering a written
notice to Pirch at the store address specified on the Invoice by
midnight of the third business day after You received a signed and dated
copy of this Agreement that includes this notice. Include Your name,
Your address, and the date You received the signed copy of this
Agreement, and the Invoice number, and refer to this notice.
TERMINATION FOR BREACH
You may terminate this Agreement if Pirch breaches this Agreement and
fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after You provide
Pirch written notice of the breach. If You breach this Agreement and
fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days (or five (5) days for
failure to pay on time) after notice of the breach, or if You decline a
reasonable Change Order request, Pirch may immediately terminate the
Agreement without further obligation to You. In the event of
termination, You agree to pay Pirch the costs of merchandise, materials,
labor, and other services provided by Pirch and/or Professional through
the date of termination, plus any other amounts specified in this
Agreement or allowed under applicable law.

ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME
