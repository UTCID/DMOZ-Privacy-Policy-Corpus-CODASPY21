<p class="has-normal-font-size">TikTok, just like Instagram a few years ago, is experiencing
a huge boom in terms of active users and popularity. The app has more than 1
billion monthly active users and it is one of the most popular downloaded
applications in the App Store. Such figures are astonishing, especially
considering that the app has been around for less than 2 years. Tik Tok&#8217;s user
base is also projected to grow in the next years.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">If you have a smartphone or if you live with teenagers or
just like to keep up with technology, chances are you have already heard of
TikTok. In case you are not familiar with this social media app, you should at
least know that it is an application where users share short funny clips that
easily go viral. It is the potential for virality that made the app extremely
popular. Similar to Vine, the content shared on this platform varies greatly:
from make-up tutorials to world-history reenacting, TikTok offers content for
different users, predominantly teenagers.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">However, lately, TikTok has been criticized by the US senators for censorship, privacy and for concerns about child safety. Are the concerns real? What should you know about the privacy issues related to Tik Tok? Should you be worried? If you want to find some solid answers to such questions, keep reading this article.</p>
<h3> What Is TikTok and Why Is It So Popular? </h3>
<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="376" class="wp-image-61" align="right" style="width: 300px;" src="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tiktok_body_sm.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tiktok_body_sm.jpg 600w, https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tiktok_body_sm-480x301.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" />TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance and its story is rather complicated. The TikTok was born out of an acquisition by the Chinese startup of Musical.ly, a rather popular app in the US and the Western world, but that had originally nothing to do with social media. ByteDance took the idea of the original app and innovate it to create the concept of what is now known as TikTok. Today, the Chinese startup is one of the most valuable companies in the world, rated at 75 billion dollars.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">In terms of downloading, Tiktok has beaten Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. What seemed to make it popular is the spontaneity of the short clips, that allow users to goof around for a while, as opposed to Instagram, where the people have started to feel the pressure of having to post perfect pictures and amazing content. Videos are shared instantly and can quickly reach millions of users and go viral in a matter of minutes. The user base of TikTok is a lot younger than the average of the rest of the competitors, with the majority of users being less than 18 years old.</p>
<h3> TikTok Privacy Issues </h3>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">It is the younger user base that has brought TikTok into trouble. February of this year saw Tik Tok having to face accusation for child-privacy US laws violation. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has opened an investigation against TikTok and its privacy policy and some issues have emerged. The company has mainly been accused to share user data with the Chinese Government. That is due to a Chinese law created in 2017 requiring companies operating in the country to cooperate on national intelligence. Some even argue that the app is susceptible to censorship by the Chinese government. While the company refuses to admit the truthfulness of such accusations, the senate is urging US citizens to be careful about the content and personal data shared in this platform.The Response From The Company and Further Investigations </p>
<h3> The Response From The Company and Further Investigations </h3>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">TikTok proactively responded to such accusations and tried
to improve its position and its privacy policy in order not to lose important
users and popularity. Indeed, to boost transparency, the social media app has
recently launched a content moderation center. The center is designed to
provide relevant information on the source code, the internal instructions of
the software and to offer better details on privacy and security. All this to
improve its efforts in terms of protection of users&#8217; data.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">The company is also looking for a new CEO to run TikTok in the US, to distance itself from the Chinese government, in an attempt to loosen up the worries of the US senate. How innocuous is the app in reality? How can we know whether the Chinese government is indeed surveilling the millions of teenagers using the app daily?</p>
<h3>Content Removal and Data Breach</h3>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Many users have noticed a rather common trend in terms of
content removals. Some of the most obvious ones include videos concerning Hong
Kong protests. However, the company states that such removals have nothing to
do with requirements by the Chinese governments. The fault might be of poorly
trained moderators, but the US Senate does not seem to buy that idea. Tik Tok
claims to handle moderation separately for different regions, meaning that
censorship by the Chinese government would not affect US users, for instance.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">The biggest fear related to the access of US users&#8217; data by
the Chinese government is the creation of an accurate picture of people&#8217;s lives
and habits, which would create incredible opportunities to blackmail and to use
such information for making incredible amounts of income. This is why, for the
moment, the US Department of Defense is encouraging its employees to avoid
installing the app on their smartphones. Indeed, some investigation found out
that the application can collect not only location and images but also
biometric data. Because of Chinese law, the company cannot refuse to share data
with the Chinese government upon request.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">The security research firm Checkpoint has discovered some of
the main weak points in terms of data security in TikTok. However, the same
company also going out that TikTok has developed an update recently to fix such
weaknesses which would allow attackers to compromise accounts.</p>
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Similar breaches of personal data have been experienced by Instagram and Facebook users as well, meaning that the threats to security and privacy that social media pose to users are not limited to TikTok. However, it is not an exaggeration to say that TikTok might pose greater threats due to the probable influence of the Chinese government on the app&#8217;s operations.</p>

<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">The launch of the iPhone X brought along with it a revolutionary unlock feature, known to many as the facial recognition scanner. With the Face ID, the iPhone X users can unlock their phones by utilizing its front camera to scan their unique facial features. This is a step up from the fingerprint sensor. While it does sound convenient for the users to unlock their phones, there have been some concerns especially voiced by privacy experts regarding the protection of privacy that the device itself provides. Of course, the Face ID prevents people from accessing your phone, but is the data of your facial features protected from going out from your device and falling into the wrong hands? Here, we will take a closer look at the storage of the data of your facial scan, as well as how Apple handles it in its latest smartphone.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before
we even get into the issue, we should address whether the Face ID does provide adequate protection in the
first place. Apple claims that the Face ID is secure, as it should be, and that
touting internal data shows a very low chance (one in a million) that the phone
will unlock with a different person’s face. To unlock the phone, the device
stores the user’s face scan inside on a secure enclave<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. That
means your facial data remains inside the device. However, one cannot dismiss
the possibility that app developers can, albeit limited, access that data. </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" width="393" height="599" class="wp-image-48" style="width: 150px;" align="right" src="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/393px-IPhone_X_dots_projection_for_Face_ID_224631.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/393px-IPhone_X_dots_projection_for_Face_ID_224631.jpg 393w, https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/393px-IPhone_X_dots_projection_for_Face_ID_224631-197x300.jpg 197w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" />Here, some technology commentators are worried about who can have access to the sensor. One potential use of the sensor for advertisers, according to Geoffrey Fowler in his review for the Washington Post, is the fact that they can use the camera to determine exactly where the user is looking on the screen during their advertisements if you are looking at them at all. He also mentioned that Apple’s terms for app developers forbid them from accessing the camera without permission or use the face data for advertising. Moreover, Fowler pressed the Apple executives and saw one positive change: applications that use the face data are required to publish a privacy policy. However, how well that protects the user’s privacy remains to be seen. </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple actually allows app developers to take certain
facial data from the phone and store it on the developer’s own server, as long
as they ask the user for their permission, and not sell that data to third
parties. Although the data access is limited, the app developers can capture a
rough map of the user’s face and numerous expressions. That means the app
developers can and will know when you smile, blink, or raise an eyebrow.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">According
to the documentation about the face unlock system which Apple released to
security researchers, the data of the user’s face that is accessible to the
developers cannot be used to unlock a phone. To unlock the phone, a
mathematical representation of the face is required as opposed to the
requirement of a visual map of the face<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>. At least,
that means app developers cannot remotely unlock your phone and access your
data. Still, the fact that the authentication data can be shared does not sit
well with everyone.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where privacy protection becomes really questionable. By enabling app developers to store the user’s rough facial data on their own server, just how well can Apple enforce their privacy protection rule upon those developers? After all, advertisers need the facial data to tell whether their advertisements are effective, or to simply study their target audience. </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Apple remains firm that they are sure that their enforcement tools, which are pre-publication reviews, audits of applications, and the threat of removing the app from the app store, are effective. The problem here is that Apple does not thoroughly review the source code of the applications, according to the 2011 Congressional testimony from Bud Trible. Moreover, Apple relies instead on random spot checks or complaints, which is a very ineffective means of defense against privacy abuse. When it comes to privacy policies published by the application developer, it is long and complex, and it will most likely not be read by the users. </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Another
means of enforcement is the threat of kicking apps out of the App Store. While
it is true that Apple has a good record
of holding developers accountable for their violations, the challenge here is
the fact that Apple has to find them first, according to American Civil
Liberties Union’s Stanley. While these enforcement rules may seem strong on
paper, in actuality, small application developers will most likely follow
Apple’s rules. Still, larger companies like Uber, have a record of breaking
Apple’s rules<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>. That
brings Apple’s enforcement mechanism into question.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All-in-all,
the introduction of the Face ID
authentication system is, without a doubt, revolutionary in the race to
smartphone supremacy. However, one should not dismiss the security flaws
offered by new, and flashy technologies. Here, the user’s privacy may not be as
protected as they think. While Apple does have its defense mechanisms against
privacy violations from application developers, their effectiveness remains to
be seen.<br></p>

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technique of accessing the internet through a private network and not the typical ISP.

This method was initially used by businesses that wanted to share information [&#8230;]
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technique of accessing the internet through a private network and not the typical ISP. The VPN encrypts all the information it receives from your computer, phone or tablet such that no one else can access it. This method was initially used by businesses that wanted to share information and data with employees even when they were at home or abroad. Employees could still log in to the networks, access data, share and work on projects just as they would have done if they were in the office.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Nowadays, the VPN service is being used more for private reasons than to share data. The ease of the exchange of information and conducting transactions online has more people choosing to operate online than offline. You can make payments, close deals and pursue leads from the comfort of your phone or tablet from anywhere in the world. You no longer need to meet people face to face to conduct business.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">The ease that comes with online transactions has seen more people resulting in using public networks in cyber cafes, restaurants, and airports. It is possible to transact business but how safe is it from hackers. If you want to secure your connections, then a VPN should be your ideal choice. The VPN service provider gives you a new IP address and encrypts data so that no one can access any of your online activities. What are the benefits?</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Security</strong></h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">It is estimated that cybercrime has risen from zero to over 125% in 2015 and no one is safe. The 2017 attack on Gmail where logging details for over a million accounts were collected just shows how smart attackers have become. To secure your information, you need to use a VPN. Only you and the VPN provider can access the information. Some governments require VPN providers to store log information for all their clients, therefore, the need to choose a VPN that does not store data such as those found in the USA. When using public networks, make sure a VPN protects you. </p>
<h3><strong>Privacy</strong></h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">You can use the internet without worrying about someone checking what you have been up to. If you want to download from your computer at work, a VPN will ensure that no one can retrace your online footsteps. Also, your passwords, details, and information are secure. When you want to make purchases or send sensitive information, you are assured that no one else can access it. Since the VPN gives you a different IP address, it will be hard to detect your location. You can be in South Africa, yet the VPN address indicates that you are located somewhere in UK or any other place of choice. The data is encrypted meaning that no one can read it.</p>
<h3><strong>No More Online Barriers</strong></h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Some websites are only accessible to specified countries. If you want to check them out or get a hold of channels that you would otherwise not access from your country, a VPN can benefit you. It gives you an IP address in the desired country. This enables you to access the internet as if you are located there.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">On the same note, some countries limit internet access to some websites. When you visit these countries, you want to be able to browse just as you used to in your mother country. For instance, China limits access to Facebook, Twitter YouTube among other sites. A VPN will help you disguise your IP address when you visit the country enabling you to access the restricted sites. Locals in China also use VPN to access the same sites.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Business owners can also benefit from using a VPN, especially when communicating with clients. When they have to move from one country to another, they can still maintain the VPN of their business location. This means that all emails and correspondence to the clients will be from one central location address. </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">Customers can raise eyebrows, and some even avoid transacting with you when they notice the different places you operate from. They may think that you might not be available when they need you. Getting a VPN is quite important when communicating with new clients or prospects.</p>

aid: '727579.6c8ae9'
});</script><div id="rfsn_img_54200"></div>
<p>
<h3><strong>More Productivity</strong></h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size"> Companies offer their employees VPN providers to enable them to access information even when they are at home or away for holiday and business. It allows employees to carry on with work even after they have left the office. Students can also access information while away from school.
The free VPN provided for by a company can also be used for security purposes when accessing public networks such as airport WIFI. <br> </p>
<h3><strong>Clients Can Trust You More</strong> </h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">
Because of the many cyber-attacks, customers might hesitate before they give you their details. You can assure them of the security measures you have put in place such as using a VPN provider to secure their data. The recent attacks on the IRS system have left many worried about the safety of their information. </p>
<h3><strong>It is Affordable</strong></h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size">
When you consider all the benefits you get when using a VPN, putting aside about $10 every month will be a worthy investment. There are free VPN providers, but the downside to using them is they make accessing the internet slower. This is because of having too many users accessing the system. Also, they display ads on your browser and can have a limited number of servers you can choose from. If you are new to VPN providers, you can choose the free versions, have a feel of how things work then upgrade.</p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size"> You risk a lot when you do not protect your information online. Hackers are always on the lookout to find any vulnerable victims they can take advantage of. Do not be on the receiving side. Protect yourself with an affordable yet dependable VPN. You will be more comfortable accessing the internet from public networks. At the same time, you will be able to work at ease knowing that no one is looking over your shoulder. </p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px" class="has-text-color">We recommend Virtual Shield for a VPN.

<h3>The Developing Story</h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color">Apple Inc. is now facing yet another conflict with the U.S. federal government as the latter stated that it would force the company to open an iPhone involved in a recent New York drug case. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the government continues to require the assistance of Apple in accessing the data that is authorized by a search warrant.<br>
In line with this ongoing issue, Apple issued a statement through one of their legal counsels, saying that although disappointed, the company is not surprised by this movement, following what happened a few months ago after they stood firm to their decision not to unlock an iPhone used by one of the two terrorists in an attack in San Bernardino, California, where 14 people were gunned down at a party last December. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified one of the gunmen as Syed Farook who was then using an iPhone 5C. This phone was particularly important to the FBI because it may hold pieces of information that will help them solve the case.</p>
<h3> Opposing Points of View </h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color has-text-align-left"><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" align="right" class="wp-image-15" style="width: 340px;" src="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iPhone-privacy.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iPhone-privacy.jpg 460w, https://www.privacyguard.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iPhone-privacy-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" />Apple refused to unlock the phone even under the orders of the U.S. Magistrate Sheri Pym to build a custom version of its iOS software that will run only on this specific iPhone. The company’s chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook argued that the order had gone too far and that bypassing the password means creating a “back door” in its operating system that could be used to unlock hundreds of millions of iPhones, thus undermining the security and privacy of its users.<br> The company stated that it is “certainly possible to create an entirely new operating system to undermine our features as the government wants” but Apple’s point was they cannot just circumvent the protection of this single phone and expect other phones to stay safe and secure from all kinds of security breaches. According to Cook, this order is equivalent to a master key, capable of opening a countless number of locks all around the world.<br> </p>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color">However, the FBI stood strong in saying that what they are requiring Apple to do is a way of fighting terrorists who are now using modern means of communication and technology to wreak havoc and cause chaos. They also stated that this order is a reasonable one so they may gain evidence but Apple would not cave in because all the company cared about was their business model and brand.<br> With regards to the custom iOS version being requested, the government filed on February 19 that, “Apple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple, and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders.”<br> Despite this statement, Apple executives believed that once this version is created, it would appear like appealing eye candy for hackers. And they would not risk putting their servers in jeopardy because once a technique is produced in the digital world; it could be used countless times on all kinds of devices. In addition, if ever they comply with the orders of the FBI, the company saw this as a “dangerous precedent” wherein the government might resort to asking this in the future to bypass any security feature that keeps law enforcement from accessing the latest iPhone model.<br> In March, the FBI dropped its request for Apple to crack the iPhone used by Farook, saying they had found alternate methods to unlock the phone without the help of the company.</p>
<h3>The New York Case</h3>
<p style="color:#000000" class="has-text-color">This drug case in New York involves another iPhone, belonging to a man identified as Jun Feng, that according to reports is much easier for Apple to break into. The DOJ is hoping that Apple will cooperate this time to unlock the phone so they may locate accomplices since they acknowledged that it could extract data from the phone without having to create custom software.<br>
This persisting battle involves more than just iPhones. And while this issue still sparks debates and arguments, the question left unanswered is “How will Apple and the government see eye to eye?”</p>
