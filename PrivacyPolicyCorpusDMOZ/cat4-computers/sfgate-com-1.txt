The United States Department of Justice sent a strongly-worded letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Friday, warning of "further action" if current restrictions on places of worship amid the coronavirus pandemic are not lifted.
Under the city's current health order, only one congregant at a time is allowed to worship indoors. Even though San Francisco is permitted to allow 25% capacity at indoor places of worship under its status as a red tier county, local officials have taken a stricter approach.
In a letter signed by assistant attorney general Eric S. Dreiband and attorney for the Northern District of California David Anderson, the DOJ called the city's restrictions "draconian, out of step with the treatment afforded other similar indoor activities in San Francisco, wholly at odds with this Nation’s traditional understanding of religious liberty, and may violate the First Amendment to the Constitution."
The DOJ cites a recent concurrence from Chief Justice John Roberts in a denial of application for a church-related case, in which Roberts writes that emergency pandemic-related restrictions on religious activities are constitutionally permissible so long as the restrictions "apply to comparable secular gatherings."
"The Health Order provides more favorable treatment to a range of secular activities including activities that typically feature similar or greater degrees of personal contact as religious gatherings," the DOJ attorneys write to Breed. "Personal service providers including barber shops, nail salons, massage locations, and tattoo parlors — where there is significant contact between the service provider and the customer over an extended period of time — are permitted to serve as many customers indoors as they can space at six feet apart. Gyms and fitness centers are permitted to serve '10% of the facility’s normal maximum occupancy or . . . the number of people who can maintain at least six feet of physical distance from each other in the facility at all times.'"

In a statement released Friday, city attorney Dennis Herrera defended the approach taken by local health officials.
"We must be doing something right," Herrera said. "Meanwhile, more than 200,000 Americans are dead from this virus. Maybe the federal government should focus on an actual pandemic response instead of lobbing careless legal threats. San Francisco is opening up at the speed of safety. Religious gatherings indoors and outdoors are already set to expand in a few days. This expansion is beyond what is described in the federal government’s letter. It's consistent with San Francisco’s careful approach and follows closely behind what the State of California allows."
