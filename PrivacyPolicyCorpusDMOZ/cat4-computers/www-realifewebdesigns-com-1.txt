Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to ReaLifeWebDesigns.com:
We don't ask you for personal information unless we
need it.
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's visitors use its website. From time to time, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
ReaLifeWebDesigns.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
ReaLifeWebDesigns.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to discourage spammers.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's website choose to interact with ReaLifeWebDesigns.com in ways that require ReaLifeWebDesigns.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ReaLifeWebDesigns.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with ReaLifeWebDesigns.com are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with ReaLifeWebDesigns.com. ReaLifeWebDesigns.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
ReaLifeWebDesigns.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com may monitor the most popular accounts. ReaLifeWebDesigns.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
ReaLifeWebDesigns.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's behalf or to provide services available at ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ReaLifeWebDesigns.com's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ReaLifeWebDesigns.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ReaLifeWebDesigns.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ReaLifeWebDesigns.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a ReaLifeWebDesigns.com website and have supplied your email address, ReaLifeWebDesigns.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ReaLifeWebDesigns.com and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ReaLifeWebDesigns.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
