MetroFax Service Description.The Company offers the Service at its website
www.MetroFax.com
(together with other websites owned and operated by the Company, the "MetroFax
Website").
The Service includes, but is not limited to: (i) a personal geographical or toll-free telephone number (a
"MetroFax Number") that provides for the delivery of faxes to email, the MetroFax Website or applications
provided by the Company; and (ii) outbound faxing from email, the MetroFax Website or applications provided
by the Company.Back to top
Service Usage Terms.(a) Usage terms for the Service are as follows:(1) If you registered for the Service on or after December 1, 2013:Unless you registered for a different plan on the MetroFax website or by phone with a Sales Representative,
you may send and/or receive up to 500 fax pages within any thirty (30) day period, regardless of whether
you are issued a local or a toll-free MetroFax Number. Faxes sent or received in excess of the 500 page
limit are charged at $0.03 per page (which amount may vary outside of the U.S.)
See paragraph (b) below for the definition of a fax page.(2) If you registered for the Service prior to December 1, 2013:Within any monthly period, your plan will include the number of inbound and outbound fax pages specified
in the plan that you received when you first signed up to the MetroFax Service, regardless of whether
you are issued a local or a toll-free MetroFax Number, unless we notify you in our sole discretion that
your pricing plan has changed. Faxes sent or received in excess of your plan’s page limit are charged
at the overage rate specified in the plan that you received when you first signed up to the MetroFax
Service, unless we notify you in our sole discretion that your pricing plan has changed and includes
a new fixed overage rate.
See paragraph (b) below for the definition of a fax page.(b) Definition of Fax Page and Associated Terms:Fax Page Definition: Most fax pages take less than sixty (60) seconds to transmit. However, for each transmission,
the number of pages sent or received is calculated based on the greater of the actual number of pages
or the number of full and partial 60-second increments of transmission or connection time, whether or
not the transmission occurs or is completed (such as instances when someone answers the call or transmission
is interrupted before completion). For example, a one page fax with transmission duration of 30 seconds
is recognized as one page, and a one page fax with a transmission duration of one minute and six seconds
is recognized as two pages.Unless the plan that you originally signed up for specifies a different "per page rate" (whether or not it
is referenced as such), the number of outbound fax pages referenced in paragraph (a) of this Section
2 as included in the tiers of Service is administered by applying a monthly outbound usage credit to
your account and assumes that each outbound page is sent to a destination with an applicable per page
rate of $0.10 (which amount may vary outside of the U.S.). Therefore, your number of included outbound
fax pages for a given thirty (30) day period may be less than the number specified for your tier of Service
referenced in paragraph (a) of this Section 2 if you send to destinations with applicable per page usage
rates in excess of $0.03 per fax page. For example, if your service tier includes 100 outbound fax pages per thirty (30) day period, then an outbound
service credit of $10.00 (which amount may vary outside of the U.S.) will be applied to your account.
If you send a 5 page fax to a destination with an applicable per page usage rate of $0.10, then your
usage credit will decrease by $0.50 to $9.50. If you then send a 5 page fax to a destination with an
applicable per page usage rate of $0.20, then your usage credit will decrease by an additional $1.00
to $8.50.Unused inbound or outbound Service credits are valid in the month issued and expire at the conclusion of
each applicable thirty (30) day period. Inbound or outbound Service credits have no cash value. Such
credits do not roll over to the next thirty (30) day period, and you will receive no cash refund in the
event any unused inbound or outbound Service credits remain in your account upon termination or closure
of your accountBack to top

Unsolicited Fax Advertisement/Spam Drop-Box Policy.a. Unsolicited Fax Advertisement Policy. You acknowledge and agree that the Company provides a Service that allows you to send and distribute communications
of your own choosing. the Company is not responsible for the content of your communications and merely
provides a service that allows you to distribute communications of your choosing.The transmission of unsolicited telemarketing phone calls, faxes and email is regulated in Canada, Europe,
the United States and by other countries as well. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications
Commission (CRTC) Canadian Do Not Call rules and regulations, the Telecommunications Act, the Unsolicited
Telecommunications Rules, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and other
regulations govern such communications. In Europe, including the United Kingdom, such communications
are regulated by the Telephone and Fax Preference rules as well as other laws and regulations. The United
States regulates these communications under the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) amended Telemarketing
Sales Rule (TSR) and Do-Not-Call provisions, 16 CFR Part 310, the U.S. Federal Communication Commission’s
regulations implementing the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 CFR 64.1200 et seq.,

provinces and other governmental bodies may have additional laws and regulations. Other countries have
laws and regulations pertaining to such communications. the Company collectively refers to all relevant
laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body governing phone calls, faxes, and emails as "Telemarketing

please unsubscribe accordingly. Please contact customer service if you have questions regarding unsolicited
fax advertisements. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company has any and all rights (but no obligation) to assert any
and all legal claims available against any third party as a result of your receipt of any unsolicited

right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of the Service, including a Discounted
Service.

Company's Customer Service Department within thirty (30) days of the charge date. Failure to do so will
waive your ability to dispute such charges. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for

NON-REFUNDABLE. You agree that for monthly subscriptions, the Company may submit charges for your monthly
service fee each month, and for annual subscriptions, the Company may submit charges for your annual

prior notice (in accordance with the Company's verification procedures, as may be established by the
Company from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization or wish
to change your designated card(s). Such notice will not affect charges submitted before the Company reasonably
could act on your notice. If you add MetroFax Numbers to an existing Service account, your first payment
for such additional MetroFax Numbers may be prorated to coincide with the annual/monthly anniversary
of your first MetroFax Number. You agree that the Company may (at its option) accumulate Service fees
incurred during your monthly billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or
at the end of each cycle, and that the Company may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer
until submission of the accumulated charge(s). This means that accumulated Service fee charges may appear
on the statement you receive from your card issuer.Your activation fee, usage charges, and monthly or annual Service fees, as applicable, must be made by the
credit or debit card(s) designated by you for the Company use and transactions. If your Service account
is a qualified business account approved by the Company for corporate billing, charges will be accumulated,
identified by customer identification number and invoiced on a monthly basis. If the payment method for
your Service account is by credit or debit card and payment is not received by the Company from the card
issuer or its agent or affiliate, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by the Company. Each time

this Agreement) with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.c. Viewing Your Account Balance: To view your current account balance, along with billing details and any
accumulated charges, please click on "Billing" after logging in to the MetroFax Website.d. Free Trial Customers: If you subscribed to the Service pursuant to a special offer granting you a free
trial period, your activation fee and initial service fee will be PRE-AUTHORIZED AGAINST YOUR CREDIT
CARD OR DEBIT CARD LIMIT (meaning the amounts pre-authorized will not be considered available credit
or debit funds in such account). These fees will be immediately charged to your credit or debit card,
without further authorization from you, upon the expiration of such free trial period, unless you provide
prior notice (in accordance with the Company's verification procedures, as may be established by the
Company from time to time in its sole discretion) that you have terminated this authorization. Such notice
will not affect charges submitted before the Company reasonably could act on your notice.e. Pre-Paid Discounts: If you subscribed to the Service pursuant to a special offer granting a pre-paid discount
for a fixed number of months, your pre-paid fees are payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE.

Agreement to Arbitrate All Disputesa. You and the Company agree that all disputes and claims between you and the Company shall be settled by
binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate is intended
to be broadly interpreted and includes, but is not limited to any dispute, claim or controversy arising
out of or relating in any way to the Services, the Company software, the MetroFax Website, the Agreement
or any aspect of the relationship between you and the Company. You agree that, by agreeing to the Agreement,
the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that
you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration provision
does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including,
for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
against the Company on your behalf. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement
and the termination of your account.b. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice
of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to the Company should be addressed to: j2 Cloud Services,
Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 700 S. Flower St., 15th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90017, USA (“Notice
Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set
forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If the Company and you do not reach an agreement
to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an
arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by the Company
or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if
any, to which you or the Company is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate
arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after the Company receives notice
at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment
of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000.c. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures
for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules
and Forms are available online at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of the Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,including issues relating to the scope and enforceability
of this arbitration provision. Unless the Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
take place by video or telephone conference. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, the Company agrees
that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted
to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless
of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator
is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual
damages, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms
and conditions of the Agreement.d. The Company may make a written settlement offer anytime before an arbitrator is selected. If the arbitrator
issues you an award that is greater than the value of the Company’s last written settlement offer
made before an arbitrator was selected (or if the Company did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator
was selected), then the Company will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
be governed by the AAA Rules.e. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
warranted by that party's individual claim.Back to top
