Giva websites and products also comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. Giva has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

In addition, Giva will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete such information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request to access his or her information, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete his or her information pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles by contacting us. With our Privacy Shield certification, Giva has committed to respect those rights.
Also, as part of our participation in these EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, we have agreed to dispute resolution by JAMS for disputes relating to our compliance.

Giva's policy regarding use of your individual identifying information supplied to us or collected via your experience at our online website covers these areas:
1. Notice and Disclosure

Giva collects the following information regarding visitors to our Web site: domain name, name, information regarding what pages are accessed, information volunteered by you, such as survey information, email address, or site registrations, and your preferred means of communication.
Giva does not make individual identifying information available to third parties, including business partners, for marketing purposes. Giva does use such information to contact people for marketing purposes.
2. Choice/Consent

4. Use of Cookies
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web Sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of the Giva Web Site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the site information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

For example, Giva may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify Giva when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of Giva's Web Sites. Giva uses Web beacons to operate and improve Giva's Web Sites and email communications.
