JNCS’s Commitment to Online Security
Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. JNCS encrypts billing information wherever JNCS requests it. All JNCS employees and contractors with access to personal information obtained on the JNCS web site are also bound to adhere to this policy as part of their contract with JNCS.

Personal Information that JNCS May Collect Online
JNCS collects personal and business information online, including names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone and facsimile numbers, and billing information.
JNCS does not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information from children under the age of 13. In addition, no part of our site is designed with the purpose of attracting any person under age 13.
How JNCS Uses Personal Information Collected Online
Unless you otherwise consent, we will use your personal information only for the purpose for which it is submitted,
such as to reply to your emails, send confirmation invoices and shipping notifications, and process billing and
business requests. At certain points where personal information is collected on our site, there may be a box where you
may indicate you would like to be on a mailing list to receive information about specials offered by JNCS. This election box
only appears in places where the department collecting personal information maintains such lists. At any time you can add or
remove your name from a JNCS list by contacting us at (855) 333-3482.

We never sell or rent your personal information.
In order to charge your credit card for the amount of your purchase, your credit card number and name will be transmitted to the bank we use for credit card clearing.
JNCS may also release personal information under the following circumstances:
Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation or is requested by a government agency;
Where our records indicate a purchaser may have engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of;
To appropriate government agencies, where your communication suggests possible harm to others.
