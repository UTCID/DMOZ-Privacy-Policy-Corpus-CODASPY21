Privacy
CleanCode respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.
The entire policy may be summed up in one sentence --
this sentence comes from BestCalls.com, which we borrow here because of
its succinctness:
We never disclose your personal information to anyone, ever.
The remainder of this page explains our practices regarding your
interaction with our site.
General Parameters
This notice is highly visible; every page has a link to it.
You may freely visit CleanCode without identifying yourself.
Should you wish to contact us, the Contact Us page requests
various details from you but they are all optional.
This notice applies to all pages on the CleanCode web site.
Our site contains links (references, articles) to other web sites
which have their own policies. While all such links point you to useful material, each site has its own privacy policy; we encourage you to review the policy of each site you visit.
Our policy is consistent with the Fair Information Practices and the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Principles: Notice, Choice, Access and Accuracy, Onward Transfer Security and Oversight (Enforcement).
Why We Collect What We Collect
On the Contact Us page, we ask for a broad variety of data about your issue to allow us to address your issue to the best of our ability. The information is not used for any other purpose. Furthermore, you are not required to provide any of it -- but generally the more you provide, the quicker we can resolve your issue.
As you browse the CleanCode site, we also collect anonymous data, i.e., data which is not associated with you in any way. This includes things like web pages visited, browser type, and so forth. This information helps us improve the CleanCode website experience for all visitors.
If you choose to register to receive periodic email updates, our registration form asks for contact information (including name and email address), unique identifiers (a
password), and demographic information (like a zip code). CleanCode does not sell, rent or disseminate its user list to any third parties. We email to you only information you have requested. Finally, you may opt-out of future mailings at any time.
How We Collect Data
CleanCode uses cookies to personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer.
Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. With cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. Each time you visit CleanCode your previously saved information can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized (if any).
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies or prompt you for each cookie, if you prefer.
CleanCode also uses web beacons that allow us to count users who have visited each page.
Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they collect only a limited set of information including time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.
