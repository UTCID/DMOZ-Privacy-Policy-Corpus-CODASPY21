Recycle Bin Editor
Accidents happen when using any database. The worst type of accident is when a record or entire series of records are accidentally deleted resulting in hours/days of time lost rebuilding the deleted records. ClassManager has a Recycle Bin feature that instantly restores the deleted records. Also, the Recycle Bid editor records every change made to the data so that you can restore a single field.
CLOSE
Search Editor
How well a database functions is a combination of many factors. One of those factors is can the database application answer business questions. To do so the database should have a set of tools that allows the user to manipulate the data and find answers to your questions. A simple search form is inadequate for that purpose. It can find only the simplest of data request and can view only one table. Often you are required to run multiple searches. The problem is that most registration database products have no capability of searching simultaneously on multiple tables. ClassManager has a Relational Search Editor capable of multi-table searching that can give you the answers that you need to run your business.
CLOSE
Export Import Editor
Any feature rich database should have the ability for the user to export any data element from any table and field in the system. ClassManager if one of the few Registration database products available that allows for complete importing and exporting functionality.
CLOSE
Set Manager
How well a database functions is a combination of many factors. One of those factors is can the database application answer business questions. To do so the database should have a set of tools that allows the user to manipulate the data and find answers to your questions. A simple search form is inadequate for that purpose. It can find only the simplest of data request. Often you are required to run multiple searches. The problem is that most database products have no means of capturing and holding the results of these multiple searches. ClassManager has a Set Manager tool that allows for the capturing of multiple data search results and then can perform set algebra (Union, Difference & Intersection) to give you the data results that you need to run an efficient business.
CLOSE
Fee Rule Editor
The purpose of a Registration database is to manage clients and students as well as charge fees for the educational services provided. Usually charging fees will involve some kind of discount structure based on multiple registrations, number of students, total value of registration fees, time of day, date, etc. Simple or rudimentary databases applications simply cannot handle or process complex discount business rules. ClassManager has a discount editor that allows the user to put in place a set of discount rules that will match whatever discount policy your school has in place.
