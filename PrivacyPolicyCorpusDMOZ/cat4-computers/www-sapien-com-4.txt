SAPIEN Refund Policy
SAPIEN Refund Policy
SAPIEN Technologies, Inc. offers fully functional 45-day trials on all
software. Detailed descriptions of all software are available, and it is
assumed that the buyer has reviewed all available information, operated the
trial version, and is fully satisfied with the software prior to
purchasing. Therefore, all purchased software that has been registered
and/or activated at any time, is non-refundable.
If the software has been purchased in error,
SAPIEN Technologies will extend a refund within 14-days, provided the
software has not been registered to an account and/or activated. Any
registration and/or history of activation of the software will result in
this refund option becoming null and void, and the purchase deemed
non-refundable.
With knowledge of the terms set forth above, our refund policies are as
follows:
1. Only unregistered and non-activated software purchased from
https://www.sapien.com/store is
eligible for a refund, and only within 14-days from the date of purchase.
2. All new licenses that have been registered and/or activated are
non-refundable.
3. All maintenance renewal and reinstatement purchases are non-refundable.
4. No exchanges of software are permitted.
In accordance with our EULA, (Section 6. Warranties and Limitations on
Liability), we will review refund requests on defective Software within 30
days from the date of purchase. Customers must demonstrate a willingness to
cooperate and provide necessary information to assist in solving the
problem. SAPIEN guarantees the quality of its Software but does not warrant
that the operation of the Software be uninterrupted or error free. During
the Warranty Period, if SAPIEN receives notice from the Customer that the
Software does not operate substantially in accordance with such
specifications, then SAPIEN shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
provide a work-around or repair such Software. If SAPIEN is unable, within
a reasonable time, to offer a work-around or repair the Software as
specified above, the Customer shall be entitled to a full refund of the
purchase price from the entity in which it was purchased, upon verification
that the Software was deactivated and unregistered. The foregoing warranty
shall not apply to defects resulting from: (a) improper or inadequate
maintenance by the Customer; (b) Customer supplied software or interfaces;
(c) modification or misuse; or (d) operation outside of the environmental
specifications for the Software.
Please refer to our EULA at
https://www.sapien.com/company/eula
for any additional clarification regarding Section 6. Warranties and
Limitations on Liability.
