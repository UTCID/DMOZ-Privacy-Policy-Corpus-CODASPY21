Website Visitors
Like most website operators, World Wide Woodshed collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. World Wide Woodshed's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how World Wide Woodshed's visitors use its website. From time to
time, World Wide Woodshed may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
World Wide Woodshed also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on worldwidewoodshed.com
blogs/sites. World Wide Woodshed only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.

depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at worldwidewoodshed.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with World Wide Woodshed are asked to
