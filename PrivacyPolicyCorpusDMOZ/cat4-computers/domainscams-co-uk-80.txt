Cancelled Flights – Updated Information for Passengers – 19/04/2010
As the statutory representative for passengers, the Consumer Council has been focused on getting the most up to date information for passengers stranded by cancelled flights due to the volcanic ash cloud.
Consumer Council update on flights situation
– airport carparks will not charge extra
– ferry companies offering alternative travel option
– seats available on Ulsterbus Tours coaches
– updated information and contact details on www.consumercouncil.org.uk
Aodhan O’Donnell, Head of Transport at the Consumer Council said, “We have been in contact with all airlines that operate to and from Northern Ireland to find out what the most up to date situation is for passengers and what help or assistance they can expect in this ever changing situation.  This has been updated on our website. We have also been in contact with the airports to make sure practical arrangements are in place for passengers to help reduce the stress in an already upsetting situation.  For example, if a passenger’s car is parked at the airport and they can’t get home, they will be relieved to know that they won’t be hit with huge parking fees.  All three NI airports are not charging anything extra than the time period passengers paid for at the time of booking.
“The Consumer Council has been looking into other modes of travel that could get passengers to where they need to go if flights remain on hold.  All three ferry companies operating to Northern Ireland are offering passengers an alternative option to get to their destination.  However anyone considering this they should ring in advance to make sure there is space.  Translink also has seats on their Ulsterbus Tour services that operate to and from the UK.
“If anyone who has been affected by the cancelled flights is not happy with the service or information they have received from their airline, they should contact the Consumer Council on 0800 121 6022, visit our website or email complaints@consumercouncil.org.uk.”

Domain Name Facts - know the facts, avoid being scammed
International & UK domains are registered instantly - no other company is informed of the registration and no-one can intervene
International (.com .net .org) domains can be registered for 1 - 10 years, whereas UK (.co.uk .org.uk .ltd.uk .plc.uk .me.uk) domains are registered and renewed at 2 year intervals - it is not possible to register a UK domain for anything more or less than 2 years
Domain names can be registered cheaply, quickly and easily online, you do not necessarily need an agent to register for you
Companies that sell domain names by telesales are almost always scammers
A registration company is not obliged to check trademarks and company names before agreeing to register any domain - this is the registrant's responsibility
Owning a trademark or company name does not automatically entitle you to the matching domain names
It is not possible to "earmark" or reserve a domain name
DON'T send money to companies you've never heard of
