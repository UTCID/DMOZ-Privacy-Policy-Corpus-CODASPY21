If you have given us consent to process your personal data, processing will only take place in accordance with the purposes set out in the consent declaration and to the extent agreed therein. A given consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the data processed until the revocation.
For the protection of legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR)
If necessary in the interests of OBJENTIS Software Integration GmbH or a third party, data processing beyond the actual performance of the contract may take place in order to safeguard our legitimate interests or those of such a third party.

Cookies
Our website uses so-called “cookies.” These are small text files that are stored on your device by your browser. They do no harm to your device.
We use cookies to make our offers more user-friendly. Some cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them, as this allows us to recognize your browser on your next visit.
If you object to the use of cookies, you can set your browser to inform you when cookies are placed and only allow them in individual cases.
Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.
Web analytics
To enable the statistical evaluation of traffic on our website, we use the program AWStats. This program, available from the website http://www.awstats.org/, is a freely available web analytics software distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is used to evaluate log files that our web server generates based on visitor requests. No cookies are used, as the statistical analysis is performed via the log files. These log files contain IP addresses, which are usually not assignable to specific persons. The data used for analysis is not consolidated with other data sources and is furthermore deleted after the statistical evaluation – within six months at the latest. Unlike with other analysis programs, data is not transmitted to any third parties.
External links
To keep you optimally informed, we provide external links on our website that take you to third-party websites. Unless obvious, we indicate whenever a link is external. OBJENTIS Software Integration GmbH has no influence on the content and design of externally linked pages operated by third parties. This also means that the information in this privacy policy does not apply on such pages.
Data security
OBJENTIS Software Integration GmbH uses technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are constantly being improved and adapted in line with technological developments.
Your rights
As a general rule, you are granted the right of access, rectification, deletion (“erasure”), restriction, data portability, revocation and opposition. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection laws or that your data protection rights have otherwise been violated in some way, you may file a complaint with the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the data protection authority.
