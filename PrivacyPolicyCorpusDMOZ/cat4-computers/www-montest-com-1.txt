We have designed our website so that, in general, you can explore the information offered without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide personally identifiable information (name, address, email address, phone number.), you can rest assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with VPI.Please be aware that VPI's privacy practices may vary as required by local laws and policies. Regardless of later updates or changes to our privacy notice, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.
We want you to be informed and aware…
This Online Privacy Statement is provided by VPI in order to make you aware of our privacy practices, and of the choices you can make about how information is collected and used. VPI's Online Privacy Statement is available from our homepage and from every page where information is collected.

Cookies At some of VPI's websites, technologies such as "cookies" may be used to assist in our web traffic analysis. A "cookie" is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.

Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are retained in encrypted form only. We may also occasionally use your information to contact you for market research or provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. VPI will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact. In addition, we will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt-in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Contact information such as products purchased, source of lead, date of first contact and last purchase, and type of information requested, are collected and are linked to personally identifiable information such as name and address in our database. This information is analyzed in a consolidated form to determine future product and advertising initiatives to best serve our customers.

Access to hard copy paperwork is limited through the use of locked cabinets in our facilities and a security system is also in place to protect our premises. All employees, agents and affiliates of VPI have who might have access to confidential customer information in the conduct of their duties have agreed to hold this information in confidence, not to use it for any purpose except to carry out the service they are providing for our organization, and to honor our privacy and security policies in the way this information is handled.

VPI's Privacy Advocate is responsible for conducting investigations into any alleged computer or network compromises, incidents or problems and ensuring the proper disciplinary action is taken against those who violate VPI's Information Security Policy. Any security compromises or potential security compromises and any inquiries concerning security should be reported to privacy.advocate@vpi.us.
Information sharing policies…
Certain transactions you may initiate inherently indicate a request to share your information with VPI partners or associates. For instance, when you fill out the contact form to request information from one of our International Distributors, that request will be forwarded to the Distributor in question. If you post to the VPI forum Message Board, other participants will be able to read and respond to that post. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. The information shared with these partners does not include sensitive information such as credit card numbers, credit information, medical information, social security numbers or other related information, nor personally identifiable information regarding children.
VPI will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information provided to us online with others without first letting you know and offering you a choice. See Ability to Opt-Out for additional information.
How we ensure the accuracy of the information…
VPI strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We commit to responding promptly to any question about the accuracy of information from our customers. You may make a request to VPI for access to the information VPI maintains in its database, and review this information in order to correct, amend, or delete that information when it is inaccurate. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable measures to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. This right only applies to personal information relating to the individual making the request and is subject to other limitations as defined by law. If you wish to make an access request, VPI's Privacy Advocate will explain the process to be followed.

VPI does not charge any fee for the processing of reasonable requests.

Future use…
As VPI develops its business, there may be a change of control of Video Products Inc, or subsidiaries, affiliates or portions of VPI. In this situation, customer information is typically considered a transferable asset. Also, in the unlikely occurrence that Video Products Inc or a part of its divisions, affiliates or subsidiaries are purchased, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
VPI reserves the right to make changes to our online privacy policy as business or technical needs require. In the future, should VPI decide to use the information that you provided in a substantially new way, we would notify you based on the email address you provided and offer you the opportunity to opt out of the new use. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, we would like to know so we can address them. Please contact the privacy.advocate@vpi.us or call 1-800-626-7801.
