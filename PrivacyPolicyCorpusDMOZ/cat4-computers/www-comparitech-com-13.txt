5 Best Cheap VPNs of 2020 (that don’t compromise speed or privacy)
There are plenty of cheap VPNs but many sacrifice speed or skimp on security while others won't work with your favorite streaming services. These 5 budget VPN services punch well above their weight.

There is no shortage of cheap Virtual Private Network (VPN) service providers, but does a low-cost service mean sacrificing some of the features any good VPN should include? Will the cheapest VPNs keep your online activity private? Will they work with streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and BBC iPlayer?
We take a look at 5 affordable VPN services that cut prices but not corners.
VPN services don’t usually cost an arm and a leg but we understand that there are many users out there on a tight budget looking for cheap, reliable options. Free VPN services don’t cut it because they’ll usually skimp on download speeds and encryption standards.
What exactly is a VPN?
For the uninitiated, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a software that helps you stay safe and secure on the web. The service works by encrypting all the web traffic to and from your account and routing it via an intermediary server of your choice. This helps keep nosy surveillance agencies and hackers at a distance and also makes it seems like you’re accessing the internet from a different location.
The latter feature makes it possible to unlock geo-restricted content on streaming services. That’s one of the reasons why foreign expats find a VPN to be an excellent choice for staying in touch with content from back home.
Opting to use a VPN is an excellent choice in the first place, so in this article, we’ll take you through our list of the ones that are inexpensive, reliable, and deliver the most bang for your buck.
We get into plenty of details on each of the providers we feature below, but if you can’t stick around for the whole article, below is our summary of the cheapest VPNs, that still offer quality service and robust online security.
Best Cheap VPNs in 2020:
NordVPN – Our top choice. Superfast and works well for streaming. Solid security and privacy.
Surfshark – Best budget option. Unblocks Netflix, no logs, and decent security. Unlimited simultaneous connections.
CyberGhost – Good for beginners. It’s very fast, unblocks Netflix, great security, and no logs.
PrivateVPN – Cheapest VPN on this list. Simple interface, unblocks Netflix, fast speeds, and good security.
Private Internet Access – Good security, no logs, and offers some more advanced options.
We excluded ExpressVPN, one of our top-ranked VPNs, from this list as it doesn’t qualify as a budget option. While it is a solid option, it is one of the more expensive VPNs on the market. If you are considering ExpressVPN you can save 49% with this ExpressVPN coupon.
VPN criteria
Our ranking is predicated on the following factors:
Value for money (obviously!)
Reliable download speeds and encryption standards
Varied server network with widely distributed server locations
Unlocks geo-restricted content (such as Netflix)

Surfshark is a newer VPN that’s great for unblocking Netflix and other streaming services without adding too much onto your monthly bill. It works in China and allows torrenting, too.
Prices start at $2.21 per month.
Every connection is protected with strong encryption, and Surfshark doesn’t store any logs of user activity or other identifying information. 24/7 live chat support is ready to help.

CyberGhost is an excellent option for beginner users on a budget that want a plug-and-play option without many frills or customizable options.
Prices start at $2.25 per month.
The company is headquartered in Romania – out of the reach of any mandatory data retention laws. The company abides by a strict no-logging policy. Torrenting is permitted on most servers except those located in the United States, Russia, China, and Singapore.
CyberGhost operates thousands of servers in more than 89 countries. It’s the fastest VPN we’ve tested in 2019, and it also tops the list of the most secure VPNs in our annual VPN security assessment.
CyberGhost makes it easy to unblock your favorite streaming sites like Netflix and BBC iPlayer by selecting them right from the app, rather than guessing at which server locations work.
Apps are available for both Linux, Android, and iOS as well as desktop support for Windows and MacOS. A maximum of seven devices can connect simultaneously.
Pros:
Very fast
Great security and a no-logs policy
Unblocks US Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and more

4. PrivateVPN
Apps Available:
PC
Mac
IOS
Android
Linux
Website:
www.PrivateVPN.com
Money-back guarantee: 30 DAYS
PrivateVPN is a relative newcomer in the industry and doesn’t offer the expansive server network that’s a hallmark of players like NordVPN. But the service is cheap, easy-to-use, and packs a punch when it comes to speed and stability.
Prices start at $1.89 per month.
PrivateVPN says it stores zero logs of any kind about its users. The service offers DNS leak protection, an internet kill switch, and IPv6 protection as standard. Encryption standards are also tough. PrivateVPN uses 128-bit CPC encryption for TAP and 256-bit AES for TUN on the default OpenVPN protocol. 2,048-DHE keys provide perfect forward secrecy.
PrivateVPN doesn’t have many servers, but it does unblock more international Netflix libraries than any other VPN we’ve tested. It also unblocks other geo-restricted sites like BBC iPlayer and Hulu.
There are apps for Android and iOS as well as desktop apps for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Torrenting is permitted, and one user can connect up to six devices at any time.
Pros:
Fast servers
Unblocks Netflix and other streaming sites
Strong security and no logs
6 simultaneous connections
Cons:
Fewer servers than rivals
Our score:
4.5 out of 5
GREAT SPEEDS:PrivateVPN is a good family choice. Download speeds were surprisingly good at this end of the market. Could do with having more servers. 30-day money-back guarantee.

Private Internet Access (PIA) isn’t flashy, but it’s powerful and does the job well. The company doesn’t store any logs and uses the best encryption standards available.
Prices start at $3.49 per month.
PIA offers a pretty diverse range of server locations – there are 3,272 of them spread across 25 countries including many in the Western hemisphere. Torrenting is permitted on all servers.
A user may connect up to five devices with a single account. PIA supports Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work with Netflix.
Pros:
Offers some more advanced settings
Strong security
No logs
Cons:
Doesn’t reliably unblock Netflix
Some slow speeds
Our score:
4.0 out of 5
GOOD PERFORMER:Private Internet Access offers strong security, a low price, and great customer service. Speeds can be inconsistent. 7-day money back guarantee.

Will free VPNs do the job?
Users short on cash might be tempted to go for a free VPN service. They’re present on the internet and don’t require you to fork over your credit card details – luring and enticing users who think they’re getting the real deal.
We recommend you proceed with caution. Many such ‘free’ services have been caught indulging in fairly abhorrent practices such as forcefully injecting tracking cookies, mining your data, and selling it to third-party advertisers. It’s a handy reminder of the fact that when the product is free, usually you end up being the product.
Other VPNs might be freemium which means that even if they don’t steal your data, they’ll definitely subject you to download caps, bandwidth throttling, and a small selection of servers (usually only one or two). They’re not bothered with robust encryption either, so there’s a continued risk of being exposed.
After all, such companies are registered businesses too. They need to make money to pay for salaries, office space, and server maintenance. Our recommendation is to avoid these traps to stay safe. Cough up a few dollars each month – it’ll be worth it.
