Essentials:
Overview
User Content License
An OpenPrivacy
Grassroots Initiative
Overview:
A User Content License (UCL) is an agreement between an Internet user and
the company/individual whose web site the user is currently visiting.
It
provides a mechanism through which a user may inform the site she is
visiting of the policies policies that must be used to protect her privacy
and data.
A UCL is a license or policy agreement which originates on the
user's computer.
Every time the user requests a web page the UCL is encoded
and transferred to the server computer answering the query.
At this point
the server has a chance to 'opt-out' of this transaction.
Currently, when a user goes to a web site, they must agree to the privacy
policy of that web site.
This has a number of problems:
Few users ever even read the privacy policy [1],[2] posted on a site, yet they are implicitly bound
by its content in much the same way that "shrinkwrap" licenses bind
users of software to the usually unread license agreements printed on
them.
Unlike shrinkwrap licenses, companies can change their web-based
privacy policy at any time and may currently legally do so without
needing to notify their existing user base [3].
Though a company may have strong privacy policies when they start up,
they may later be acquired by an entity with different views or simply
change their viewpoint themselves as the quantity - and thus the value -
of their collected profile data grows.
This can result in massive, but
unfortunately legal, privacy violations.
If a company files for bankruptcy it has little incentive to preserve
your privacy.
It might choose to maximize its worth by selling its customer
database.
Companies often keep credit card information within an internal database.
If this system is cracked these numbers can be stolen.
These are virtual
gold mines for "black-hat" hackers on the Internet.
Technical:
The User Content License works with the HTTP protocol and can
theoretically support any server/browser combination. The mechanism is
very simple, adding one additional HTTP header prior to an HTTP
request being transferred. A valid request would look like:
GET http://hailstorm.microsoft.com/ HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: GNU/Linux and Mozilla
UCL-User-License: UCL LICENSE/POLICY HERE
UCL-About: http://ucl.openprivacy.org
A web site would see an encoded UCL such as:
"By responding to this HTTP request, you are accepting the practices described
in this Privacy Notice. You will not give my information out to others and you
understand that I maintain copyright on all original information and its
compilation."
In order to be able to opt-out a web site must have a reliable mechanism to
determine what policies are encoded here.
The Platform for Privacy
Preferences (P3P) [5] could be used to resolve this and
related issues and we may add additional HTTP headers and payloads so that
web sites have better mechanisms to opt-out.
Future Directions:
Finish and release a Mozilla plugin.
Try to get this incorporated into
Mozilla 1.0.
Integrate with Internet Explorer.
Currently a UCL is only supported from
IE when you use some type of proxy which can add headers.
Add interactive web site/user policy negotiation.
This could allow a web site
to ask for addition rights (may we give this information to our partner?) to
which the user could possibly agree to
The receiving web site (server) would see an encoded UCL like:
"By responding to this HTTP request, you are accepting the practices described
in this Privacy Notice. You will not give my information out to others and you
understand that I maintain copyright on all original information and its
compilation."
We need to determine the legal standing of this mechanism.
If such basis
exists, we need to create a legally binding User Content License (UCL) to
be included with all such GET requests.
Software:
We have defined a Mozilla plug-in [6]which modifies
the HTTP stream so that a UCL is included.
Currently this isn't very
modular and can't be easily separated for publication.
Hopefully this
will be resolved soon and a 1.0 version released.
Future Directions:
Determine legal standing for this mechanism and create an actual UCL.
Finish and release a Mozilla plug-in. Petition to get this
incorporated into Mozilla 1.0 [7].
Integrate with Internet Explorer.
Currently a UCL is only supported
from IE when you use some type of proxy which can add headers.
Add interactive web site/user policy negotiation [8].
This could allow a
web site to ask for addition rights (may we give this information to our
partner?) to which the user might agree.
