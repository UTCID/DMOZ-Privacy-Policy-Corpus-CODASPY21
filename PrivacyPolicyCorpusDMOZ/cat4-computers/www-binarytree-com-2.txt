We’re certified under the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

Like many of our clients, we’re taking steps to get ready for the upcoming European GDPR, which goes into effect May 25, 2018.
To that end, we’re happy to share a key milestone—we’ve gone through the certification process for the Privacy Shield framework. This is a self-certification program run by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. The framework reflects the new requirements for foreign exchanges of personal data and information for commercial purposes.
To get certified, we took these steps:
Did our homework to make sure our software, services, and internal processes align with the requirements of the framework
Updated our privacy policy to explain how we collect and use personal data
Submitted an entry on the Privacy Shield site (check us out here)
This is yet another step in our long history of complying with strict security and privacy standards. For example, we adopted EU Model Clauses. We also currently hold ISO 27001 certification.
