myFry's Accounts
For the convenience of our customers, our site offers the myFry's Accounts, a quick entry feature for express checkout. Enter your billing and shipping information once, either when placing an order or by using the "myFry's Your Account" text link at the top of the page in the red navigation bar. The next time you place an order on our site, you can use your myFry's Accounts to automatically fill in the information for you.
Set Up or Change Your myFry's Accounts from Any Page
You can set up or change your profile by clicking on the "myFry's Your Accounts" text link at the top of the page in the red navigation bar. You will then be brought to a secure area where you will be given the option of either setting up a new account or of making changes to an existing one.
Enter your
billing and shipping information as you want it to be stored in your myFry's Accounts. You, and only you, can access this information using a password chosen by you. Type a password of six or more characters into the Password field. Type the password again in the second Password field. (These two entries will be compared to prevent typos. If the entries don't match, you will be asked to enter them again.) To continue shopping, select a map listed at the top of the myFry's Accounts window or a category tab at the top of the page. The next time you place an order, you can use your myFry's Accounts to enter this information for you. Please note, your password cannot be accessed by anyone. And if you forget your password, we can send your password by clicking on the "forgot password" link provided at the myFry's Accounts login page.
Set Up Your myFry's Accounts when Ordering
After you have submitted your order you will be given the opportunity to sign up for a myFrys Express Checkout. Simply create your Frys.com password as explained in Set Up or Change Your myFry's Accounts. This information will be stored as your myFry's Accounts.
