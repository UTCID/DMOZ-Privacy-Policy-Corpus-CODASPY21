Challenge for the Legal Industry
The FilesAnywhere web-based solution allows for operating efficiency with remote access to critical data from the office to the courtroom. Beyond physical hardware, cost reduction also occurs with a decrease in supporting infrastructure; including the elimination of software licensing and ongoing updates. This lowers office resource expenditures, such as printing, courier cost, filing, and document retrieval.
