Link Privacy
Home› Products› Link Privacy›
Protecting your hard earned links from your competitors should be every webmaster's top priority. But even more so, is a program that does it WITHOUT snooping to know which sites you are placing the protection on. Ours respects your privacy and it's free. Wait...what? How can it be free?!?! What's the catch? No catch. We've been doing SEO since '96 and we decided that this type of protection was important enough for everyone to have, so it is our way of giving back to the community. We also back it with a guarantee. If you can find a footprint, an exploit, or a "call back to the mothership", we'll give you $100 and then patch it up. Watch the short video to understand the power of this plugin. http://www.LinkPrivacy.com/
