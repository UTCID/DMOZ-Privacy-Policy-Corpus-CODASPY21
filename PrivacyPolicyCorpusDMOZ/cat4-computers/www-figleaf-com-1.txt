FAQ
Can I use FigLeaf on all my devices?
FigLeaf currently works on Windows. We’re adding more devices soon.
Does FigLeaf work on all websites?
We’ve designed FigLeaf to work on most websites. But in the rare case that you come across a site where FigLeaf doesn’t auto-fill your details or save your credentials, please let our Customer Support team know.
Please note that FigLeaf doesn’t offer to generate masked emails on email service provider websites, like Gmail and Yahoo. Since you’re going there to create an email address, we don’t want to get in the way.
Is there a cost to use FigLeaf?
We’re currently in beta and focused on delivering the best possible product thanks to feedback from our users.
During our beta phase, our product is free to enjoy. We expect to announce pricing in the near future.
Does FigLeaf have access to my private data?
No. We need your email address to make FigLeaf work across all your devices, but that’s about it.
Everything you choose to share with FigLeaf is fully encrypted. And to decrypt your data,
FigLeaf needs your password.
What is breached account?
Breached account is an account with publicly available credentials which were found by FigLeaf.
What does Password Conflict mean?
This means that FigLeaf detected 2 different passwords for an account. Just pick the correct one and you’ll be good to go.
Does Private Connection have any limitations?
Right now, Microsoft Edge does not support the technology that FigLeaf Private Connection requires. But everything works great in Chrome and Mozilla.

Hi stranger!
Yes, stranger. We’re a privacy company, so we’re not interested in knowing too much about you. That means we don’t track your individual behavior on our site, or collect any personal info without your knowledge. Check out our
Privacy Promise for all the info.
Heads up — Your platform is not supported
We’re working hard to make FigLeaf available everywhere, but right now the
beta app is compatible with Windows only.
Hmm... FigLeaf isn’t compatible with your version of Windows
Sorry about this, but you need to upgrade to Windows 10.1803 or later to get
the most out of FigLeaf.
