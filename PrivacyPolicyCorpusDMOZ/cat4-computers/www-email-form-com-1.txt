The Information We May Gather
Non-personally-identifiable information
General: When users come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating their home server, but not their e-mail addresses. Such information helps us identify the most popular content and portions of our Site and determine the effectiveness of our various promotional activities. We aggregate such information for internal review and thereafter it's superseded by more recent information.
Personally Identifiable Information
(a) General: In certain areas of this Site, we require that you provide us with personally-identifiable information, in order to be able to use that portion or those portions of this Site. For instance, the names and contact information of persons who visit our Web sites are added to our data base so that, for example, they may be contacted in the future regarding Web-Site-Scripts.com 's products, services or future opportunities. Such contact may occur by email, telephone or mail, as Web-Site-Scripts.com deems appropriate.
(b) Lack of Web-Site-Scripts.com Responsibility For Third Party Content On Site: Web-Site-Scripts.com cannot and does not control the acts of the users of its Web site's services or monitor the accuracy of postings by such users. All users should be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room, or other forum or public area of this Site, the information might be collected, circulated, and used by others. In the event that you encounter any user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact us at info@email-form.com .
How We Use The Information We Gather
How We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We aggregate data on users' home servers for internal review purposes, in order to build higher quality, more useful online services and better products, e.g., by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our users. Following such internal review, such aggregated information is then superseded by more recent information.
How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information: Web-Site-Scripts.com provides notice to users that personally-identifiable (i.e., non-aggregated) information will be collected during the Web-browsing process; this Privacy Policy also serves as notice that such information is collected under those circumstances. Web-Site-Scripts.com may use such information to enhance your experience by providing such information to appropriate third parties, including any outsourcers, as reviewed and selected by Web-Site-Scripts.com .
Web-Site-Scripts.com reserves the right to disclose information contained in our access logs concerning any user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. In particular, we reserve the right to disclose such when a user is in violation of our current or later Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or initiates or participates (or is reasonably believed so) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law.
In reviewing the information above, please keep in mind that Web-Site-Scripts.com cannot and does not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including other Site users, including the manner in which they might use information received either from Web-Site-Scripts.com or independently.
