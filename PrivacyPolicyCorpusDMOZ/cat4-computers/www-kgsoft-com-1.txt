Orders
When ordering a product from us, the purchaser's name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date are encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and passed through to the credit card processing company. This is necessary for processing and fulfilling orders and providing notification of the order status. If you don't wish to disclose your credit card number, feel free to order by mail using a check. You can also pay by international wire transfer, in which case we will know only the account holder name and the email address to which we should email the registration codes.
