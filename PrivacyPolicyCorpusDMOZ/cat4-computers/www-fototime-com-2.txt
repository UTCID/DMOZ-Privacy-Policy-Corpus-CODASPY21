right to modify the terms of service at any time and without
notice.
This agreement governs the user and member services on this
Site and FotoAlbum software. Use of this Site constitutes acceptance of these terms and creates a binding legal agreement wherein you agree to use the Site
and software in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and according to the terms and conditions listed below.
Terms of Membership
FotoTime has two membership plans that you can select from, a basic membership and a subscription membership.
A Basic membership is FREE, it includes 500 MB of storage space.
A Subscription membership includes 8GB of storage space for FotoShare users or 16GB or storage space for FotoStudio users.
Subscription memberships also include additional features.
A valid e-mail address is required, and the account must be validated
within 24 hours of registration, or it will be de-activated.
Once a member has registered, they will be able to create
albums to organize and share their photographs.
Both Basic and Subscription membership plans get a free license to use the subscriber edition of FotoAlbum during the subscription period.
Subscribers also get a discounted price to upgrade to FotoAlbum Pro.
Membership and the FotoTime service is also governed by the FotoTime Privacy Statement. Please

FotoTime claims no ownership rights to the photographs
uploaded to your account.  Members do grant to FotoTime, Inc.
any permissions necessary to manage your pictures including
but not limited to:
FotoTime has the rights to
show your photos to visitors of your account
FotoTime has the right to back them up during standard system backups
FotoTime has the right to remove photos
if we find that you do not own them (someone else has copyrights to them).
FotoTime can
send
your photos to
a third party for printing if you or one of your guests
orders
prints from
your account
FotoTime will
not use any Member's images for any promotional purpose
without obtaining the Member's permission.
Storage Limit
The FotoTime membership plan governs how many pictures you can store on FotoTime.
A basic membership includes 500 MB of online storage.
A subscription membership includes 8GB of storage space for FotoShare users or 16GB or storage space for FotoStudio users.
A subscription membership can be upgraded at any time to include more space than what you originally purchased.
Subscription upgrades prices are pro-rated until the end of you subscription term.
Disk space is based on actual disk space used by the files in your account, not by the number of pictures you have.
Members are advised to backup all content stored on FotoTime, and to
not rely on FotoTime as a backup source for photographs.
FotoTime assumes no responsibility for loss of any data stored by a Member on this Site,
nor makes any representation, express or implied warranty or guarantee as to the
length of time that a Member's data will be stored after an expired membership.
Storage and Inactivity
A FotoTime basic membership provides continual free usage for free on-line sharing of images as long as the account stays active.
If your free membership goes inactive for a 12 month period, an notice will be sent to the account's e-mail address notifying you that your account will be purged unless it becomes active again (activity is defined as uploading, removing, or changing content within your account).
FotoTime is not responsible for the account owner not receiving their notice of inactivity and subsequent account termination.
A FotoTime subscription membership provides 12 months of on-line sharing of images from the date the membership was purchased.
If the subscription membership expires and is not renewed, the account will revert back to a basic membership,
and the account will be subject to the basic membership storage and inactivity rules.
Bandwidth Limits
FotoTime monitors the bandwidth used by each account on a monthly basis.
FotoTime limits the monthly bandwidth usage for subscription accounts to five times the amount of space for your membership plan.
For example, if your storage plan included 8GB of storage, your montly bandwidth allotment would be 40GB of transfers each month before corrective measures are taken.
For the basic or ad-sponsored membership (500 MB), bandwidth is limited
to four times the amount of your storage space, or a total of 2000 MB of transfers each
month before corrective measures are taken.
The following corrective actions will be taken when an account exceeds it's monthly bandwidth limit:
Turning off the sharing of videos
Reducing the size of pictures that are shared on 3rd party sites such as EBay auctions or other web communities.
Accounts that exceed the bandwidth allotment will be set back to complete
functionality at the beginning of the next month.
FotoTime does retain the right to remove any pictures that cause
an excessive amount of bandwidth to be used. Most often
the type of material that causes bandwidth problems also falls
within the "Inappropriate Content or Use" section below.
Inappropriate Content or Use
FotoTime does not control the content of any Member
pictures and does not have any obligation to monitor such content. Therefore, all content is the responsibility of the Member, not FotoTime.

the above.

Free membership accounts cannot use FotoTime to link back to their websites or promote non photographic businesses (a paid subscription membership must be used).
Free membership accounts cannot be used in efforts to advertise businesses, link to back to business websites, or to create links to improve SEO rankings.
We consider this

If you want to use FotoTime in this manner, you must use a subscription membership.
