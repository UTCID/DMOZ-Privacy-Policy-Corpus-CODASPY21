Terms & Conditions
TheBestDesigns.com (“our website”, "we" or "us") provides a platform for website visitors to view various web designs and themes, and to create an account to submit their own web designs and themes. We offer this service to you through the website (https://www.thebestdesigns.com) which is conditioned on your agreement to adhere to the following Terms of Service without modification. Your use of this website and / or your creation of an account confirms your agreement to these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service are subject to change at any time, without prior notice.
Age and Competency: You affirm that you are more than 18 years of age and competent enough to enter into the terms set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
Privacy Policy: Privacy is important to us, and we respect your privacy. You understand that by visiting this website and/or creating an account, you agree to the policies stated in our privacy policy which you can read about in more detail here.
Website Listing Guidelines: TheBestDesigns.com has the right to deny a listing or remove a website for any reason at any time. There is no minimum guaranteed time that a website will be listed on TheBestDesigns.com. Unacceptable content will be defined by TheBestDesigns.com on a case-by-case basis, which may include but is not limited to content that is controversial, sexually explicit, hateful to a person or group of persons, violent, dangerous to the public or individual, or any other type of content that TheBestDesigns.com deems unacceptable.
Theme Submission Fee: The theme submission fee covers the cost of evaluating your theme for approval and is non-refundable after you theme has been added to our Themes Directory. This fee does not guarantee that your theme will be listed for a specific amount of time, and we reserve the right to remove your theme from TheBestDesigns.com at any time, and for any reason. Some of the reasons your theme may be removed, but not limited to these reasons: 1) If your theme does not exist anymore or is no longer functioning; 2) If your theme changed since the approval and no longer qualifies; 3) If harmful code is discovered in your theme; 4) If complaints are received about your theme from visitors; 5) If errors are being displayed on your theme; 6) If your theme includes unacceptable content as defined in "Website Listing Guidelines" above; 7) If the Themes section is removed from TheBestDesigns.com 8) If TheBestDesigns.com is sold and the new owners remove your theme; 9) If TheBestDesigns.com shuts down. After your theme is accepted, it will be featured on the site within 2-5 business days. A refund exception can be granted if during the review process, we request edits or fixes to your theme that you cannot fix or don't agree with. In this case, you can receive a refund, and your theme will not be added to TheBestDesigns.com.
Theme Submission URL's / Affiliates: If you are submitting a theme, you must be the owner / developer of that theme. Third-party sellers and affiliates cannot submit themes. We must be able to correspond with the theme owner / developer to discuss possible changes and fixes during the review. If affiliate URL's, referral URL's or shortened URL's (such as bit.ly) are submitted, your submission will automatically be rejected. We also work with trusted theme shops as an affiliate, and we reserve the right to append our affiliate / referral ID to a submitted theme URL that belongs to one of our theme shop partners. Adding our affiliate ID to your theme URL does not take the place of the submission fee, and all themes submitted, which pass the preliminary screening, must pay the submission fee to be evaluated for approval.
Themes: The themes featured here are not owned or created by The Best Designs. They are selected to be featured from the Theme Shops that we are partnered with and trust, based on their features and design. Themes are purchased on the external theme websites, and a small portion of the sales are paid to The Best Designs for the referrals. We are also selective, so not all themes from our Theme Shop partners are featured here.
