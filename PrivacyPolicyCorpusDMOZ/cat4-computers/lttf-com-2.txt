You acknowledge and agree that neither LTTF.com nor any of its licensors shall be liable to you in the event LTTF.com is ordered or required, as a result of a court order or legal settlement, or contractual requirement with any licensor, to desist from using or permitting the use of a particular email address or domain. If as a result of such action, you lose an e-mail address or domain, your sole remedy shall be the receipt of a replacement e-mail address or domain.
TERMINATION
LTTF.com may terminate your access to any part or all of the Service and any related service(s) at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, for any reason whatsoever.
LTTF.com reserves the right to terminate your e-mail address in the event that LTTF.com’s rights to use the primary domain name terminate or expire. In addition, LTTF.com retains the right, at LTTF.com’s sole discretion, to terminate any and all parts of the LTTF.com Service provided to you, without refunding to you any annual fees paid but not yet accrued, if it determines that you have failed to comply with any of the terms of the “TOS”. If LTTF.com determines that you have failed to comply with any of the terms in the “TOS”, LTTF.com when appropriate, (1) facilitate criminal prosecution against you by referring your spamming activity to the appropriate legal authorities, and (2) bring a civil action against you, who shall be liable to LTTF.com for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages incurred by LTTF.com as a result of your spamming or other prohibited activity.
LTTF.com may also terminate your account for inactivity, which is defined as failing to log into the Service for an extended period of time, as determined by LTTF.com. The amount of time that LTTF.com currently views as an “extended” period of time is a first login to e-mail 10 days or later after registration and after an initial e-mail login, 90 days since your last e-mail login. Upon termination of the Service, your right to use the Service immediately ceases.
If you wish to terminate your account, your only recourse is to discontinue the use of the Service or contact a LTTF.com representative at service@lttf.com .
LTTF.com shall have no obligation to maintain any content in your account or to forward any unread or unsent messages to you or any third party.
NO SPAM; DAMAGES
LTTF.com will immediately terminate any account which it believes, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk e-mail. In addition, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay LTTF.com liquidated damages of $5 for each piece of spam or unsolicited bulk e-mail transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account, otherwise you agree to pay LTTF.com’s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
PARTICIPATION IN PROMOTIONS OF ADVERTISERS
Any dealings with Advertisers on the Service or participation in promotions, including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and the Advertiser or other third party. LTTF.com shall not be responsible or liable for any part of any such dealings or promotions.
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO CONTENT
You acknowledge that content, including but not limited to text, software, music, sound, photographs, video, graphics or other material contained in either sponsor advertisements or electronically distributed, commercially produced information presented to you by the Service, by LTTF.com, or LTTF.com’s Advertisers or other content providers, is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws.

LEGAL NOTICES: Acceptable Use Restricted Content
Client is expected to use the Internet with respect, courtesy, and responsibility, giving due regard to the rights of other Internet users. Client is expected to use his/her account for the purposes of maintaining a website only. Common sense is the best guide as to what is considered acceptable use.
LTTF.com forbids websites with adult graphic content (softcore and/or hardcore), including, but not limited to, banners advertising any adult website(s), child pornography, and distribution of adult website passwords. Client’s whose accounts are found in violation of this policy may, at the discretion of LTTF.com , have their account(s) terminated without notice and are subject to a maximum clean-up/disconnect fee.
Client’s whose website promotes activities that violate federal, state, local laws and/or violation of U.S. export restrictions are also not welcome at LTTF.com . This includes “warez” sites (freely distributing copyright programs), or sites promoting hacking and/or cracking programs. Client’s whose accounts are found in violation of this policy may, at the discretion of LTTF.com , have their account(s) terminated without notice and are subject to a maximum clean-up/disconnection fee. Additionally, LTTF.com may contact the Software Piracy Association (“SPA”) and release any information in connection with any illegal activities relating to software piracy on the Client’s account.
Sites whose primary purpose is for file distribution or mirroring of a site are strictly prohibited.
IRC Bots, or any other automaton programs written in C, Perl or IRC-script used specifically in conjunction with IRC are not allowed. These programs tie up system resources and are in no way related to maintaining a website. Clients are not allowed to have any programs, including but not limited to, Eggdrop, or any other IRC-related programs, within their account. Client agrees not to upload the tar file for any of these programs or to execute them within their account. The first violation of this policy will result in the IRC-related program to be removed from the Client’s account and LTTF.com will notify the Client immediately of the violation. The second violation of this policy may, at the discretion of LTTF.com , result in the Client’s account(s) being terminated without notice and a maximum clean-up/disconnect fee.
Simply put, we ask that you use your account for the purposes of hosting a non-adult oriented, legal website.
E-mail/Spam Policy
Spamming is the sending of unsolicited e-mail, regardless of size or volume, to persons the sender does not know or have prior consent to send the message to. Using fictitious e-mail addresses @LTTF.com or any domain name hosted with LTTF.com is strictly forbidden. Spamming also includes sending unsolicited advertisements to numerous email addresses or newsgroups and/or generating a significantly higher volume of outgoing email than a normal user. A violation of this policy extends to clients who send unsolicited e-mail from a domain name not affiliated or hosted with LTTF.com but the mail message makes mention of a website hosted with LTTF.com.
LTTF.com allows clients to send mailings to subscribers of their own mailing list. Such mailings must have explicit instructions to the recipient on how to remove his/her name from the list, and all requests to do so must be honored immediately. Client agrees not to send mailings to lists provided by an outside agency or individual. Client further agrees not to provide mailing list services to others. Due to the nature of a shared-server environment, LTTF.com requests that mailing lists be sent during non-peak hours, specifically between the hours of 1:00 am and 5:00 am, Central Time. LTTF.com reserves the right to terminate a client’s mailing program, whether provided by LTTF.com or not, immediately and without notification to client if said list causes a problem with the e-mail services of other clients. LTTF.com also reserves the right to forbid a client from utilizing any mail-sending program that jeopardizes the mail services of other clients.
Providing spamware or spam related programs is strictly prohibited. Additionally, clients may not have e-mail lists available for download on the site.
Due to the consumption of system resources and overloading of the e-mail server, LTTF.com forbids the use of the Gossamer Links program by any client.
Trolling, the posting of outrageous messages to generate numerous responses, is also not allowed. Mailbombing, the sending of multiple messages without significant new content to the same user and/or subscribing someone else to a mailing list without that person’s permission, cross-posting articles to an excessive number of newsgroups, or attempting without authorization to enter into a secured computer system is strictly forbidden. LTTF.com reserves the right to determine what constitutes abuse of this policy. Clients whose accounts are found in violation of this policy may, at the discretion of LTTF.com , have their account(s) terminated without notice and are subject to a maximum $500 clean-up/disconnection fee. Sites closed for violations of this policy will not be reinstated under any circumstance.
Copyrighted Material
It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that all information within their account is their own work. Due to distribution rights of shareware programs, clients may not distribute freeware software programs unless the programs are their own work. Copyrighted materials include art, music and other works. MP3 is a popular file format for encoding music. While we do not ban MP3s, we do ask that any MP3s you have on your website are not in violation of any copyrights. Copyrighted music, in any format, cannot be placed within client’s account. Clients agree to indemnify LTTF.com of any possible litigation involving trademark or copyrighted materials.
Client agrees not to modify any copyright notices in features (Perl programs, etc.) provided by LTTF.com . Modification of scripts provided by LTTF.com without written permission is strictly prohibited.
Excessive Usage
Client agrees to take all responsibility for all programs including CGI scripts executed under their account. Programs that consume an excessive amount of CPU run time or Random Access Memory (RAM) are not permitted. Client agrees and understands that such excessive use can have an adverse effect on the performance of the webserver. Client agrees to accept responsibility for programs executed under his/her account, regardless of who authored the program. The use of cgi or html chat scripts or pages is strictly prohibited. LTTF.com reserves the right to suspend accounts without notice to clients who violate these terms. LTTF.com has sole discretion over what constitutes excessive usage.
Programs provided by LTTF.com as an installable feature are not exempt from this policy. While every effort is made on LTTF.com ‘s end to ensure the program it provides are efficient, problems with excessive usage on particular programs may occur.
Note: LTTF.com may at any time, revise the Acceptable Uses Policy with advanced notice given to clients. Renewal of services with LTTF.com constitutes acceptance to all modifications to the Acceptable Uses Policy and to the Contract for Services. The Acceptable Uses Policy is only a portion of our service agreement. Clients who sign-up for an account will receive a copy of our service agreement, upon request.
