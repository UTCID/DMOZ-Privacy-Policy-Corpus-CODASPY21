We reserve the right to transfer any information to our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets or a particular division or line of business.
We also reserve the right to access and/or disclose any information as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent necessary to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which SAGE ISLAND deems improper.

Cookies
We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you and to customize your use of the Site. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We may also use web bugs, clear gifs and similar technologies that collect data similar to that collected by a cookie. A cookie file can contain various types of information, including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent or you can flush your browser of cookies from time to time. Note: you may need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions. If you choose to disable cookies or refuse to accept a cookie, you may not be able to utilize all features of the Site.
At times, some of our advertisers and their ad service providers set cookies when you click their advertising banners. While we use cookies in other parts of the Site (as discussed above), cookies received with banner ads are collected by those advertisers and their ad service providers. The advertiser’s privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and SAGE ISLAND is not responsible for the privacy practices of such advertiser or ad service provider.

We are committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put into place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us or information stored on the Site or our servers, will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Site demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

If a parent or guardian learns that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, that child’s parent or guardian should send us a request marked “Privacy — Urgent” to contact@sageisland.com if they would like the information submitted by the child deleted from our database. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
