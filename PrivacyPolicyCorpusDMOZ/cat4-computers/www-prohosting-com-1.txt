ProHosting Web Hosting
ProHosting has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: ProHosting Web Hosting.
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your ISP and to gather broad demographic information.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services.

The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.

This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer data is shared with the advertising companies.
