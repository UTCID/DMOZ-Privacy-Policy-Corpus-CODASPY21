than the jurisdiction you are typically a resident in.
For this reason, we have entered into guarantees to ensure appropriate safeguards. If we
transfer information from the European Union to third parties outside the European Union and
to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data
protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual
Clauses with these parties.

details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure
that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and

By using our websites, you are agreeing that we can use cookies in accordance with this
policy. You can usually change the settings of your browser to modify the permissions you
give to us and third parties for the storing of and gaining access to cookies on your device.
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored in your browsing device (computer, tablet or mobile)
by the websites you are visiting. They help the browser remember stateful information related
to your profile during your browsing session or between sessions. Only the website that
provided you with a cookie has the ability to read it.
What are Cookies used for?
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our websites are being used,
letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally
improving your browsing experience.
What types of cookies are used by BitRock?
The types of cookies used on our site can generally be put into one of the following
categories: authentication; analytics; functionality; and social media. You can find
out more about each of the cookie categories in the table below.
Authentication Cookies: These cookies work in conjunction with the login and
authentication mechanisms of our websites. When you are authenticated, they are essential
to make our websites work as intended and enable you to use the features specific to
your account profile. Without these cookies, you would not be able to use these
services whilst authenticated.
Analytics Cookies:
These cookies collect information about how people are using our websites, for
example which pages are visited most often, how people are moving from one link to
another and if a particular user experiences error messages on certain pages. All
information these cookies collect is grouped together with information from other
people's use of our websites. Overall, these cookies provide us with analytical information
about how our websites are performing and how we can improve them. Although Analytics Cookies
may be used by third parties for advertising purposes, they are not per se advertising cookies.

These cookies allow us to remember choices you make and tailor our websites to provide
enhanced features and content to you. For example, these cookies can be used to remember
your IP address, language choice, geolocation and requested Services.
Social Media Cookies:

third party social media service providers such as Facebook or Twitter. Through
these tools or applications, the social media service provider may set its own cookies
on your device. We do not control these cookies and you should check the social media
service provider's website for further details about how they use cookies.
How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a

browsing device by third parties when you visit our websites. Third parties setting cookies
from our websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do
not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use cookies to
help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising
to you that is relevant to your interests. The advertising industries in the EU have developed a
scheme to help you opt-out of receiving cookies used for these purposes. You can find out

Google Analytics:
We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our
websites or use our Service on your browser or mobile device. Google Analytics facilitates
the assignment of data, sessions and interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous
user ID and thus the analysis of activities across devices. We share a unique identifier,
like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. The generated
information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As IP
anonymization is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within the
Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted
to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser
in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. Google will use the
collected data on our behalf to evaluate the use of the websites, to compile reports on
website activity and to provide the website operator with other services related to website
and Internet use.
For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can
control information sent to Google, review Google's site
https://policies.google.com/?hl=en.
You can learn about Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs, including the Google
Analytics Browser Ad-On here

Hotjar:
Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users' experience (e.g.
how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do
and don't like, etc.) and this enables us to maintain and improve our service according
to the use of our websites. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data
on our users' behavior and their devices (in particular device's IP address (captured
and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers),
browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to
display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile.
Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to
match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see

We use Pardot to monitor visitor activities on the Bitnami Stacksmith landing pages.
Pardot sets cookies on your browser to remember preferences (like form field values)
when you return to our site. Pardot also sets a cookie for logged-in users to maintain
the session and remember table filters. Pardot sets first-party cookies for tracking
purposes and sets third-party cookies for redundancy. Using first-party and third-party
cookies together is standard in the marketing automation industry. Pardot cookies do
not store personally identifying information, only a unique identifier. Pardot sets
first-party cookies on our tracker subdomains and Pardot domains.
