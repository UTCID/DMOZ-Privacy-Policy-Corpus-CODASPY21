Virtual Data Protection Officer (vDPO)
Tevora vDPO practitioners serve as a strategic partner to
ensure your organization is GDPR compliant.
Unless your business actively collects and processes EU citizen data as a vital economic activity, a full-time vDPO is not a necessity. You can rely upon the services of our vDPO practitioners that are available to you when you need it.
At Tevora, our team will work carefully with you to understand your organization and environment and develop a custom plan that addresses your long-term needs. While GDPR compliance can be daunting to meet at first glance, our vDPOs will let you function at pace, strategically and with the assurance of compliance.
