Transferring books of business, company sales & reorganisations
The purchase by ERS of reinsurance coverage and reinsurance claims. This relates to large losses only
Disclosing and sharing your information:
To assess the terms of your insurance contract, or to deal with any claims, we may need to share information like your name, address, date of birth and details such as medical conditions or criminal convictions. The recipients of this information could include (but are not limited to) credit reference agencies, anti-fraud databases, other insurers, underwriters and other group companies who provide administration or support services. For claims handling, the recipients could include (but are not limited to) external claims handlers, loss adjusters, courts, legal and other expert advisers, and third parties who are involved in the claim. For reinsurance, recipients include reinsurance brokers, reinsurers and legal advisers. More information about these disclosures is set out below.
The Data Protection laws classify information about your medical conditions, disabilities and criminal convictions as ‘special category’ personal data which warrants extra protection. We will only share this kind of personal data where it is essential to administer your insurance contract or deal with any claims, or for anti-fraud purposes or for reinsurance matters.
Accepting and Administering Your Policy
If you pay your premiums via a credit facility, we may share your information with credit reference agencies and other companies for use in credit decisions, to prevent fraud and to find people who owe money. We share information with other insurers, certain government organisations and other authorised organisations. We may verify driving licence and vehicle information with the DVLA and may check No Claims records against an external database.
If you ask us to transfer your policy to another broker, we will disclose details of your policy (including any other people covered by the policy), any claims made and any other related information to the new broker at your request.
Insurance underwriting
We look at the possible risk in relation to your prospective policy (or anyone else involved in the policy) so that we can:
Consider whether to accept a risk;
Make decisions about providing and dealing with insurance and other related services for you and members of your household;
Set price levels for your policy;
Confirm your identity to prevent money laundering; and
Check the claims history for you or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or a claim at any time. We may do this:
When you apply for or change your insurance;
If there is an accident or a claim; or
At the time you renew the policy.
Profiling
When calculating insurance premiums, we may compare your personal details against industry averages. Your personal information may also be used to create the industry averages going forwards. This is known as profiling and is used to ensure premiums reflect risk. Profiling may also be used to assess the information you provide so we can understand risk patterns.
Special categories of personal data may be used for profiling where this is relevant, such as medical history or past motoring convictions (including motoring offences). We may also make some decisions (for example about whether to offer cover or what the premiums will be) without any intervention by our staff. These are known as automated decisions. We rely on the information you provide to your broker and you can discuss the outcome of any automated decisions with your broker. See “Your Rights” below for further information.Motor Insurance Database
Information about your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) which is managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). Certain government or authorised organisations including the police, the DVLA, the DVLNI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other organisations allowed by law may use the MID and the information stored on it for purposes including:
Continuous Insurance Enforcement (you can get information about this from the Department of Transport);
Electronic vehicle licensing;
Law enforcement for the purposes of preventing, detecting, catching or prosecuting offenders; and
Providing government services or other services aimed at reducing the level of uninsured driving.
If you are involved in a road-traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers or the MIB (or both) may search the MID to gather relevant information. Anyone making a claim for a road-traffic accident (including their appointed representatives and citizens of other countries) may also gather relevant information which is held on the MID.
It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is not shown correctly on the MID, you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police. You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at www.askmid.com.You can find out more about how the MIB uses personal information here:
Managing claims
If you make a claim, we may need to release information to another person or organisation involved in that claim. This includes, but is not restricted to, your broker, your legal representative, others involved in the incident, their insurer, their solicitor or representative and medical teams, authorised repairers, the police or other investigators. We may have to investigate your current claim and your claim and conviction history. This may involve external claims handlers, loss adjusters, legal and other expert advisers.
Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not result in a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to centrally managed claims registers which are operated on behalf of the insurance industry.
Call Recording
You should note that some telephone calls may be recorded or monitored, either by us, for example calls to or from our claims department, customer services team and underwriting department, or  on our behalf by our third party suppliers.  Call recording and monitoring may be carried out for the following purposes:
training and quality control;
as evidence of conversations; and/or
for the prevention or detection of crime (e.g. fraudulent claims).
Preventing or detecting fraud and other criminal offences
We will check your information against a range of registers and databases for completeness and accuracy. We may also conduct searches of publicly available sources of information including social media to verify claims and detect and prosecute fraud. We may share your information with law enforcement agencies, legal advisers, investigators, other organisations and public bodies.
If we find that false or inaccurate information has been given to us, or we suspect fraud, we will take appropriate action. If fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies including the Claims Underwriting Exchange (CUE), the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register (MIAFTR) run by the Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB) and the Insurance Fraud Register (IFR) run by the Insurance Fraud Bureau. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.
We and other organisations, including those from other countries, may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:
Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;
Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;
Recovering debt;
Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance;
Checking details of job applicants and employees.
Details of the registers, databases and fraud prevention agencies we use may be requested from the Company Secretary at:
ERS Insurance Group Limited, 21 Lombard Street, London, EC3V 9AH.
Cheat line
To protect our policyholders, we are members of the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB). If you suspect insurance fraud is being committed, you can call them on their confidential cheat line on 0800 422 0421.
Consent and the Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information
Most of the personal information you provide to us is needed for us to assess your request for insurance, to enter into the insurance contract with you and then to administer that contract. Some of the information is collected for fraud prevention purposes, as described above.
If we need your consent to use any specific information, we will make that clear at the time we collect the information from you. You are free to withhold your consent or withdraw it at any time, but if you do so it may impact upon our ability to provide insurance or pay claims.
Further details about the legal basis for our processing of personal information, and the disclosures we may make, can be found in the Appendix below. Suppliers
Like most organisations, ERS uses a variety of companies to provide services on our behalf. We enter into contracts with those service providers to make sure they protect your personal information using appropriate security measures and we prohibit them from using your personal data other than as instructed by us.
Below is a list of service providers that have access to personal information to help service policies and subsequent claims:
Third Parties
Reason
Brokers
Brokers are the interface between ERS and policyholders. They
provide information to ERS about policyholders, named drivers and other
relevant individuals and we may share information with them about claims.
Some of our brokers are located in Jersey, Guernsey and/or Isle of Man.
Insurance Software Houses
Software houses operate a trading platform which brokers
can use to obtain quotations and insurance premiums for policies underwritten
by insurers such as ERS.
Fraud Organisations
We share data with fraud organisations to meet our
regulatory requirements and to protect ERS, our policyholders and claimants.
This includes various providers used to support pricing decisions.
Fraud Investigators
Where additional information is required in relation to a
reported or alleged incident, we may instruct claims investigators to carry
out additional services such as interviews, reports and evidence review in
order to validate the information presented. They need access to personal
details to conduct a thorough investigation.
Out of Hours Suppliers
These are contracted parties to handle claims notification
and indemnity enquiries outside of the ERS normal operating hours. They may have
remote access to ERS Policy and Claims systems.
Claims Suppliers (Repairers, Engineers, Salvage Agents,
Loss Adjusters, etc.)
These providers service claims as outlined in the
insurance policy. The third party will need access to personal details to
allow the claim to be reviewed and concluded.
Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB)
Motor Insurers have a regulatory requirement to submit
some personal information about policyholders to the Motor Insurance Database
(MID).
Administrative Support
ERS employs third party suppliers to manage inbound and
outbound correspondence (i.e. scanning, referencing post, cheque processing, printing
and postal services) and other administrative tasks. One of our

reinsurers. We may share information with them regarding ERS’ policy summary
data and large losses specifically when dealing with reinsurance claims.
Reinsurers
Reinsurers provide reinsurance cover to ERS to protect
against material losses. This practice of spreading risk is standard practice
in the insurance market. They are provided with information regarding ERS’ policy
summary data only and large losses specifically when dealing with reinsurance
claims.
International Transfers
Some of the partner organisations and service providers we work with may be located in other countries. ERS uses service providers located in the USA, India and Israel. As a result, your information may be processed outside the European Economic Area. In all cases we will make sure that your information is adequately protected.
If you travel abroad, your information may need to be transferred to or from other countries in order to administer your insurance and deal with any claims, for example to provide recovery and repatriation services if your vehicle breaks down or you have an accident in another country.
Any other transfers of personal information outside Europe will be subject to the provisions of the US Privacy Shield, standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or other contracts which provide equivalent protection.
Other Disclosures
In addition to the disclosures described elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may also disclose your personal information in the following circumstances: (i) if required by law; (ii) in connection with a reorganisation, sale or transfer of all or any part of our business; (iii) if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to enforce or apply the terms of our contracts or otherwise to exercise or defend our rights; (iv) in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal obligation, or a regulatory or government inquiry.
Retention
We will keep your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. In particular, we will retain your information for as long as there is any possibility that either you or we may wish to bring a legal claim under or relating to your insurance, or where we are required to keep your information for legal or regulatory purposes. We have various different retention periods for different types of claims and other records. If you would like more information about this, please contact us at the address shown below.
We may keep anonymised data for longer periods for analysis and modelling purposes.

You have rights under the Data Protection laws including the right to access the information we hold about you and receive a copy of that information (subject to any legal restrictions that may apply), to have the information corrected if it is inaccurate, and to have it updated if it is incomplete.
You can also find out about any automated decisions we make that affect your insurance or premiums.

We will ask your permission before carrying out any marketing. You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing at any time. You can use the unsubscribe option that is included in all our marketing emails or contact us using the details given below.
In very limited circumstances and only where you have given us your express consent, we may pass your data to a third party so that they can contact you for marketing purposes. In such circumstances we will act as data processor in collecting your consent and sending it to the third party, and the third party will be the data controller in respect of the relevant data.
