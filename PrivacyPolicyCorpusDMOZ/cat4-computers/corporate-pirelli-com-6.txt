Sustainability
Main sustainability policiesHealth, safety and environment policy
Protecting people’s health, safety and welfare and protecting the
environment are core values of the Pirelli Group in conducting and
developing its activities.
Pirelli’s strategies for
sustainable development pursue continuous improvement in environmental,
occupational health and safety and welfare related aspects, in
accordance with the Company’s Values and Ethical Code and in compliance
with
the Sustainability Model envisaged by the United Nations Global
Compact.
The Company pursues the goals of reduction of
environmental impact of Group operations and of
“zero injuries to
people” through the prompt identification, assessment and prevention
of
environmental risks promptly putting in place remedy actions in case
such events occur.
Pirelli promotes its culture of safety at work and protection of the environment with its Stakeholders,
with a focus on its supply chain, and actively collaborates on a
national and international level with institutional and academic
institutions.
The activities and performances recorded are
reported periodically through the Group's annual report and the
corporate website. Pirelli also provides its Stakeholders with a
dedicated channel (the “Group Whistleblowing Policy-Complaint Procedure”
published on the Pirelli website) for reporting any situation, also
anonymous, that
poses or could pose a risk to the health, safety or
welfare of individuals as well as for the protection of the environment.
The commitments mentioned above are duly declined in the Policy Health, Safety and Environment.
