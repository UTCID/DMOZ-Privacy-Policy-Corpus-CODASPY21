Privacy Policy
Your privacy is of the utmost importance to Delphi Forums. Because we
ask for some basic personal information during registration, we want you
to be fully informed of how this information is gathered and used.
Registration
Some basic personal information is required in order to register with
Delphi Forums:
Email Address - By providing your email address, you can receive
important messages via your existing email account. Message board notifications,
personalized My Forums newsletters, and messages sent to you by other
Delphi Forums members rely on the email address you provide when you
register.
Delphi Forums does not share your email address with other members,
forum hosts, or third parties.
User Name - This is how you are identified when you participate
in forums. While many other aspects of your account can be updated
regularly, your user name cannot be changed.
Your User Name can be seen by other
members.
Children
No children under 13 are allowed to participate in Delphi Forums.
Cookies
Delphi Forums uses cookies to customize your experience while using
our services. A cookie is a small text file that many Web sites
write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be
read by the site that places it, so Delphi Forums can't learn about your
browsing history based
on any other cookies in your browser. Most
browsers also allow the option of displaying a warning before accepting
a cookie, or refusing all cookies. Declining cookies while participating
in forums may result in some of features not working properly.
Cookies are used on Delphi Forums to verify your login information, and
to optionally store your password in your browser so that you do not need
to type it in each time you visit. Any time that you point your browser
to a 'members-only' area, Delphi Forums checks your browser's cookie file
to see if you have already logged in, and if you have, you're taken right
to the page that you have requested. If not, you'll be directed to the
Delphi Forums login screen, where you can quickly and easily login to your
account, or signup for Delphi Forums if you are not yet a member.
Advertising
Delphi Forums uses third-party advertising companies and advertising
networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site.
These companies may use information about your visits to this and other
Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
of interest to you (if you would like more information about this practice
and to know your choices about not having this information used by these
companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
Personally identifiable information such as your name or email
address are not shared with advertisers.
Among the third-party advertising companies that Delphi Forums uses
are Google. For more information on
their privacy policies, please consult the Google
ad and content network privacy policy.
Delphi Forums also uses technology from VigLink to augment links to certain online merchants.
Please see the VigLink disclosure
statement for more information.
Public Forums
Delphi Forums hosts message boards, chat and other services for both
public and private forums. Please remember that any information that is
disclosed in public forums becomes public information. In addition, information
that is disclosed in private forums may be disclosed by other forum participants.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Security
Delphi Forums' site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under its control. Delphi Forums'
servers have strict security in place to prevent an intruder from retrieving
personal information about its users.
Termination
You can elect to terminate your membership with Delphi Forums at any
time. Simply go to your My
Preferences page, scroll down to Account Status, and click the Close Account button. Upon termination, your account information
will not necessarily be removed entirely from Delphi Forums - this
is to reserve your identity so that no one else can create a new account
with your membername or email address, and also allows you the privilege
of reactivating your account at a later date if you wish to use Delphi
Forums again. The termination of your Delphi Forums membership will not
automatically terminate any affiliated memberships or registrations you
have formed through Delphi Forums. If, after having joined a Delphi partner's
service, you wish to be removed, you should contact that service directly
to have your membership terminated.
Summary
In this electronic era, when personal information can easily
be obtained through various sources, Delphi appreciates the sensitivity
of any private information that you disclose to us. It is our intention
to treat your account information with the highest level of care.
