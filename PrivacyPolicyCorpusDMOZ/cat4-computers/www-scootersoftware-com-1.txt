Scooter Software encourages users who want to participate in the Scooter Software support forums to register.
In order to register, you must provide us with a username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid email address.

When you register, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL.
This optional information is made available to other bulletin or message board users to foster a sense of community.
If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed.

This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
