1.1
From time to time, we may offer a special discount offer so users can access and try out particular premium / paid features or other features and content of one of our products for certain periods of time as determined by us. Special discount offers are made available by EnigmaSoft Limited to eligible new and former users. Specific terms and conditions (including pricing and duration) relating to the discount offer may appear on our website, during sign-up, or in other messages/correspondence we send. All of these terms and conditions relating to the discount offer are incorporated by reference into your Agreement with us and are legally binding.
1.2
By using a special discount offer you: (a) acknowledge and agree to our End User License Agreement, our Privacy Policy, these Special Discount Offer Terms and our other terms and policies, which are all set out on our website www.enigmasoftware.com; and (b) consent to use of the information you submit to us in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
1.3
The special discount offer starts when you activate the offer. If you do not want to continue with any premium / paid features you must cancel your paid subscription before the end of any offer period. We will bill your preferred payment method for the application subscription fee at the end of the offer period on a recurring basis if you do not cancel your subscription before the end of the offer period.
1.4
We reserve the right to determine eligibility for the discount offer in our sole discretion. To activate any offer you may need to submit certain information we require at sign-up. We may use information such as address, email, payment information, device identifier, hardware ID, and IP address to help us determine eligibility.
1.5
If you have an existing or recent subscription to a product or service you are not eligible for this discount offer. To help prevent abuse we may limit the duration of the discount offer or limit eligibility. If we determine that abuse is occurring or that a user is not eligible, we may revoke the discount offer and suspend a user’s access to our products and services. In our discretion, we may withdraw, cancel, or change the content or features of a discount offer (or these special discount offer terms) at any time by providing notice and without liability to you.
1.6
You may only benefit from the special discount offer once. Discount offers are personal and are non-transferable. You cannot redeem discount offers for cash. Discount offers are available for the time periods set by us in our sole discretion. Discount offers cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer and may not be available to all users in all regions or all countries.
