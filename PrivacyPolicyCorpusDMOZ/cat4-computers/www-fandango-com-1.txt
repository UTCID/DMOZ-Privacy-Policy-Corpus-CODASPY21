Why can't I find a theater in the Flixster App?
Check if your theater filter settings are set to "Show: TICKETING" by navigating to the top of the theater tab. Tap "Show: TICKETING" and update your filter to "ALL THEATERS". If you still can’t find the theater, Flixster may not support that theater.
