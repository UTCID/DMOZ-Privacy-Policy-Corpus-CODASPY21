Get More With A Membership
At Shape5 we are dedicated to saving you money! We sell memberships instead of individual products. With a membership you can download any or all products in a club, as many times as you want, all for the same price that most companies charge for just one single product! This means if you decide to change to different design later, you can do this without having to purchase a brand new design every time.
What if you could setup four websites for only $22 each? That is cheaper than most developers charge for a single theme or template. Our Best Value Membership does just this! For just $89 you can configure up to four sites using our designs, which equals to an incredibly low price of only $22 per website!
Note - A membership is not a subscription service. All products work as normal once your membership expires, and there are no automatic renewals.
