Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management profile. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.

Arbitration
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY.
17.1. Binding Arbitration
Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company: (a) waive your right to have any and all disputes or Claims arising from these Terms or Mammoth HR (collectively, "Disputes") resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
17.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND THE COMPANY AND THAT SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NEITHER PARTY AGREES TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR TO AN ARBITRATION IN WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. FURTHER, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT A DISPUTE CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS.
17.3. Federal Arbitration Act
You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 shall be governed by, construed and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA") to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
17.4. Process
You and the Company agree that you will notify each other in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the Company receives your notice, either you or the Company may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and the Company agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Company agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute). You and the Company agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Multnomah County, Oregon, or in the county in which you reside; (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in Oregon will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration.

17.6. Rules of JAMS
The rules of, and additional information about, JAMS are available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/, as may be updated from time to time. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
17.7. Severability
If any provision of this Section 17 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law and all other provisions will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 17.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable except as prohibited by applicable law.
17.8. Opt-Out Right
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 17 by writing to: Mammoth HR, Attn: Chief Financial Officer, 625 SW Broadway, Suite 300, Portland, Oregon 97205. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes on an individual basis in accordance with Section 18.
18. Applicable Law and Venue
These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Oregon, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the arbitration provision in Section 17 does not apply (if ever), you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon, and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.19. Termination
