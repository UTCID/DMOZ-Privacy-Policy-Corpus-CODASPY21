About GUIDs
Globally Unique Identifiers, or GUIDs, are long unique numbers that programs on your computer can generate. These numbers are designed to let programs use shared resources without conflicts, but have also been used to confirm a known GUID was produced by a specific computer. The software program GetBot only uses GUIDs as a part of Windows, and does not record them or transmit them over the Internet.
