5. CHARGES.  By electing to purchase subscription-based services, you warrant that all information you submit is true and accurate (including without limitation your credit card number and expiration date) and you agree to pay all subscription fees you incur plus all applicable taxes.   a. Payment of your account balance is due annually and must be made by the credit card designated by you or as an ACH (direct debit to your checking account).   b. Charges are to be paid on an annual basis. If the payment method for your account is not received from the card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. Each time you use the Service, or allow or cause the Service to be used, you agree and reaffirm that the Company is authorized to charge your designated card. Your card issuer’s agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Service, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You agree that the Company may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each cycle, and that the Company may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer until submission of the accumulated charge(s).

Your activation fee (if applicable) and recurring service fees are payable in advance and are COMPLETELY NON-REFUNDABLE. You agree that the Company may submit charges for annual service fee each year, without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before the Company reasonably could act on your notice. (Note: the Company takes no responsibility for contacting you prior to charging your designated credit card for your recurring service fee.) If you have any question regarding any charges that have been applied to your account, you must contact the Company’s Customer Service Department within 30 days of the charge date. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for refusing to pay any charges submitted by the Company in accordance with this Agreement. d. You must promptly notify the Company of changes to: (a) the account number or expiration date of your designated card; (b) your billing address. You must also promptly notify the Company if your card is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft). e. FREE TRIALS – The Company may offer a Free Trial month as part of some promotions.

Activation fees (if applicable) will be charged at the beginning of the subscriber’s first paid month.
6. PAYMENT. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Service account without notice upon rejection of any card charges or if your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to the Company when the Company believes you are liable for the charge.
