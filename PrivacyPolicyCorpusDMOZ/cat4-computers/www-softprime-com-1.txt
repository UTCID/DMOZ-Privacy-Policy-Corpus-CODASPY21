Privacy Policy
At SoftPrime Development we respect your privacy. We will not sell, share,
or rent any data collected on our site to others in ways different from
what is disclosed in this statement. Any and all information collected
through our system is treated with the utmost care.
Personal Information
SoftPrime Development collects basic contact information when you subscribe
to our newsletter or fill in a contact form. This information is used to contact
you about the services on our site for which you have expressed
interest or reply to a query and will not be shared with our partners
or any third parties. Personal information is stored on SoftPrime Development
computers and is accessed by authorized personnel only.
Cookies
SoftPrime Development uses a cookie to store your visiting and referrer
information. A cookie is a small text file, stored on your computer's
hard drive, that can be read by our system when you return to our site.
Encrypted Credit Card Purchases
If you use a credit card to purchase a SoftPrime Development product,
the purchaser's name, email address, mailing address, credit card number,
and expiration date are encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This
is necessary for processing and fulfilling orders and providing notification
of the order status. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by
SoftPrime Development or our computers - it is simply passed through to
the credit card processing company. In this respect, buying from SoftPrime
Development is similar to a credit card purchase at any store.
