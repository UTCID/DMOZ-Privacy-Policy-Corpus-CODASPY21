Information Collection and Use
We will never intentionally disclose any personal
identification information about you as an individual user (such as, for
example, your full name, street address, telephone number, credit card
number or e-mail address) to any third party without having received
your permission. We collect two kinds of information from you:
personally-identifiable information that you choose to provide to us and
non personally-identifiable information, such as your IP address.
Personally-Identifiable Information
The only personally-identifiable information that we
collect is what you voluntarily submit to us. For example, if you e-mail
questions or requests for information about Secure Crossing R&D product and services, we may request
your name, mailing address, telephone number and/or e-mail address to
respond to your inquiries.
