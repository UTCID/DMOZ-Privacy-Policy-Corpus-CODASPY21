Consumers'
Privacy Rights
MIDAS
holds the consumer relationship in the highest regard
and pledges:
To ensure that consumers have the ultimate right to
control dissemination of their personal information.
We support the self-regulation efforts of the direct
marketing industry and believe this action is the best
way to protect consumer privacy. We support legislation
and regulatory efforts, which introduce fair, workable
guidelines that protect the privacy of consumers. We
will work to ensure that any such guidelines are consistent
with and complement established self-regulatory measures,
and that they allow the consumer to continue receiving
the benefits that sophisticated marketing techniques
can provide.
To comply with all relevant legislation at all times
and to implement such legislation as required.
To monitor privacy issues and assure that any changes
in legislation or industry standards regarding privacy
issues are reflected in our Privacy Policy. We are in
constant contact with our client Web sites to identify
and resolve misunderstandings about the law, industry
standards or our Privacy Policy and to ensure their
compliance with all self-regulatory and legislative
obligations relating to the use of consumer data.
To work with recognised trade associations and organizations
that support consumer privacy. We actively participate
in the efforts of Europe's Direct Marketing Industry
to establish industry guidelines that safeguard the
individual right to privacy.
To provide services that benefit both consumers and
marketers. Consumers benefit from our services through
the realisation of lower prices that result from the
marketers' more efficient communications approach. In
addition, consumers realise savings in time and expense
by being able to shop via the Internet. Marketers can
better tailor their products and services to meet the
needs of their customers with our assistance. Further,
they can refine their promotional efforts to target
only those customers for whose benefit the products
have been produced.

provide it on subsequent visits to that area.

this information to research and understand how our
user's habits are similar or different so that we can

laws to the UK, or no data protection laws.
