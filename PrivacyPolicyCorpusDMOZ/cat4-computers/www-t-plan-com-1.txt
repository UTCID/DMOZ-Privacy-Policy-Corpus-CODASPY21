Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

Analytics
T-Plan collects data and analyses this activity via Google Analytics, visitor forensics solutions (WhoIsVisiting , Lead Forensics) and Yoast SEO. T-Plan does not personally or directly identify you when you visit our website. This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you browse, or your location information associated with your IP Address. We use this information we collect for marketing purposes in establishing statistics on user traffic on our website.
With each visit to our website we may automatically collect the following information:
Technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet, time zone setting, browser types and versions, operating system and platform.

Who we share your data with
T-Plan only uses information as defined in this policy, this means we will never sell, trade or otherwise share your identifiable or anonymised information.

Identifiable information includes information which can be used to identify you. Examples of identifiable information are your name, email address, your address and phone number.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
We intend to retain data from contacts until they revoke that privilege. Customer data will be stored for a maximum of 5 years in order to comply with requirements around reporting and accounting, but also in order to provide customers with data on previous engagements etc.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.
If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.
Google Web Fonts
For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our plugin. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.
