Password Policy Enforcement
Password Policy Enforcement
Require users to choose hard-to-guess passwords, preventing password reuse and forcing regular password changes.
When users select a new password with Hitachi ID Bravura Pass -- either using its
web portal or by changing their password natively on a system that has
been configured to trigger transparent password synchronization,
Bravura Pass applies a site-defined set of password quality rules.
Users are not allowed to select passwords that violate this policy.
The policy mechanism supports over 50 types of rules, including an
unlimited-length history, word and permutation checks against various
dictionaries and checks against the user ID and its permutations.
Regular expression matching is also supported so that Hitachi ID Systems customer
can define its own rules if they are not supported in Bravura Pass.
When using the Bravura Pass web portal, password policy rules are
displayed to the user on the screen where users are prompted to select
a new password.
Rule violations, if any, are detailed on the subsequent
screen.
On most systems, where transparent password synchronization is
configured, there is no way for Bravura Pass to display either password
composition rules or informative messages about why a given password
was rejected to the user.
This is due to limitations in the native OS
or application mechanism available to Bravura Pass to intercept password
changes, rather than a limitation in Bravura Pass itself.
Messages about
why a given password was rejected can still be communicated, but only
via a side channel, such as e-mail or SMS.
Learn more about the
password strength rules
that Bravura Pass can enforce.
A Global Policy
Bravura Pass is normally configured to enforce a uniform
password policy across all systems, to ensure that any new password
will be acceptable to every integrated system. This provides the most
clear and understandable experience to users. Bravura Pass is configured
such that it will never accept or propagate a password that will not
meet this global password policy.
For instance, in the case of an organization that has both Windows
Active Directory (AD) and z/OS passwords, where users may enter
very long passwords on AD but only 8 characters on the mainframe,
Bravura Pass can require that passwords be exactly 8 characters long.
Alternately, Bravura Pass can support longer passwords, but truncate them
when it updates the mainframe (users generally prefer a fixed
length, as it is easier to understand).
All systems enforce two types of password rules:
Complexity requirements ensure that users do not select
easily-guessed passwords. Example rules are: disallowing
any permutation of the user's login ID, password history,
requiring mixed letters and digits, forbidding dictionary
words, etc.
Character set and length limits on what can be physically stored
in the password field on a given system.
A global password policy is normally created by combining and
strengthening the best-of-breed complexity requirements from each
system affected by the policy. Bravura Pass then combines these with the
most restrictive storage constraints.
This forces users
to select strong, secure passwords on every system.
The alternative, of defining different password policies for
every target system or for groups of target systems, is less
user friendly.
To update their passwords, users must select a
system, choose a password, wait for the password update to complete,
choose another system, select and input a different
password, etc.
Users must then remember multiple passwords and will
continue to experience many password problems.
It has been shown that
users with many passwords have a strong tendency to write down their
passwords.
Support for Incompatible Policies
Normally, it is desirable to have a single, global password policy.
This makes the user experience much simpler and encourages high
user adoption.
In some cases, it is impossible to formulate a single, consistent
password policy that works across two different systems.
Typically this
happens when one system requires strong security and complex passwords,
while another system simply cannot support complex passwords.
Examples of weak systems include legacy applications that use very
short passwords or numeric PINs, voice mail passwords, etc.
Systems with a moderate password complexity capability typically
include mainframes and database servers.
Systems with a strong password complexity capability typically include
Active Directory, LDAP directories and modern implementations of Unix.
If some systems have mutually exclusive password complexity
capabilities, they can be grouped into mutually-compatible sets,
and each set of systems is configured in its own Bravura Pass target group.
Note that multiple Bravura Pass target groups can co-exist on a single
Bravura Pass instance and do not require separate maintenance.
Configuration
is just a few minutes.
Each Bravura Pass target group can support its own set of
password policies, as well as policies regarding transparent
password synchronization.
When users choose to change their passwords, they must first
select a target group in the Bravura Pass user interface.
Subsequently,
appropriate policy information is displayed and enforced.
Clearly, it is preferable to formulate a single password policy
for all systems whenever possible, to eliminate the password complexity
which Bravura Pass is designed to address in the first place.
List of Rules
Following is a list of password strength rules that can be
enforced by Bravura Pass:
Rule name
Type
Description

Require mixed case?
Req/Warn
Enable if passwords should contain both uppercase and lowercase
characters.
Maximum no. of lower-case letters
Req/Warn
The largest number of lower-case letters that a legal password
can contain.
Maximum no. of upper-case letters
Req/Warn

can contain.
Maximum no. of punctuation marks
Req/Warn
The largest number of punctuation marks that a legal password can
