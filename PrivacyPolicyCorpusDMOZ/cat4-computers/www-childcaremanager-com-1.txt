At PerSoft, we are dedicated to revolutionizing the way professional childcare providers manage their businesses. To that end, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines.
Visiting PerSoft Online
When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other websites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information that can be used to enhance the products and services we provide you. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect the information that you share with us. This policy governs websites owned and operated by Personalized Software. Our policy does not govern websites of other parties to which we may provide links, because Personalized Software is not responsible for the Web privacy practices or content of those sites.
Our Philosophy & Practice

Information Collected on Our Website
Our Web server automatically attempts to collect general, non-personally identifiable information for each visitor to our site. This information may include the name of the visitor’s domain, the pages visited, and from which site the visitor came.
Certain pages on our website, including requests for evaluation software and product literature, prompt users to enter information into an online form. This information is used by Personalized Software for the purpose of satisfying customer requests.
Billing information collected for orders using online ordering is collected to process the order. Visitors will be asked to re-enter this information each time they visit the site. For security reasons, Personalized Software does not save it with personally identifiable information.

Credit card information is used only for the purpose of processing an order. Personalized Software will never use this information for other purposes.
