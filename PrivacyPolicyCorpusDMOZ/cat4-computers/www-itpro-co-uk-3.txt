By the 16th September, Microsoft had been alerted and had encrypted the server once more.The team believes that anyone who had used Bing's mobile app for internet searches between the 10th and 16th September may have had their data leaked online.Researchers also believe that during this period the database was subject to what's known as a "meow" attack – an automated attack that targets unsecured Elasticsearch servers and destroys huge volumes of data without explanation or reason.Server & storagedatabasesweb browserdata protectioncloud securityShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare via EmailFeatured ResourcesThree key steps to delivering data-driven marketingGo further with data management in your marketing effortsDownload nowHow to take infrastructure monitoring to the next levelThe four imperatives for building true observabilityDownload nowGo further with mobile marketingEasy steps to get your mobile strategy up-to-speedDownload nowMLOps 101: The foundation for your AI strategyWhat is MLOps and why do you need an MLOps infrastructure?Download nowRecommendedData: A resource much too valuable to leave unprotectedWhitepaperData: A resource much too valuable to leave unprotected2 Dec 2020Webhose and Signal Corp boost data breach detectionSecurityWebhose and Signal Corp boost data breach detection7 Oct 2020ICO to relax GDPR enforcement during coronavirus economic downturnGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)ICO to relax GDPR enforcement during coronavirus economic downturn16 Apr 2020The NHS teams up with Apple and Google on coronavirus tracking appprivacyThe NHS teams up with Apple and Google on coronavirus tracking app14 Apr 2020Most PopularZero-click 'wormable' RCE flaw uncovered in Microsoft Teams SecurityZero-click 'wormable' RCE flaw uncovered in Microsoft Teams 8 Dec 2020Russian hackers are exploiting critical VMware flawsSecurityRussian hackers are exploiting critical VMware flaws8 Dec 2020Why flexibility is key for businessSponsoredWhy flexibility is key for business24 Nov 2020Skip to HeaderSkip to Content
