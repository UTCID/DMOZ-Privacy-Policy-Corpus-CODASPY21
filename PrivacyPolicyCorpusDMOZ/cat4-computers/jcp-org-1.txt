JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS WEB SITE TERMS OF USE
1. INTRODUCTION. This Site and its contents are made available on behalf of Oracle
Corporation, Inc. including its successors-in-interest, if any ("Host"). These
Terms of Use ("Terms") apply to everyone who Uses this Site (as defined below)
except, if you are party to a current, in-force Java Specification
Participation Agreement with Oracle (JSPA), then these Terms do not apply to
activities that
are within the subject matter of such JSPA. In addition, these Terms do not
apply to Java Specifications, Reference Implementations ("RIs") or Technology
Compatibility Kits ("TCKs"), whether or not as final releases, that are made
available under license through web pages that are linked to these Terms. THIS
DOCUMENT IS A LEGAL CONTRACT, PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY FIRST. BY USING THE SITE
OR MATERIALS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THE TERMS AND AGREE TO THEM.
IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL
ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE LEGAL
ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT WISH
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE THE SITE OR MATERIALS.
2. ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS. In addition to capitalized terms defined as they
appear in the body of these Terms, as used here:
a. "Materials" means source code, code samples, object code, technical
materials, documentation, discussion thread postings, blogs, wikis, data, and
any other content, information, technology or services available on the Site.
b. "Site" means the collection of JCP web pages from which these Terms of Use
are linked, or that prompt or require Users to view or accept these Terms
before accessing such pages, as well as any successor web pages or other
technology as may be designated by the Hosts.
c. "Submissions" means any Materials submitted to the Site; provided, however,
that Submissions do not include any "Contributions" made pursuant to a JSPA as
the term "Contribution" is used therein.
d. "Use" and its variants are meant in their broadest sense, including, but not
limited to, the acts of using, accessing, receiving, browsing, downloading
from, and uploading to. A "User" is a person or entity who Uses the Site.
e. "You" means you personally, as well as any person or entity on whose behalf
you are Using the Site.
3. ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THINGS YOU FIND HERE. This section refers to the
Materials found on the Site, as defined above.
a. Materials May Have Other Licenses/Terms. Some of the Materials, for example
Java Specifications, RIs and TCKs, may be accompanied by their own licenses or
terms of use. With respect to Your rights in and obligations regarding such
Materials (but not including Your Submissions which are governed by Section 4.b
below), and to the extent there is a conflict, those licenses or terms of use
take precedence over these Terms, and you agree to be bound accordingly.
b. Use at Your Own Risk. You understand that the Host may or may not pre-screen
Materials, and You agree to assume all risks in Using them. These risks
include, but are not limited to, errors, viruses, worms, time-limited software
that expires without notice, defamatory or offensive content, and the
possibility that the Materials infringe or misappropriate the intellectual
property rights of others. You agree to assume all such risks. If Host becomes
aware of Submissions that violate these Terms or that Host believes to be
obscene, lewd, lascivious, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise
objectionable, they may act in good faith to restrict access to or availability
of the material. If You
notice that any other User's Submissions appear to violate these Terms, or if
any other User makes You feel harassed or unsafe, You agree to contact us
immediately.
c. Don't Blame the Messenger. You understand that Materials may contain the
opinions of others and You do not hold the Host responsible for such opinions.
d. Management of Materials and Access. You agree that the Host has sole
discretion in deciding whether to accept and post Materials, and that it may
delete Materials for any reason (including no reason) whatsoever. You
understand that access to the Site may be limited for technical reasons, that
outages may occur, and that the Hosts have no obligation to store or back up
any Materials. You agree that the Host has the right to restrict or terminate,
in its sole discretion, access to the Site for any reason, including its belief
that a User has violated these Terms.
