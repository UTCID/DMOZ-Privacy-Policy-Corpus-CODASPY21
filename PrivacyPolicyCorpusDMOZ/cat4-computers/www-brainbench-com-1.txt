Your Account (User Conduct)
To have the ability to access our web site and services, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, it is your responsibility to find the equipment (i.e. computer, modem, and/or other devices) necessary to make such a connection to the Internet.
Brainbench provides access to many aspects of the web site at no cost to the user. In consideration of your use of Brainbench, you agree to: (1) provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form and (2) maintain and promptly update your personal contact information to keep it current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or not current, or if Brainbench has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, or not current, Brainbench has the right to disable or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the site (or any portion thereof).
Once you complete the registration process with Brainbench, you will receive a unique logon ID and password that is associated with your new account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the logon ID and password, and are fully accountable for all activities that occur under your account. You also agree to immediately notify Brainbench of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.
You understand that all information, such as career information, personal data, text, sound, photographs, graphics, or other materials within your account or transcript, whether publicly posted or privately held within your account or transcript, is your sole responsibility, as you are the person from which this information was generated. This means that you, and not Brainbench, are entirely responsible for all content that you post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available via your account.
You are on your honor to uphold the standards of truth when taking the certification tests on our web site. Cheating is not permitted and will not be accepted. In addition, the practice of copying and sharing certification test questions will not be tolerated. This is in violation of copyright laws and is grounds for termination of your account, prevention of further access to the Brainbench web site, and possible legal action could be brought against you.

Payment, Billing, and Delivery Practices
Payment:
Payment for Brainbench services or products may be made by credit card, certified check, or money order, or other means by which Brainbench authorizes. Payment must be received by Brainbench prior to acceptance of an order. For credit card transactions, the appropriate information is collected and the transaction takes place on a secure, and encrypted server. The information provided is used strictly to process the order and shall not be given out to third parties.
Subscription Options:
Registered users have the added option to purchase two subscription plans with Brainbench to gain access to the Certification Tests. Subscribers will be automatically renewed for the original subscription term (annual or monthly) upon expiration of a subscription unless Brainbench is notified of cancellation prior to expiration date. Subscribers may cancel their subscription on the Brainbench site.
Users also have the ability to upgrade their subscription plan. This can be done online or by contacting the Customer Support Team. If you upgrade from a monthly to an annual plan, the months corresponding to your upgraded plan are added to the remaining time left on your monthly subscription.
Billing:
Your billing cycle will begin when you purchase a monthly or annual subscription. Monthly subscriptions will be billing up front for the first quarter (3 months) and will continue on a monthly basis after that, unless we hear from you that you wish to cancel your monthly subscription. If you purchase a monthly subscription with a certified check or money order, you will need to pay for the first 3 months upfront just like someone paying with a credit card. However, subsequent months will need to be paid in quarterly payments (as opposed to monthly) to avoid any disruption in service. For example, the payment for the next 3 months of service needs to reach us before the expiration of your first 3 months.
The annual subscriber is responsible for paying the subscription fee at the beginning of the subscription. The monthly subscriber is responsible for paying periodic monthly subscription fees according to the then-current billing terms. Subscription fees are non-refundable and can be changed at the sole discretion of Brainbench.
If you are a Special Introductory, or Promotional Offer customer, you will have either free or discounted access to the service for a specified period as advertised at the time. You will be automatically enrolled as a subscriber and your credit card will be billed at the then current subscription rate. Without exception, all promotional offers begin at the conclusion of your first paid subscription period. (For example, if the promotion is one free month if you sign up for an annual subscription, you will receive the free month access beginning on the 13th month following your subscription enrollment.) Standard subscription membership terms and fees will be automatically reinstated immediately upon the expiration of your free, trial, or discounted promotional access period.
Unless and until this agreement is cancelled in accordance with the terms hereof, the annual or monthly subscriber hereby authorizes Brainbench to charge the subscriber's credit card to pay for the ongoing cost of the subscription. The subscribers hereby further authorize Brainbench to charge their credit card for any and all purchases of products and services. Brainbench subscription accounts will expire at 06:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5:00) on the date of expiration.
Accounts which have not been cancelled will be automatically renewed and rebilled at this time.
Customers may not assign or transfer access privileges to any other person or entity. Customers must promptly inform Brainbench of the following: (1) changes in the expiration date of any credit card used in connection with this service; (2) changes in home or billing address; (3) apparent breaches of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of an ID or password. Until Brainbench is notified by e-mail of a breach in security, the customer will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the service.
If a subscriber cancels their subscription, they will continue to receive service until the end of their subscription term.
Delivery:
Delivery of the Brainbench certificates are sent from our mail house distributor in the U.S. Brainbench certificates are sent via standard mail and should be received in weeks (after passing the certification) for US delivery, 6 to 9 for international delivery.
The certificate delivery schedule and shipping times are estimates, and are subject to change without notice.
In the case of certificates that need to be reordered and/or resent, the delivery schedule will apply to the date of the second order.
Brainbench is not responsible for lost or misdirected mail.
Certificate orders are non-refundable.
Refunds:
Brainbench will not offer refunds on valid, properly executed orders. Should you have any inquires regarding a request for a refund, this should be directed to the Customer Support Team. You can also reach them directly Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. ET (GMT-5) at (703) 674-3369.
