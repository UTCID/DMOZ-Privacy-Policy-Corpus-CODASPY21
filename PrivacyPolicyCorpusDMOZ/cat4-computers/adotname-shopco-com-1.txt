Payment Processing, Security and Privacy Statement
Payment Processing Policy
adotname.com processes all transactions through the ShopCo.com payment processing system.
ShopCo.com
uses industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, as well as private links to international banking networks, to ensure your
information is quickly and securely authorized and processed.
Payments made on our site will appear as
"SHOPCO - 8662083122 MS DomainName" on your credit card statement.
Security Policy
Your credit card information is protected in two ways. First of all, as a result of the SSL-based encryption, your card number is
ALWAYS secure during transmission. A visual means of confirming this is for you to watch the small padlock icon in your browser. While on any
page where financial information is to be entered, this icon will change to a locked state, denoting a secure page. This security measure is
privately audited by an independent third-party, Geotrust, whose icon you can click on from any secured page to confirm its secure status.
Secondly, our private links to banking networks ensure that your sensitive information is ALWAYS secure once we have received
it. All the information traveling on our banking network is guaranteed 100% secure.
Shopco actively works with international banking institutions and law enforcement to discover and prosecute cases of fraudulent
credit card use. All connections to, and transactions within Shopco are logged and regularly audited. WE USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE TO
US TO PURSUE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST PERSONS ATTEMPTING FRAUD OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS, IN ALL ICPO/INTERPOL JURISDICTIONS.
