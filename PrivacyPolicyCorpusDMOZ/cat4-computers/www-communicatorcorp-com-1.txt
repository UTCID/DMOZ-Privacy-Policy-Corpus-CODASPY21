Privacy
This section of our website is designed to explain what we do with information about people, also known as “personal data”.
It is divided into two main sections.
Our main privacy notice – this describes what we do with personal data in our own right, as a controller, in the course of running our business.  It covers matters such as how we treat the personal data of the people who work at our customers and suppliers, how we use personal data to market our services to businesses, and how our website uses cookies.  It also describes your rights over your personal data.
Our service privacy notice – this describes what we do with personal data on behalf of our customers as their processor, as part of our service to them.  It covers matters such as how our customers can use our service to send emails and SMS messages to you, and how you can report potentially abusive messages to us so we can address the matter with our customer.
Our customers are responsible for making sure you can exercise your rights in respect of emails or SMS messages which we send to you on their behalf, and you should contact them in the first instance using the information provided in their message to you.  If for any reason you cannot, please let us know, and we will be happy to pass on your request to them instead.
We are The Communicator Corporation Limited.  We are an English company with company number 04657788.  If you have questions about our handling of personal data, you can contact us by email to info@communicatorcorp.com, or by writing to us at Compliance Services, Communicator, 2nd Floor, Eldon Court, Percy Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7JB.
