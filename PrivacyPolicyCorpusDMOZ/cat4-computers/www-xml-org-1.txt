XML.org Focus Areas are operated by the OASIS international standards consortium. Use of these sites are subject to the XML.org Editorial Guidelines and these Terms.
Posting content to XML.org Focus Areas
OASIS does not claim ownership of content
provided by users of XML.org sites. By posting, uploading, inputting,
providing or submitting content, you grant OASIS permission to use that
content in connection with the operation of XML.org, including the
license rights to copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display,
publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your
submission; and to publish your user name in connection with your
submission. By providing content, you warrant and represent that you
own or otherwise control all of the rights to your content including,
without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post,
upload, and input the submission.
OASIS utilizes a third party service for spam control. By submitting
content to an XML.org Focus Area, you accept that your message and other personal
details about you will be analyzed and stored for anti-spam and quality
monitoring purposes, in accordance with the Mollom Web Service Privacy Policy.
OASIS is under no obligation to post or use any
submission you may provide. No compensation will be paid with respect
to the use of your submission. OASIS reserves the right to remove any
content that it deems inaccurate, inappropriate, misleading, not
directly related to an XML.org Focus Area topic, or not in keeping with
the mission of the site. Those who violate XML.org Editorial Guidelines repeatedly may be prohibited from future participation.
Inappropriate usage
As a condition of your use of XML.org, you
agree not use the site for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited
by these Terms. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree
that when using XML.org, you will not:
Upload, or otherwise make available,
files that contain images, photographs, software or other material
protected by intellectual property laws, including, by way of example,
and not as limitation, copyright or trademark laws (or by rights of
privacy or publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or
have received all necessary consents to do the same.
Use
any material or information that is made available through XML.org in a
manner that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret,
or other proprietary right of any party.
Falsify
or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or
proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of material
contained in a file that is uploaded.
Use
XML.org in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair
the XML.org site or interfere with any other party's use of XML.org.
Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any XML.org service, other
accounts, computer systems or networks connected to XML.org, through
hacking, password mining or any other means.
Obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available through XML.org.
Use

otherwise).

(such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.
Publish,

defamatory, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or
information.
Publish,
post, upload, distribute or disseminate any topic, name, material or
information that incites discrimination, hate or violence towards one
person or a group because of their belonging to a race, a religion or a
nation.
Upload files
that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots,
corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may
damage the operation of another's computer or property of another.
Harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses.
Create a false identity for the purpose of misleading others.
Responsibility for content
While members of XML.org Editorial Boards
volunteer their time to monitor postings, OASIS does not control,
endorse, or guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of content
posted to XML.org by users. OASIS specifically disclaims any liability
with regard to the content, including, without limitation, liability
for any errors or omissions, or for any damage incurred as a result of
the use of content. Views expressed by users on XML.org do not
necessarily reflect those of OASIS. Those who post content to XML.org
may or may not have an interest in a company or product they are
discussing. The decision whether to disclose that information is theirs
to make. Users must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the
use of any content.
User account, password, and security
If you elect to become a registered user of an
XML.org Focus Area site, you must provide current, complete, and
accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration form.
You will select your own user name and be assigned a password. You are
entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any
and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify
OASIS immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other
breach of security. OASIS will not be liable for any loss that you may
incur as a result of someone else using your password or account,
either with or without your knowledge.
Links to third party sites
XML.org pages contain links to third party web
sites. These links are provided as a community resource, and the
inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by OASIS of the site
or any association with its operators. If you navigate to a linked site
through XML.org, you are responsible for viewing and abiding by the
privacy statements and terms of use posted at that site.
No resale of service
XML.org is a community resource provided freely
to the public by OASIS and its members. Users of the site are not
authorized to sell, resell or offer for any commercial purposes XML.org
services or access to the XML.org site.
Practices regarding use and storage
While OASIS engages in reasonable efforts to
back up XML.org content and make such data available in the event of
loss or deletion, OASIS has no responsibility or liability for the
deletion or failure to store content maintained on XML.org. OASIS
reserves the right to archive content.
Liability disclaimer
By registering as an XML.org user or sponsoring
an XML.org Focus Area site, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless OASIS, XML.org and its sponsors and their respective officers,
employees and agents, from any and all claims or demands, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising
out of your acts or omissions, including claims arising out of your use
of XML.org; your submissions; or your violation of these Terms.
YOUR USE OF XML.ORG IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
XML.ORG IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, AND OASIS
ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR
FAILURE TO STORE ANY OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION
SETTINGS. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA WHICH RESULTS FROM THE USE OF XML.ORG.

OPERATION OF XML.ORG MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE FROM NUMEROUS
FACTORS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF OASIS. SCHEDULED AND EMERGENCY
MAINTENANCE WORK MAY TEMPORARILY INTERRUPT SERVICES OR ACCESS TO

XML.ORG SITE. YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT OASIS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR
LIABLE FOR ANY THREATENING, DEFAMATORY, OBSCENE, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL
