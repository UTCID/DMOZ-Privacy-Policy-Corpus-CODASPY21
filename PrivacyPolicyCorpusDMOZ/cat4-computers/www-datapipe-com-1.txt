Rackspace Privacy and Data Protection
With Privacy and Data Protection (PDP), Rackspace Technology will help you protect your sensitive business data and assist you with meeting
regulatory data compliance requirements related to data storage and protection.
We’ll also help you assess your threat risk, create custom policies to encrypt and restrict access to sensitive PII data, and report on data access — helping to ensure that your important data remains protected.
When paired with Rackspace® Managed Security, you’ll also receive additional 24x7x365 threat monitoring, response and analytics. We can then compare your data access information with other data feeds to identify behavioral anomalies and potential threats.
Understand Your RiskRestrict Access to DataUse Detailed ReportingUnderstand Your RiskWe’ll work with you to help you understand — and mitigate — your risk:We’ll assess the different types of data you generate and storeWe’ll help you create a data-classification policyWe’ll establish the sensitivity of each type of dataWe’ll make recommendations on how to best protect itRestrict AccessRestrict Access to DataWe use the data classification policy we created in the phase above to encrypt and restrict access to customer data.We deploy and configure a data security platform and agents into your environmentWe create custom access policiesWe institute data transformation protocols around data encryption, key management and routine backupsWe monitor your technology platform for any issuesDetailed ReportingUse Detailed ReportingWe’ll track your data usage and protection measures, and generate detailed reports about access to sensitive data that you can use to help meet compliance objectives.
How It Works
Protect files, data volumes and databases while minimizing impact to usersRackspace PDP provides encryption on top of your existing applications and workflows, resulting in minimal impact to your users. No complicated migrations or deployments required.Use granular access policies to identify unauthorized access & inefficienciesAllow users access to only the data they need. Gain insight into data accessibility, which can be used to help identify unknown workflows and increase business efficiencies.Create & implement a data classification policyBenefit from an additional layer of governance over new or existing corporate and regulatory-based data classification systems to help meet your compliance objectives.Obtain optional 24x7x365 monitoring & responseWhen paired with Rackspace Managed Security, information about data access can be correlated with other data feeds to identify behavioral anomalies and potential threats.Collect evidence to help you meet compliance requirementsUse detailed PDP reports to gather evidence that can be used to confirm and validate your compliance efforts and, when combined with Compliance Assistance, includes fully mapped evidence specialized to your compliance landscape backed by experienced compliance personnel.
