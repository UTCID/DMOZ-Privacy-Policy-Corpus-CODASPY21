Privacy Policy Updated
Submitted by Thoul on Thu, 08/09/2012 - 04:51
There's one important change during the recent server move that I forgot to mention. The phpBB Smith web site Privacy Policy has been updated.
The spirit of the Privacy Policy is the same, but the language has been updated to reflect more current standards and greater amounts of information gathered by new technologies introduced to the site since the original policy was created. The old policy was based on a template generator I used over ten years ago, so there was a definite need to recast this document with a modern touch. If you have any concerns about it, please check out the Privacy Policy.
