BigOven's Privacy and No Spam Policy
Here's our privacy policy in plain, simple
English.  We respect your privacy.  We strongly dislike unsolicited
email.  We think we need to ask your permission before we use any
information you give us for any other purpose than to improve the product, and
improve our service to you.  This means we don't sell or rent your
information to any party.
We provide a simple
opt-out
screen for you to use to shut off all contact from us at any time.
Answers to Common Questions
1. What sort of information is requested from me on
this site?
If you elect to sign up for access
to our recipe archive, we need your email address.  This is so we (or
other users) can contact you in the event that your posted recipes or comments
have problems.
If you purchase the product, or
provide additional optional information to us, we keep it private.  You
can always
opt-in or opt-out
of our newsletter
at any time.
2. What is done with my email address?
The email address that you give us will
be used to send you any newsletters that you signed up for.
3. What is done with the information collected by BigOven?
We refer to it to improve the service and product we deliver to you.  Over time, we will be customizing BigOven
further to make it even more focused on your individual needs, and this
information may be used in that effort.
BigOven makes use of Google Analytics to help advertisers present more relevant messages.
If you wish, you can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising.
BigOven, and third-party vendors including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to your site.
Personally-identifiable information is never shared, leased, sold or provided to third parties.
4.  Other information used to improve our service
In some of our apps, geo-location services are used to optionally enhance the
user experience, as well as the relevance of messages from third parties,
notably advertisements in the free apps, such as savings that might be available
at a local grocery store.  When users opt-into providing location
information on their mobile devices in the free apps, BigOven may
use this information to provide more relevant or targeted information, including
advertisements from third parties.  At no time is the information provided
in a personally-identifiable way.
Statement of Copyright
BigOven's recipe software and unique method of retrieving, posting, rating and
sharing recipes is proprietary.  The recipe archive at BigOven.com is a
mechanism for other users to share, discuss and swap recipes, in conjunction
with our proprietary, copyrighted software.  Users are not permitted to
access our electronically hosted archive through any other means than via our own software, or manually via a web browser (without automation) without the expressed
written consent of AISLE AHEAD Inc.  The starting content resident
on it is a collection of recipes that have been posted or shared in public
newsgroups, forums or bulletin boards by a number of people from around the
world over many years, but it has gone through substantial editing by Lakefront
Software, and that editing and improvement process is ongoing.
Neither the edited and formatted content, nor the method to access it, search
and post recipes and user ratings have been placed in the public domain, and are
copyright AISLE AHEAD Inc.  The recipe archive allows other users
to swap and share recipes more easily; we do not claim copyright ownership of
the recipes themselves.  Except as explicitly noted in each individual
recipe itself, the recipes are deemed purely instructional content and thus in
the public domain.  Many of the recipes have been modified for
categorization, spelling and/or accuracy by BigOven editors, but we do not claim
copyright ownership on the content itself.
Are you the owner of work you believe has been shared here improperly?  We'd
be happy to quickly investigate and respond.  Please visit our
copyright section for more information.
