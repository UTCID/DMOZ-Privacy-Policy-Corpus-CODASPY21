While we have set out the categories below as required by the CCPA, you can review our Privacy Notice for examples and other information that describes our data collection and use, as previously disclosed to you which have not changed under this Notice.This Notice consists of the following sections:We Do Not Sell Your Personal InformationYour CCPA RightsCategories of Personal Information We Collect and SourcesCategories of Third Parties with Whom We Share Personal InformationCategories of Personal Information We Use for a Business or Commercial Purpose1. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide California residents the right to opt-out from such sales. SurveyMonkey does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the CCPA and its implementing regulations.To the extent that you have taken the position that a website’s use of third party cookies or similar technology for advertising or analytics constitutes a “sale” under the CCPA, you may consider SurveyMonkey to have “sold” what the CCPA refers to as “identifiers” (e.g. IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (e.g. information about an individual’s browsing activity on a SurveyMonkey website), and “commercial information” (e.g. the fact that a browser visited a webpage directed at individuals considering purchasing SurveyMonkey products or services). Please refer to our Cookies Policy and Help Center article for more information, including how to exercise your rights to opt-out or manage your cookie preferences.  2.
Your CCPA RightsSubject to certain restrictions, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect about you, to delete any personal information that we collected from or maintain about you, and to opt-out of any sale of personal information about you. As a California resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests, including our means of verifying your identity.

There, we will provide you with your information in a password-protected format.If you wish to exercise any of these rights and do not have an account with us, please contact us here and we will request additional information to verify your identity where possible. Right to non-discrimination for exercising your CCPA rightsThe CCPA prohibits us from discriminating against you for exercising the CCPA rights described in this section. Such discrimination may include charging different prices for our services, providing or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of services, or refusing to provide services to you if you exercise your CCPA rights.
