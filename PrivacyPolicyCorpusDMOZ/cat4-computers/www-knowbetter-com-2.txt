Arizona,

electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to

agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this
agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting our
customer
support site at http://dnndev.zendesk.com. In the unlikely event
that the KnowBetter Customer Support is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if
KnowBetter has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally),
we
each agree to resolve those disputes through the dispute resolution procedure outlined herein.
For the purposes of this Dispute Resolution Agreement, references to "KnowBetter,"
"you,"
and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in
interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us.
Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.
a) Negotiation: If KnowBetter Creative Services LLC determines in its sole discretion that negotiation
could achieve a successful resolution, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any
dispute
or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation between executives who have
authority to settle the controversy. The customer shall give KnowBetter written notice of any dispute not
resolved in the normal course of business. If KnowBetter believes a response is necessary, KnowBetter
shall
respond within 30 days after delivery of the notice.  The notice shall include (a) a statement of that
party’s
position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive
who will represent that party and of any other person who will accompany the executive. If requested by
KnowBetter Creative Services LLC within 30 days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of
both
parties shall communicate (letters or emails) or meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and
thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute. All reasonable
requests for information made by one party to the other will be honored. All negotiations pursuant to this
clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
applicable rules of evidence.
b) Mediation: If KnowBetter Creative Services LLC in its sole discretion believes mediation would be
beneficial and a dispute or claim arises from or relates to this contract or the breach thereof, and if
the
dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions or negotiations, the Parties shall participate in
Mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial
Mediation Procedures before resorting to binding arbitration.
c) Binding Arbitration: The parties further agree that any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of
or relating to this contract, or breach thereof, may be settled by binding arbitration administered by the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules
and
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.
The decision to arbitrate or not shall be the sole and exclusive decision of KnowBetter Creative Services
LLC. If KnowBetter Creative Services LLC demands Arbitration, the customer is required to participate in
Arbitration as the exclusive venue to resolve the dispute. The place of arbitration shall be Maricopa
County, Arizona and the arbitration will be conducted in the English language. The arbitration shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Arizona. The arbitration will be based on the submission of documents
and there shall be no in-person or oral hearing. The AAA Arbitration Optional Rules for Emergency Measures
of Protection are also incorporated by the Parties. The award of the arbitrators shall be accompanied by a
reasoned opinion. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any binding arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of
both parties. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and KnowBetter Creative Services
LLC
are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
