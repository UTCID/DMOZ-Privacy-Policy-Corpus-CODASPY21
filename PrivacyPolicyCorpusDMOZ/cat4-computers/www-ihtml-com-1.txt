Inline respects the privacy of visitors to our site and those that download or provide information to us. Inline does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. The information you provide will not be given to unaffiliated third parties.
Inline may from time to time send you information about new versions of our products but you always have the option to remove yourself from any mailings.
Inline may consolidate information from our various sites about a particular user based on email address so as not to send duplicate messages in mailings.
Inline provides a method (myiHTML) to allow our users to modify information about themselves and know the consolidated information.
Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the support forum or in our mailing list, that information, along with any other information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Inline.
