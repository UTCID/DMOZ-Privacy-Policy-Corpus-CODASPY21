For Parents: Children's Privacy
Our website is not directed at, or intended for use by, children under the age of 13.
This website is a general audience website but we have blocked out users under 13 on the kids chat area of our site that may be misunderstood by some as being directed for users under 13.
We do not knowingly allow anyone to provide any personal identifying information on our website. Everyone must take caution before sending personal information over the Internet and through chatrooms. If you have discovered that your child (who is under 13) has registered for a message forum account, please contact us with your child's message forum username and we will have that account and any message postings he/she has made, removed immediately.
Important Note: The kids chat is for older kids.
Specifically, users aged 13-16 years old. Our moderators will, on occasion, implement an age verification process to prevent users, under the age of 13 or over the age of 16, to participate in the Kids chat.
We sometimes do allow users over 16, but under 19, to participate, but prefer them to utilize our teen chat room instead.
There are several rooms which are strictly for users 18 and over.
They are the Adult Chat and sex chat rooms.
Due to the content of the rooms, they are constantly monitored to ensure users underage will be removed.
However, you, as a user, will be held solely responsible for your actions if you participate in those chat rooms.
Age cannot be easily verifiable.
Public Forums
This website makes chat rooms and message forums available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information to others.
As mentioned earlier email addresses are required in order to register for certain areas of the website and IP addresses are stored in our access logs, but those are never shared with any third parties and are only used for registration purposes.
In addition, users must be 13 years or older in order to register to the forums.
As mentioned previously, if your child is under 13 and has registered for a forums account, please contact us immediately with their username and we will have it removed immediately.
