Billing guideline part B does not apply to you if WatchMeGrow does not charge you directly. B) If you provide WatchMeGrow (or its payment processor) your credit card information, you understand that charges will be billed to your credit card and you authorize such automatic monthly billing to your credit card by WatchMeGrow.

Choice of Law; Arbitration. Any dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.  The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.   Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.  You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.  Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.  You and the Company must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR THE COMPANY MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (iv) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Washington State law or United States federal law. Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Thurston County, WA, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Thurston County, WA for such purpose.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Thurston County, WA. For more information on AAA, its rules and procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.
Release. You hereby release WatchMeGrow and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any interactions with or conduct of the Centers, other users, or third-party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Service.  If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
Miscellaneous. WatchMeGrow shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from WatchMeGrow in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that WatchMeGrow provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing.  The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights. Where WatchMeGrow requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing WatchMeGrow with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to WatchMeGrow is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by Agreement, WatchMeGrow’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give notice to WatchMeGrow at the following address: 2625 Willamette Dr NE, Lacey, WA  98516.  Such notice shall be deemed given when received by WatchMeGrow by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address. Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without WatchMeGrow’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. WatchMeGrow may freely assign Agreement. If any provision of Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of Agreement will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
