A "cookie" is a small text file that a web server stores in browser software.
A browser sends cookies to a server when the browser makes a connection to the server (for example, when requesting a web page from the same domain that created the cookie). The purpose of cookies is to remember the browser over time and distinguish one browser instance (or user) from all others.
Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Data previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and how to remove them.
Cookies can remember login information, preferences, and shopping cart contents.
Other cookies, often placed by our partners or other third parties, are used for analytics, marketing, or advertising.
Cookies, as well as other tracking technologies, such as HTML5 local storage, Local Shared Objects (such as “Flash” cookies), web beacons, and similar mechanisms, may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed.
