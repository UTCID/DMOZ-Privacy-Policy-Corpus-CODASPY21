TrafficSwarm Privacy Policy
TrafficSwarm.com takes your privacy seriously,
and has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to online privacy.
Please read the following to learn more about our information gathering
and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable
information.
IP Addresses
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our web server,
and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address,
should you decide to create a TrafficSwarm account, is also used to
prevent you from registering twice due to temporary technical problems.
Cookies
Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent
to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a
unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however,
in no way does this tell us who you are. TrafficSwarm.com has two primary
uses for its cookies.
First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may
be presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that
you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions
over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested in
a particular offer. We also use cookies to help track referring web
sites.
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors
to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web
browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie
is being sent.
