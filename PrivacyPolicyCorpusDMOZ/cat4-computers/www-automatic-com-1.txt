Data and Privacy
General Information
Why has Automatic Labs discontinued its services?
Like many other companies in the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, and we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the Automatic connected car product, service and platform. All operations were shut down at 11:59 pm, PT, on May 28, 2020, including our automatic crash notification service.
My service has ended, what should I do with my Automatic adapter?
Please discard your adapter by following standard electronic recycling procedures. You do not need to send your adapter back to Automatic.
Rebate Eligibility
Am I eligible for a rebate for the Automatic service that I purchased?
In order to receive a rebate, you must have submitted your request by June 15, 2020.
How will the rebate be delivered?
If you applied for a rebate and were deemed eligible, your virtual Mastercard gift card was sent to the email address associated with your Automatic account before Aug 19 from the email address no-reply-automaticlabs@hawkmarketplace.com.  If you have not received your rebate, please check your spam or junk folders and if further assistance is needed please refer to https://www.myprepaidcenter.com/contact-us.
If you received an Automatic adapter from an Auto Dealership
If you purchased an Automatic adapter from your Auto Dealership, please contact your dealer directly. All participating dealers in the Automatic Dealer Program have been notified of the shutdown of Automatic and the discontinuation of service.
How do I activate my virtual Mastercard gift card?
Your virtual Mastercard gift card must be activated within 90 days months of the date you received it via email. Please follow the instructions in the email to activate your electronic Mastercard gift card. If you need help with activating your card, you may reach out to myprepaidcenter.com/contact-us.
When does my virtual Mastercard gift card expire?
Your virtual Mastercard gift card expires 6 months after issuance (date of email). Please visit www.myprepaidcenter.com/contact-us if you have any questions about your Mastercard gift card expiring.
I lost my virtual Mastercard gift card email
Please visit www.myprepaidcenter.com/contact-us for assistance with your virtual Mastercard gift card email.
