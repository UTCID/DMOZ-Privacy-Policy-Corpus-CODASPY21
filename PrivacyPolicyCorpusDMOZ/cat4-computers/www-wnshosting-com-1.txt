If it is brought to our attention that one of
our customers is violating this policy, we take
steps to stop them and ensure it doesn't happen
again. We also do everything within our power
to keep non-customers from using our email servers
for spam.
All client information such as email, phone numbers,
addreses, etc is used only for internal purposes.
This contact information is used to get in touch

and services.
We take steps to safeguard customer information.
We restrict access to the personal and account
information of our customers to those employees
who need to know that information in the course
of their job responsibilities. We maintain physical,
electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply
