Privacy Policy
- DeskShare
This Privacy Policy discloses the
privacy practices of DeskShare, Inc. If you have questions or concerns
regarding this statement, you should first
contact us. DeskShare recognizes the importance of on-line privacy
and has created this Privacy Policy to describe the types of information
we can (and cannot) collect at DeskShare (also called the "Site")
from visitors to this Site, and how we can use such information. Unless
DeskShare has entered into a written agreement with you that expressly
replaces this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy applies to you while
you are using this Site.
1.
Personally Identifiable Information,
Aggregate Information, and DeskShare Content
Personally identifiable information
(or "personal information") is any information that
can identify you personally or can be linked to you personally
(i.e., name, address, credit card information). DeskShare will
use personal information only in the manner described in this
Privacy Policy and will not share personal information with
any third party unless you give us your prior consent for such
use.
"Aggregate information"
is any information that cannot be linked to you personally (i.e.,
statistics regarding numbers and types of visitors). DeskShare
can freely use and share the aggregate information we collect
from the Site for our business purposes.
Persons who register at the
Site and agree to our Terms of Service can access and use services
offered by DeskShare, Inc. All information that you enter through
the DeskShare site is referred to as "Content" whether
such information is personally identifying or not, and our policy
regarding such content is described in the DeskShare Content
paragraph below.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy
prevents DeskShare from disclosing any of the above-described
information to the extent required by or to comply with an applicable
rule of law, a request of a government agency or any other valid
legal process (referred to collectively as a "Legal Process").
2.
IP Addresses
Your computer generates a unique
identifier (its IP Address) that is communicated to a web site
when you visit or log on to the web site. We use IP addresses
to help diagnose problems with administration of our Site, and
to provide technical support for DeskShare products.
3.
Cookies
A cookie is an element of data
that a web site can send to your browser and that your browser
may then store on your computer system. Your browser will then
return the cookie information to the domain where it originated
(in this case, the Site). You can set your browser to notify
you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept
or not. We use cookies to manage the DeskShare log-in process,
and to save your password if you do not wish to re-enter it
with each visit.
4.

Any visitor to the Site may
register at our Site and create a Site Account. All persons
who wish to create or use DeskShare, or who wish to subscribe
to DeskShare's Newsletter, are required to create a Site Account.
You will provide us with certain information when you register
(including your name, password and e-mail address). We use this
information for purposes related to your DeskShare account including
technical support, update notices, notices of maintenance downtime
schedules and other administrative matters, or other matters
pertinent to your DeskShare products or account. We may also
use this information to let you know about other products and
services that we think may be of interest to you.
5.
Updating/Deleting Your Site Account
You may update the registration
information you provided us at any time by going to Log-in ,
entering into your DeskShare account and clicking "My Account"
You may at any time delete your account; however, by deleting
your account, you will terminate whatever rights you then have
to access your DeskShare account and unless DeskShare has otherwise
expressly agreed with you in writing, termination of your site
account will not result in the refund of any fees paid to DeskShare.
Unless you expressly request that your site account be deleted,
you agree that your registration information may be maintained
by DeskShare indefinitely, under the then-most current Privacy
Policy.
6.
DeskShare Content
Persons who create or are invited
to use DeskShare may place information into DeskShare documents,
files and other data (referred to as the "Content").
Neither DeskShare nor any agent of DeskShare will in any way
access or view any such Content except as required to resolve
a technical support issue or to comply with a legal process.
In every case where DeskShare accesses Content, DeskShare will
either obtain prior approval from the Administrator of the DeskShare
account, or promptly inform the Administrator after such access
has been made. In all cases, DeskShare will treat the Content
as confidential information unless otherwise required for a
legal process.
7.
DeskShare Use
DeskShare may gather information
regarding access to/frequency of use of your DeskShare products.
We will use such information for security purposes and to identify
DeskShare accounts that have been abandoned or to determine
other DeskShare-related services that may be useful to you.
8.
Security
In order to protect the privacy
of the personal information you supply, DeskShare and its network
supplier implement industry standard security features including
use of SSL encryption, firewalls, back-ups, passwords and audits.
You acknowledge, however, that no security system is completely
error free, hacker proof, or failsafe, and as such, DeskShare
does not make any warranties of privacy.
9.

From time to time, we may inform
you about products or services indirectly related to your DeskShare

Policy from time to time by posting updated policies to this
