Introduction
We are committed to respecting your online privacy and we recognize your need for the protection and management of any Personal Information that you share with us. We provide this Privacy Policy to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Site. “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.
Your Consent
By using the Site, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to our processing of Personal Information for the purposes stated herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, then please do not use the Site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and your continued use of the Site thereafter means that you accept those changes.
General Use of the Site
We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site other than in order to post comments on the User Communication Platforms. Maven eCommerce reserves the right to change such matter from time to time, as set forth herein.
What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It
We receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:
Account. In order to provide you with certain services that we may offer through the Site, we may request that you register an account (“Account”). For example, such an Account may be required in order to post a comment onto the User Communication Platforms. As part of the Account registration process, you will be asked to provide us certain mandatory Personal Information such as your username, first name, phone number, email address, company name, a password that you will use in connection with your Account, and other designated information. You may also choose to provide your fax number, date of birth, job title, website, country, a company contact person, and other information. We do not intend to make any of your Account information publicly available on the Site other than if you comment on the User Communication Platform, then we may display a partially obscured version of your user name on the Site as part of the User Communication Platform.
‘Contact Us’ or ‘Update’ request Information. If you send us a “contact us” request or “request to receive updates” we will receive and store a copy of your name, email address, telephone, and country, as well as any other Personal Information that you choose to disclose.
Log Files. The Site may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the Site, and gather demographic information.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Some of our Site pages may utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. If you block or delete “cookies” you may find the usefulness of our Site or parts of it to be impaired.
Use of Personal Information
If you submit Personal Information to us through the Site, Account User Submissions or any other way, then such Personal Information may be used in the following ways:

Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third-party service providers that post a Privacy Policy governing their processing of Personal Information.
