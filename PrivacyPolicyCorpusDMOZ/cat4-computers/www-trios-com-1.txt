Tort Law
This course is about one of the fundamental disciplines in civil law – Torts. Although the concepts of law and justice are very ancient, the concepts of Tort Law evolved recently. Negligence, now the most important of all tort doctrines, emerged only in 1932 in a British case-law about a snail. The law went a long way before distinguishing clearly between tort and crime. Nowadays crime is regarded as a wrong against the society as a whole, while tort is regarded only as a “civil wrong”. Although tort does not deserve such denunciation by the society as crime, those who commit tort are liable for the consequences of their acts and ought to remedy the affected parties. The students will learn about the extra-contractual duty of care and about the standards this duty has to be carried out in order to avoid unreasonable harm to others. Tort law addresses a wide variety of wrongs and a wide range of damages (categories of harm) that flow from that wrongs. Before exploring that range the students will learn about the fundamental elements of a cause in action in tort and at the end of the course will be able to determine the damages and the respective remedies in tort, together with identifying the major categories of tort and the potential defences. Thus the students will be prepared to litigate claims in tort in the Small Claims Court and to assist parties in both capacities – as plaintiffs or defendants.
