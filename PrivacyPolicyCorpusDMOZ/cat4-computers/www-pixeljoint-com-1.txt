Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that PixelJoint.com does not own or control, or to people that PixelJoint.com does not employ or manage.
Collection of your Personal Information
PixelJoint.com collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, telephone number, demographic information, and information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
PixelJoint.com does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, religion, or political affiliations, with personally identifiable information. PixelJoint.com takes precautions to segregate any sensitive data you may provide on PixelJoint.com and services that reference your race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliations.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through PixelJoint.com public online forums or through your own PixelJoint.com public site, this information may be collected and used by others.
