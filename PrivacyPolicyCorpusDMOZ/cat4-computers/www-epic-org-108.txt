Statement of the Electronic Privacy Information Center to
Maryland Attorney General Identity Theft Forum
Baltimore, MD
November 21, 2005 Dear Attorney General Curran, Thank you for convening this forum on identity theft and for soliciting
comment from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).  EPIC is
a public interest research center in Washington, D.C. It was established
in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties issues and
to protect privacy, the First Amendment, and constitutional values.
We believe that individuals need to have more control over their credit
report in order to curb identity theft.  Specifically, individuals should
be able to "freeze" their credit report.  A frozen credit report
is inaccessible to credit grantors.  Credit grantors will not open a new
account without a credit report.  Therefore, by allowing consumers to have
more control and freeze their reports, they can stop identity theft. In the identity theft debate, there has not been enough consideration of
allowing individuals to control their own data to prevent the crime.  Currently,
access to credit reports is controlled by consumer reporting agencies, companies
that make money by selling reports.  Hundreds of thousands of "users"
have access to the consumer reporting system and are able to obtain reports
on anyone with just a few keystrokes.  Under the current system, a huge
network of businesses have total control over our most detailed financial
information. Giving individuals control over credit reports would check market forces
that have flamed the identity theft problem.  In the world of instant credit,
credit grantors are under incredible competitive pressure to issue new accounts.
This pressure makes it easy for even unsophisticated criminals to gain access
to new accounts in others' names.  In fact, lax practices so permeate the
current system that credit cards have been issued to dogs and babies.
Federal legislative efforts to address identity theft have ignored individuals'
lack of control and the mounting evidence that instant credit contributes
to the crime.  Federal law allows individuals to file fraud alerts and identity
theft warrants, but these measures are remedial and are employed after the
crime has occurred.  Congress has criminalized identity theft and heightened
penalties.  None of this has served to prevent the crime. Meanwhile, the financial services industry has begun to "blame the
victim" for identity theft.  They argue that in a large majority of
cases, roommates, family members, and others close to the victim most often
commit the crime.  However, only about half of identity theft victims even
know how their identity was stolen.[1]  Only 26% know the actual identity
of the thief, and in those cases, 35% of the time, the impostor was a family
member.[2]  This crime remains
one where most people do not know how it was committed nor who committed
it.  But the financial services industry wants to blame the victim in order
to maintain the status quo, and to shift the focus from away from their
own practices.  Blaming the victim distracts policymakers from the issue
that needs to be addressed: individual control over credit reports. Consumers need to be able to freeze their credit reports to prevent identity
theft.  Credit freeze is a sensible option that people should be able to
choose to take.  But because of market forces, it is a choice that consumer
reporting agencies will not offer the public.  Consumer reporting agencies
want to decide for us how our personal information will be controlled.
Understanding the Roots of Identity Theft             Instant Credit Makes the Crime Easy to Commit It is important to understand that much of the current scourge of identity
theft is caused by irresponsible, lax credit granting procedures associated
with instant credit.  Grantors have flooded the market with "pre-screened"
credit offers, pre-approved solicitations of credit made to individuals
who meet certain criteria.  These offers are sent in the mail, giving thieves
the opportunity to intercept them and accept credit in the victim's name.[3]  Once credit is granted, the thief changes the
address on the account in order to obtain the physical card and to prevent
the victim from learning of the fraud.[4]  The industry sends out billions
of these pre-screened offers a year.  It 1998, it was reported that 3.4
billion were sent.[5]  In 2003, the number increased
to an estimated 5 billion.[6] Competition also drives grantors to quickly extend credit.  Once a consumer
(or impostor) expresses acceptance of a credit offer, issuers approve the
transaction with great speed.  Experian, one of the "big three"
consumer reporting agencies, performs in this task in a "magic two
seconds."[7]  For instance, in a scenario published in an
Experian white paper on "Customer Data Integration," an individual
receives a line of credit in two seconds after only supplying his name and
address.[8]  Such a quick
response heightens the damage to business and victims alike, because thieves
will generally make many applications for new credit in hopes that a fraction
of them will be granted. Adam Smith, a political columnist with the St. Petersburg Times recently
related in a story about his own experience with identity theft came to
the conclusion that the credit industry and instant credit exacerbates the
crime:
The experience already had taught me that the credit industry makes it
too easy for thieves to plunder other people's credit and too hard for victims
to clear their names. Talking to [Smith's identity thief] Shad Fish, I learned
it's worse than I thought. […]
Think of Mr. Fish the next time a cashier encourages you to open a new
credit account and get an instant discount. Retailers love anything that
entices people to make impulse purchases. My identity thief loved it, too.
"They make it so easy with the instant credit system. It blew my
mind how easy it was when I first started. All you have to do is fill out
a form, hand them an ID and instantly $20,000 becomes available. Then they
want you to spend that $20,000 immediately." [Fish said.][9]
Similarly, Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Jeff Gelles concluded:
The system that makes easy credit possible also fuels identity theft.
And since the Big Three [Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union] have learned
how to profit from fears of identity theft, they have little incentive to
fix the underlying problem.[10]
Identity Verification is Inadequate Another factor in lax issuance is that credit grantors do not have adequate
standards for verifying the true identity of credit applicants.  Credit
issuers sometimes open tradelines to individuals who leave obvious errors
on the application, such as incorrect dates of birth or fudged Social Security
Numbers.  Identity theft expert Beth Givens has argued that many incidences
of identity theft could be prevented by simply requiring grantors to more
carefully review credit applications for obviously incorrect personal information.[11] Standards are so lax that even dogs are issued credit cards.  Chase Manhattan
issued a platinum Visa card to "Clifford J. Dawg" in 2004.[12]
In this instance, the owner of the dog had signed up for a free e-mail account
in his pet's name and later received a pre-approved offer of credit for
"Clifford J. Dawg."  The owner found this humorous and responded
to the pre-approved offer, listing nine zeros for the dog's Social Security
number, the "Pupperoni Factory" as employer, and "Pugsy Malone"
as the mother's maiden name.  The owner also wrote on the approval: "You
are sending an application to a dog! Ha ha ha." The card arrived three
weeks later.[13]  Credit
has been offered and issued to other dogs, including Monty, a Shih-Tzu who
was extended a $24,600 credit line.[14]
The slip ups also occur with humans.  Credit has been granted to children
and babies and young teenagers.[15]  These events suggest that the credit issuers
are lax in their marketing and authentication efforts.  It suggests that
the applications are processed by a computer, and no human reviews them
to prevent fraudulent or improper credit granting. TRW Inc. v. Andrews illustrates the problems with poor standards
for customer identification.[16]  In that case, Adelaide Andrews
visited a doctor's office in Santa Monica, California, and completed a new
patient's information form that requested her name, birth date, and Social
Security Number.[17]  The
doctor's receptionist, an unrelated woman named Andrea Andrews, copied the
information and used Adelaide's Social Security Number and her own name
to apply for credit in Las Vegas, Nevada.  On four occasions, Trans Union
released Adelaide's credit report because the Social Security Number, last
name, and first initial matched.  Once Trans Union released the credit reports,
it made it possible for creditors to issue new tradelines.  Three of the
four creditors that obtained a credit report issued tradelines to the impostor
based on Adelaide's file, despite the fact that the first name, birth date,
and address did not match.[18] There are many other cases where creditors issued new accounts to individuals
who presented applications with obvious errors.  For instance, in Nelski
v. Pelland, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 663 (6th Cir. 2004), a phone company
issued credit to an impostor who used the victim's name but a slightly different
Social Security Number.  In United States v. Peyton, 353 F.3d 1080
(9th Cir. 2003), impostors obtained six American Express cards using the
correct name and Social Security Numbers of victims but directed all six
cards to be sent to the impostors' home.  In Aylward v. Fleet Bank,
122 F.3d 616 (8th Cir. 1997), the bank issued two credit cards based on
a matching name and Social Security Number but an incorrect address.  In
Vazquez-Garcia v. Trans Union De P.R., Inc., 222 F. Supp. 2d 150
(D.P.R. 2002), an impostor successfully obtained credit with matching Social
Security Number but incorrect date of birth and address.  The address used
by the impostor wasn't even in Puerto Rico.  In Dimezza v. First USA
Bank, Inc., 103 F. Supp. 2d 1296 (D.N.M. 2000), an impostor obtained
credit with a Social Security Number match but incorrect address. Consumers Need Control Over Credit Reports to Prevent Identity
Theft At the federal level, legislative and regulatory efforts to address the
identity theft have centered on remedial measures, including the creation
of "identity theft affidavits," which assist victims in reporting
the crime to creditors and consumer reporting agencies.[19]
Victims can also file "fraud alerts" to help deter creditors from
giving an impostor a new line of credit.  But these alerts are not filed
until fraud is actually suspected, and a recent report found that creditors
ignore fraud alerts in some identity theft cases.[20]
These remedial measures do little to prevent identity theft.  In fact, even
formally criminalizing identity theft has not been effective in curbing
its incidence.[21] Because it is too easy for impostors to open new accounts in victim's names,
and because existing protections are ineffective in preventing identity
theft, we need to empower consumers to limit credit report availability.
If individuals can prevent the release of their credit report, they can
stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in their name.
Enabling consumers to freeze their credit would address the sloppy procedures
driven by instant credit.  A frozen system also solves a long-standing problem
with authorized access to credit reports, the "impermissible pull."
This occurs where someone with access to the consumer reporting system obtains
a report on a consumer without a credit application or existing relationship
with the consumer.
For credit freeze to work, it has to be easy for consumers to use.  All
individuals should be able to trigger a freeze (not just identity theft
victims).  There should also be a method for the individual to quickly thaw
their report, so that individuals can take advantage of credit and employment
opportunities.
Credit freeze can also be supplemented by additional protections against
irresponsible credit granting.  For instance, credit grantors should have
to screen customers more carefully.  In California, which has the highest
standard, an instant credit grantor only has to match three identifiers
from the application to the credit "header" on file at the consumer
reporting agency.[22]  However, this protection only applies when
an individual applies for credit at a retailer.[23] Thus, Internet, telephone, and
mail credit granting is not covered.  Furthermore, the categories of information
to be matched could probably be found in public records, the white pages,
or other readily-available tools.  The categories to be matched include
"first and last name, month and date of birth, driver's license number,
place of employment, current residence address, previous residence address,
or social security number."[24]
The California requirement is imperfect, but if strengthened to require
4 or 5 identifiers to match, identity theft would be more difficult to commit. Finally, credit grantors should be liable for damages when negligent in
issuing a new account to an impostor.  Companies that issue credit cards
to dogs, toddlers, and to identity thieves who can't even get the victim's
address right share blame for the crime. Conclusion Identity theft is out of control because individuals have no control over
their personal information.  Instead, a vast network of businesses that
make money from selling information are in control.  Shifting control to
the consumer by allowing the option of credit freeze will check the market
forces that contribute to identity theft.  Those who do not wish to freeze
their credit are welcome to leave it in its current, vulnerable state. A properly designed freeze with a quick-thaw procedure will allow even
those who freeze their credit can take advantage of in-store specials and
instant credit opportunities. Respectfully submitted, Chris Jay Hoofnagle
