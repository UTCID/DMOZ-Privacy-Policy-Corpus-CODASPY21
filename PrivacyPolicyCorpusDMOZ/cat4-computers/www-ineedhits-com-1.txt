g. Code Uploadineedhits will normally only upload "Alt Tag" and "Text Link Tag" optimized code elements in cases where a web page is written in simple HTML. If a web page has been designed using dynamic server side languages (i.e. PHP, ASP, CGI) rather than simple HTML, uploading of non Meta Data elements will be the responsibility of the customer and/or their webmaster.Customers who order Code Upload or other services which provide ineedhits access to make changes to their website, do so with the understanding that ineedhits is not liable for any errors which may occur in these updates. Although full care is taken when making such website changes, customers are expected to backup their website prior to providing ineedhits this access at each instance.

Premium SubmitAll Premium Submit services include manual submission to 17 search engines, manual submission to four directories, the registration of a Google Local listing and automated submission to 100 further search engines. Please note that because of the nature of Google Local listings, we can only create one listing per top level domain.

Adult, Illegal, Pharmaceutical, Violent or Hate related content.l. RankLocal Billing and Ranking Terms
RankLocal keyword selections will be based off the suburb and ranking keyword selected during the ordering process. ineedhits will use the combination of these two phrases to form the key phrase selected for top 10 Google rankings.
A business profile page will be created for each key phrase purchased. These profiles will be optimized for the specified key phrase to assist this listing in achieving top 10 Google rankings. All profiles will be hosted on a separate domain which is controlled by ineedhits.
Following the creation of each business profile, monthly payments will be paused until individual business profiles begin ranking in the top 10 organic search results for the key phrase agreed upon at the time of order. This ranking may be achieved in Google.com or any local variant (eg: Google.com.au). When a top 10 ranking is achieved, customers will be provided with a report and screenshot of their ranking as evidence. Monthly billing will then commence from this date, provided it is at least 30 days after the initial order date.
In the event that ineedhits is unable to achieve top 10 rankings for your chosen key phrase after 6 months, your RankLocal subscription will be cancelled and no further payment will be required. To claim your refund, please contact us within 2 months of this date via moneyback[at]ineedhits.com to claim a refund on your inital months service fee.
