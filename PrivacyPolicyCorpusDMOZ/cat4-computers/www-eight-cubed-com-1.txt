Eight Cubed's Privacy Policy
The following is the formal privacy policy for eight-cubed.com. It's not very formal, but when I say "ever", that's what I mean. The only exception to "ever" is if I am in receipt of a court signed subpoena requesting specific information. Then all bets are off.
The host that serves the content for eight-cubed.com records information about who you are and where you are coming from as a function of the web server that it runs. Information collected includes your IP address, what type of user agent you are using (that is, which browser), the time and date you loaded a page, and the referrer information you send, showing which page you clicked through to get to eight-cubed.com (if any). Collectively, this is called "web log information".
The personally identifiable piece of information in the web log information is the IP address. The IP address addresses in web logs will not be revealed to any third parties. Ever.
The rest of the web log information may be used for research by eight-cubed.com, but it will not be distributed to any third parties. Ever.
Recently, "Do Not Track" signals have been incorporated in browser software. eight-cubed.com does not respond in any special way to these signals, as we don't attempt to track you anyway.
If you choose to comment on a post, you will be asked for your name, e-mail address, and web site URI. The text that you enter in the name field will be displayed in association with your comment, and if you enter a web site URI, the text from the name field will link to that URI. However, your e-mail address will not be shown on the site. Additionally, your e-mail address will not be sold or distributed to any third parties. Ever.
Comment authors have the option of asking the eight-cubed.com to remember their details by selecting the appropriate radio button on the comments entry form. If this is selected, persistent cookies will be stored on your hard drive containing the information you supply.
eight-cubed.com links to external sites (frequently). These sites have their own privacy policies and practices and you should make yourself aware of them. eight-cubed.com is not responsible for the policies or practices of these sites.
eight-cubed.com is concerned enough about your privacy to write this policy and exercise some security skills to protect it (that is, put on a black hat and attempt to do evil things to get unauthorized information from the web site). Should you have any questions or concerns or require clarification of any of these policies, please don't hesitate to contact me.
