SPEC and research partners may use aggregated
and anonymized data for additional site traffic analysis.
April 2009
Order-related contact information (email and/or
mailing address) may be used to contact customers
regarding available updates to their licensed
products
Policy may be amended from time to time with notice
posted on the SPEC website
Removed paragraph regarding use of information provided
when signing up for notices of new products and services,
as sign-up is not currently available. Any such data collected
prior to this update remains covered by previous policy
statements.
Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important, to you, to us, to anyone you may
come in contact with. To better inform you so that you can protect
your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information
practices and the choices you can make about the way your information
is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
available from our homepage and at every point where personally
identifiable information may be requested
The Information We Collect
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
SPEC web site.
We do not commonly use cookies, or other session tracking methods,
on this web site. However, some of our downloads ask a short survey
and we do use a cookie to record whether or not the user has already
completed this survey. This cookie can be refused or deleted with no
ill effect other than being asked to re-fill the survey upon the next
download.
Our comment and survey forms request your name and an email address
that can be used to contact you.
Some pages on this site provide online
forms where you can order products, make requests, and register to receive
materials. Our product order forms require your name, company information,
billing and shipping addresses, as well as email and telephone contact
information.
The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an
order to complete that order. We do not share this information with
outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We also use the supplied contact information to notify you about new
releases and changes to benchmarks for which you are licensed.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.
Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not
shared with outside parties.
We use our system logs, non-identifying information, and aggregate
information monitoring for maintaining and improving our web site and
our services. For example, we do review internally which areas of our
web site get visits, and at what time, and from what Internet domains.
Little of this information is specific to individual behavior, we make
no attempt to identify any individual's behavior, and no individual
information is ever shared with any 3rd parties. We and our research
partners may also perform further analysis of site access patterns or
traffic using aggregated and anonymized information from the system logs.
Finally, were we ever to use or share any personally identifiable
information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described
above, we would first provide you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.
Furthermore, we do not store any individualized or sensitive data on
any of our Internet servers. We do not even store any individualized
financial information on any server within our domain.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
No part of our web site is structured to attract anyone
under 13 and we do not collect any information that might reveal
a visitor's age.
How You Can Access, Correct, or Remove Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information
that we collect online and maintain by contacting us directly;
see our contact information. For
your safety, we do not keep any of this personally identifiable
information online.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
information or request removal of that information by sending us a
request that credibly shows the error and/or your authority over
the material in question.
To protect your privacy and security,
we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
granting access or making corrections.
Changes To This Privacy Policy
We may amend this privacy policy from time to time as we add
new products and services, as we improve our current offerings,
and as technologies change. If we make any material or substantive
changes in our treatment of information collected at this site, we
will notify you by posting a clear and conspicuous notice of these
changes on our website and in this privacy policy.
How To Contact Us
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies,
please contact us or send us an email
