This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.
Security of your Personal Information
The security of your personal information is important to us.  We use encryption and SSL in all areas where personal and account information is required.  To view our certificate information, click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key at the bottom of your browser window or the left side of the address/search bar in your browser.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you can contact us at admin@intechnic.com.
Links to Other Websites
Our Websites provide links to other Websites, which we do not control, and are not responsible for the content or practices of these other Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other Websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have.

Navigational Information
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Intechnic uses cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do use cookies on this site and may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site but will expire when you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, but you can remove them by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords and/or preferences, so you don't have to enter it more than once.  These cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance your experience on our site.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.
Some of our business partners and clients use cookies on our site.  Intechnic Corporation has no access or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by our network of sites and does not cover the use of cookies by any client or business partner.
Log Files
As is true of most Websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information when purchasing through the site, for security purposes only.
Do Not Track
We do not support Do Not Track ("DNT"). DNT is a preference you can enable or disable in your web browser to inform Websites that you do not want to be tracked.
CAN SPAM Policy
We do not send unsolicited commercial email in violation of applicable laws, and include an "opt-out" mechanism and other required information in every commercial email.
Unsubscribe or Opt Out
You may opt out of future communications by following the instructions in an e-mail communication, or by contacting your account representative or project manager.
If you no longer wish to receive our marketing communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at admin@intechnic.com.
