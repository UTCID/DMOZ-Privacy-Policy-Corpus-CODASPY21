Privacy
Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to Supercounters Dot Com. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. If for any reason you have concerns about our service or website's privacy policies, please contact us. We are committed to ensuring that every user's needs are addressed.
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY COUNTER
Our counter service is a simple image. When an image loads from our server, the visitor's web browser automatically provides us with certain information including the visitor's IP address, the URL of the referring page (where the image was placed), and the user-agent string of the visitor (which ordinarily contains the type and version of a visitor's web browser and operating system). However, the information we log is limited.
When a Counter is loaded, our service queries a third-party company's database which is locally hosted on our servers (no information is transmitted to the third-party company. Our service does not use GPS nor do we request or have access to a visitor's precise location). This allows us to determine the country and/or region most likely associated with a particular visitor's IP address, at which time that country and/or region is added as a visit to the counter.
To prevent a returning visitor from repeatedly adding to a counter's statistics, a combination of the visitor's IP address and the particular counter's username are converted to an encrypted hash (which we cannot reverse), and then the hash itself is placed into a filter (for up to 1 hour after which it is erased). This method allows our counters to operate without the use of cookies.
IP addresses of a counter's visitors are not logged or otherwise associated with a particular visit.
We do not build profiles on a counter's visitors nor do we attempt to track or associate visitors from one counter to another. The Counter does not use cookies. Adding the counter to your website will not cause any cookies or advertising on your website itself.
