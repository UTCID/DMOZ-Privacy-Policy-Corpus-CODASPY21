Déclarée grande cause nationale du quinquennat par le président de la République Française, l’égalité professionnelle entre les femmes et les hommes passe par une mobilisation de tous. La Loi pour la Liberté de choisir son avenir professionnel soumet les entreprises à une obligation de résultat. Elle a créé l’Index de l’égalité salariale FemmesHommes. Il est calculé chaque année à partir de 4 ou 5 indicateurs selon la taille de l’entreprise : rémunérations, augmentations, promotions, congés maternité, parité du top management. Il doit être rendu public et transmis à l’inspection du travail.L’index 2019 pour la PerkinElmer SAS en France est de 62 points sur 100. Les indicateurs indiquent pour 2019 des niveaux de rémunération plus favorables envers les femmes et, à contrario, plus favorables envers les hommes en matière d’augmentation de salaire. La parité est atteinte en ce qui concerne la parité du top management. PerkinElmer SAS continue à mettre en place en 2020 des actions visant à réduire les écarts de rémunération entre les hommes et les femmes et à garantir l’égalité entre les Femmes et les Hommes en matière de travail.
