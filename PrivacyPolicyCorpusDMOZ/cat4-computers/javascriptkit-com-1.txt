newsletter will only be used for it's intended purpose of delivering the
newsletter to the subscriber. Under no circumstances
will JavaScript Kit ever resell, redistribute, or allow third party

From time to time,
JavaScript Kit will run contests/ sweepstakes. The winner(s) may be asked

will only be used to deliver the prizes to the winner(s), and will NOT be
