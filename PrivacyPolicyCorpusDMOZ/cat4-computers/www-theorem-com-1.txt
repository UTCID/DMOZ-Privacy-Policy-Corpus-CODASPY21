We have implemented this Privacy and Cookie Policy in line with the latest GDPR and European data protection requirements with respect to information that we collect from you over the web and while providing software or services to you. We want to inform you of our policy and to ensure you that we are taking all necessary steps to safeguard the information you provide. Theorem only collects information to provide you with information on our products and services.
You are free to provide only such information as you determine necessary. In certain cases, we will require that you provide specific data (e.g. for on-line services you must provide an e-mail address). In order to improve the content of our web site, we track the pages you have visited. Theorem does recognize your domain name but does not automatically collect personal information about you. Theorem also collects aggregate information on what web pages are visited. However, no personal information is collected unless volunteered through mechanisms such as surveys or registrations.
Use
The site collects data through a feedback form that allows you to request information about Theorem and its products and services. For this purpose, we request and collect contact information. The form also allows you to provide such other information, as you may desire. Information so collected under a legitimate interest basis is used solely for the purpose of responding to the request made and will be retained for as long as theorem solutions is providing a service. Use of the site may require registration in some areas where it is necessary to track user information. Registration may be required for proprietary information, marketing analysis, and/or lead generation. All personally identifiable information that is collected in the registration process will be housed on a database or databases in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and subject to the applicable laws of that country. Use of the registrant's information will be used solely for the purposes of supplying marketing related material you have opted-in for. You will have the option to change permissions and opt-out of any and/or all communication.
Security
Theorem Solutions takes the accuracy and safety of your information very seriously and would like to assure you that we have put in place multiple levels of security and redundancy in order to continue providing a secure and effective service. All our data is held on restricted internal access platforms that are constantly monitored and maintained to provide both up-to-date security patch levels as well as high availability.  customer data is protected from external penetration by the employment of industry standard, next-gen firewall systems, application-level anti-virus and zero-day anti-ransomware solutions.  external data communication between endpoints is protected with sha2 cryptographic hash algorithms, provided by Symantec.
Cookies
We use cookies and analyse these to enhance your user experience of the website. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your preferences, this information is analysed and allows us to enhance your user experience.
Links to other sites
On certain of our web pages are links to other sites we make every effort to provide you with links to high quality, reputable sites, however, they are not under our day-to-day control. When you click through to these sites you leave the area controlled by the Theorem. We cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising from linking to these sites. You should also note that should you choose to provide those sites with information it will not be covered by Theorem's Privacy and Cookie Policy.
