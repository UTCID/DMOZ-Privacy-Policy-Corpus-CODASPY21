PersonalStockMonitor (PSM) went out of business at the end of 2012. Their
website has been shutdown but StockMarketEye has acquired the rights to their
domain.
StockMarketEye is a modern and maintained portfolio tracker for the
individual investor.
There are versions of StockMarketEye for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as an
iOS version and soon an Android version.

I've never used a program to monitor the market before but this product is great. It
is a simple, yet powerful tool. I can see everything I want to quickly and
easily. The charts are extremely easy to read and setup. I have already
noticed a boost in my investor confidence level in just a week of using
it.
This is not only one of the cleanest-looking but also one of the easiest stock
trackers we've used.
... It is a very easy program to use with a lot of powerful features. I can
spend my time investing, not learning software. Love it ...
This is one of the finest little apps for following the stocks that I have
come across...It is easy for my wife to use and follow her portfolio and
I can use it for additional analysis when talking to my stockbroker.
