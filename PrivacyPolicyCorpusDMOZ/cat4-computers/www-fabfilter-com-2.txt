What personal data do we gather, for which purposes and on which grounds?
The personal data we gather from you as our customer helps us personalize and continually
improve your shopping experience at our website. We use your personal data to deliver services
such as software updates and bug fixes, communicate with you about our promotional offers,
update our records and maintain your account(s) with us, display content such as purchased
license keys and recommend services that might be of interest to you. We use your personal
data for the following purposes (i) to be able to service the agreement we have with you,
(ii) to improve our website, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and (iii)
enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions. In this
Privacy Policy we will lay down the specific processing of your personal data for the
specific purposes we have defined as well as how you can control the personal data we store
about you. Here are the types of information we gather:
Your FabFilter account
After you have made a purchase via the web shop or entered an activation code at our
website, FabFilter will automatically create a personal account for
you. This personal account contains the following information: first name, last name,
address, zip, phone, e-mail address, (un)subscription for newsletters, a purchase
overview and tell-a-friend credit, hereinafter referred to as "Account Information".
If you have made a purchase in the web shop, you have entered into an agreement with
Cleverbridge AG, a company that is licensed to sell our product to you. They collect
information from you to handle your orders, deliver services to you, process payments,
communicate with you about orders, respond to your requests, customise your future
shopping for you, improve the store, and communicate with you. The information they
collect consists of the information that you enter into their website. For further
explanation and information please read the
Cleverbridge
Privacy Policy. In this policy you will find that they will share certain personal
data about you with us. This personal data is made part of your Account Information. You
can control your Account Information at any time.
We only use the Account Information that you provide or we have received through Cleverbridge
AG for the following purposes: (i) delivering our services you wish to receive, (ii) responding
to your requests, (iii) improving our website, and (iv) communicating with you (v) verifying
your identity as part of our proceedings to protect your personal data.
We process Account Information on the grounds of necessity for the performance of the
contract we have with you, or you wish to enter into with us.
For the avoidance of doubt, if you have requested to receive our newsletter, but have never
purchased a product with us, we do not create an account for you, and this paragraph is not
applicable to you.
Your interaction on our website
We receive and store information and personal data from you when you interact with us through our
website. The information and personal data concerned are: your IP (Internet protocol) address,
your computer and browser type and version, your login attempts, your search queries, and other
browsing activities on our website relevant to monitor the function(s) of our website, hereinafter
referred to as "Automatic Information". We use the Automatic Information for the purpose of (i)
delivering our services you wish to receive and (ii) improving our website. We collect your IP
address, to track technical issues and errors so we
are able to improve our website. We use your IP address and log activities to be able to avoid
or eliminate fraudulent use of your account. This way we can – for example – see if there is an
irregular amount of login attempts on your account. This may indicate fraud. In such an
instance we may request you to verify your identity using your Account Information. We store
your IP address and your activities on our website for this purpose in our logs for a maximum
of seven days. You may always contact us if you wish to delete this information and/or personal
data from our files.
We process Automatic Information on the grounds of necessity for the performance of the contract
we have with you, or you wish to enter into with us as well as the grounds of the necessity of
legitimate interests pursued by us and you, being the avoidance of fraud.
E-mail communications
If you have an account with us, or if you have subscribed to receive our newsletter, we will
use your e-mail address to send you e-mails concerning our promotional offers, unless you
choose not to receive such e-mails anymore by unsubscribing yourself for this service in your
account or by clicking at the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of a promotional e-mail message.
You will not receive these promotional e-mails anymore after you have unsubscribed.
When you have subscribed to our newsletter via our website, we may process your email address
on the grounds of the necessity of performing your request to receive our newsletter and on
the grounds of your consent. When you have purchased a product from us, we use your e-mail
address on the grounds of the necessity of our legitimate interests to inform you on our new
products, promotions and updates. As we give you the opportunity to unsubscribe whenever you
would want to, we feel we have taken your interests into account.
The web shop for our merchandise is serviced by sprd.net AG. They collect personal data from you to
handle your orders, deliver services to you, process payments, and communicate with you about orders
respond to your requests. For further explanation and information please read the
sprd.net AG Privacy Policy.
Sprd.net AG does not share any personal data about you with us.
How secure is information about me?
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that all
processing of your personal data will meet the requirements by law and ensure the protection of your
rights. However such protection can unfortunately not be guaranteed, as no system available is one
hundred percent safe. We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission by
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information and the personal data you
input. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection,
storage and disclosure of personal data. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally
request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is important for you
to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off
when you finish using a shared computer, and to not use the "Keep me logged in on this device" login
feature in this case.
Our computers are safeguarded by long and complex passwords. Our servers are physically situated in
the Netherlands and serviced by a Dutch company. Our physical office can only be entered by authorized
personnel. Visitors can only enter the building that our office is situated in, after being given
access by authorized personnel. We have created access profiles for our employees giving them limited
access to our systems and (personal) data actually needed to perform their work.
Your privacy is of continuous importance to us, meaning we will evaluate our privacy policy frequently
and are open to improvement and discussions.
What information can I access and control?
You can chose not to provide us certain personal data, such as your zip code. Not providing us with
certain data may render us unable to fully assist you. We might – for example – need more personal
data to verify your identity when you have lost your password.
We give you access to the personal data that we keep about you and a broad range of information
about your account and your interactions with us for the purpose of viewing and updating or changing
that information. This concerns the following personal data: your address, e-mail address,
subscription to newsletter, an overview of historical purchases (via which you can view your
purchased license keys), and the amount of credit you received by using the tell-a-friend feature.
You can add or update certain information on your FabFilter account. You may alter your
subscription to the newsletter yourselves as well as the possibility to view your historical
purchases and associated license keys. If you don't want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,
please adjust this preference in your FabFilter account or use the unsubscribe link that is placed
at the bottom of every (promotional) e-mail of FabFilter you will receive.
Certain updates and changes to Account Information are – for your safety - carefully controlled by
us and may for that reason not always be made by yourselves. We will be available to assist you with
such changes. Changes to your personal data shall be made in cooperation with us, to make sure such
changes are correct and are not requested by anyone else but yourselves.
You cannot delete your personal FabFilter account yourself. However, if you request us to do so, we
will delete your account for you.
If you wish to receive an even more detailed list of the personal data we use and store about you, please
contact us and we will inform you accordingly. If such an overview would not be sufficient to you,
please let us know, and we will inform you even more specifically where needed.
Do we share the information we receive?
Information about our customers and their personal data is an important part of our business and we
are not in the business of selling it to others. We share your personal data only as
described below and with the subsidiaries that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or
follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.
Third-party service providers
We work together with Cleverbridge AG to handle sales through the/our web shop. They
only have access to personal information they collected from you themselves. They process
the personal information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy and as permitted by
applicable data protection laws.
We use two software systems to communicate through e-mail. All e-mails automatically
generated by our website (such as the e-mails you receive when you create an account or our
newsletters) are sent through a service called SendGrid, part of Twilio, Inc., located in
the USA. Twilio, Inc. participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework.
The second software system we use concerns our support e-mail communication. The program
facilitating this service is called FogBugz, owned and controlled by FogBugz, LLC, located
in the USA. FogBugz LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by
the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
information transferred from the European Union to the United States. FogBugz LLC has
certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Protection of FabFilter and others
We release Account Information and other personal data when we believe release is necessary
to comply with the law; enforce or apply agreed terms or agreements; or protect the rights,
property or safety of FabFilter, our users or others. This may include exchanging information
with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing
personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that
is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Policy.
With your consent
Other than as set out above, you will receive a specified notice before your personal
data may be shared with third parties giving you the opportunity to inform us that you
wish us not to share this personal data, after which we will abstain from doing so. If you
choose to consent to the transfer of data, you may at any time retract your consent and
we will cease sharing your personal data immediately.
Transfer outside the European Economic Area
Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic
Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the
information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by
the applicable laws on data protection.
Are children allowed to use the FabFilter website?
FabFilter doesn't sell services for purchase by children. If you're under 18, you may use the
FabFilter website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

Our policy concerning personal data breaches
When a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, or is
otherwise required by law, or when we feel this is appropriate, we will communicate such a personal
data breach to you without undue delay. Such a notification shall describe in clear and plain
language the nature of the personal data breach contains and shall at least give you the following
information and measures: (a) the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other
contact point where more information can be obtained; (b) describe the likely consequences of the
personal data breach; (c) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to
address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible
adverse effects.

breach and share any information with this authority as required by law.

you and your account. Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Policy will change also.

behind the promises we make and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them
less protective of personal data collected in the past without the prior consent of the customers
affected.
