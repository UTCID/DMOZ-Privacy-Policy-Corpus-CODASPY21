AbyssMedia.com Privacy Policy
AbyssMedia.com will never sell or give our customer or client
information to third parties. For customers, this means that the only
people who have access to your address information is our 3rd party credit
card processor.
What information do we collect? How do we use it?
When ordering from any of our sites or partner sites we collect the
purchaser's name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit
card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill
orders and provide notification of the order status.
How do 3rd party credit card processors protect customer
information?
Customers who buy through AbyssMedia.com are shopping on a secure
server hosted by MyCommerce/Avangate and other 3rd party credit card processors
that encrypts all of the customer's personal information including name,
address and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access
or use personal information in an unauthorized manner.
MyCommerce.com/Avangate.com commerce system was developed in-house with security
as its number one priority. This single entry point allows AbyssMedia.com to maintain
the tightest access control - eliminating (rather than closing) the backdoor.
What about cookies?
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your
browser on your computer's hard drive. MyCommerce/Avangate's cookies
are used only to identify the customer, not to identify any specific
customer traits. These cookies do not store sensitive data. This enables a
more pleasant shopping experience with AbyssMedia.com every time you shop
with us.
AbyssMedia.com welcomes your questions and comments about privacy.
