Legitimate Interests
Under the General Data Protection Regulation certain categories of personal data processed by Fiorano falls under ‘legitimate interests’.

Necessity test: Fiorano may, in cases where assessments have demonstrated that direct marketing is the most effective manner, follow email and other forms of marketing to promote its business. In such cases this processing will be solely restricted to the processing of Business-to-Business (B2B) contacts. Fiorano will not use direct marketing with non-B2B contacts.
Balancing test: Fiorano will only use direct marketing for occasional business-to-business marketing, to business personnel with decision making / influencing / budgetary responsibilities in a business context who we believe in their roles will reasonably expect to be contacted with marketing material relating to his / her professional role.
In all cases, while we do not anticipate any of our direct marketing to be objectionable, recipients will always have the option to unsubscribe from updates in which case once such communication has been received, Fiorano will move related records to a restricted Do Not Contact database. In no manner and at any point will Fiorano engage in direct marketing activities that does not comply with the Purpose, Necessity and Balancing purposes outlined above, or will Fiorano engage in processing activities that we believe may override the rights of Data Subjects.
