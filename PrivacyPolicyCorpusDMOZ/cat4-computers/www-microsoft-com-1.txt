Falcon: Honest-Majority Maliciously Secure Framework for Private Deep Learning
June 2021
by Sameer Wagh; et. al.
We propose Falcon, an end-to-end 3-party protocol for efficient private training and inference of large machine learning models. Falcon presents four main advantages – (i) It is highly expressive with support for high capacity networks such as VGG16 (ii) it supports batch normalization which is important for training complex networks such as AlexNet (iii) Falcon guarantees security with abort against malicious adversaries, assuming an honest majority (iv) Lastly, Falcon presents new theoretical insights for protocol…

A Security Model and Fully Verified Implementation for the IETF QUIC Record Layer
May 2021
by Antoine Delignat-Lavaud; et. al.
We investigate the security of the QUIC record layer, as standardized by the IETF in draft version 30. This version features major differences compared to Google’s original protocol and prior IETF drafts. We model packet and header encryption, which uses a custom construction for privacy. To capture its goals, we propose a security definition for authenticated encryption with semi-implicit nonces. We show that QUIC uses an instance of a generic construction parameterized by a standard…

Hardware-Software Contracts for Secure Speculation
May 2021
by Marco Guarnieri; et. al.
Since the discovery of Spectre, a large number of hardware mechanisms for secure speculation has been proposed. Intuitively, more defensive mechanisms are less efficient but can securely execute a larger class of programs, while more permissive mechanisms may offer more performance but require more defensive programming. Unfortunately, there are no hardware-software contracts that would turn this intuition into a basis for principled co-design. In this paper, we put forward a framework for specifying such contracts,…

Developing Secure Systems Summit – Online Seminar Series: Fall 2020
Upcoming: November 18, 2020
The Developing Secure Systems Summit (DS3) is meant to be an inclusive event, building on several existing communities to forge its identity. On the one hand, we aim to reach out to the security research community that congregates at flagship events like IEEE Security and Privacy, the USENIX Security Symposium, and the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security. Equally, we seek to connect with the open source and industrial software security community that gathers…

Analyzing Information Leakage of Updates to Natural Language Models
November 2020
by Santiago Zanella-Béguelin; et. al.
To continuously improve quality and reflect changes in data, machine learning applications have to regularly retrain and update their core models. We show that a differential analysis of language model snapshots before and after an update can reveal a surprising amount of detailed information about changes in the training data. We propose two new metrics—differential score and differential rank—for analyzing the leakage due to updates of natural language models. We perform leakage analysis using these…

An Empirical Study on the Intrinsic Privacy of SGD
November 2020
by Stephanie Hyland, Shruti Tople
We take the first step towards understanding whether the intrinsic randomness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be leveraged for privacy, for any given dataset and model. In doing so, we hope to mitigate the trade-off between privacy and performance for models trained with differential-privacy (DP) guarantees. Our main contribution is a large-scale empirical analysis of SGD on convex and non-convex objectives, on four datasets. We evaluate the inherent variability in SGD and calculate the…
Career Opportunity
Security Researcher II
October 8, 2020
Come and be part of the team building one of Microsoft’s most exciting security products, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (MDATP). As cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated, MDATP helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks and data breaches on their networks. From detecting nation state actors to patient zero ransomware infections, our research team brings deep knowledge of the attacker landscape and tradecraft to create the innovations necessary to uncover even the most…

The Lazarus Effect: Healing Compromised Devices in the Internet of Small Things
October 2020
by Manuel Huber; et. al.
We live in a time when billions of IoT devices are being deployed and increasingly relied upon. This makes ensuring their availability and recoverability in case of a compromise a paramount goal. The large and rapidly growing number of deployed IoT devices make manual recovery impractical, especially if the devices are dispersed over a large area. Thus, there is a need for a reliable and scalable remote recovery mechanism that works even after attackers have…

Robust P2P Primitives Using SGX Enclave
October 2020
by Yaoqi Jia; et. al.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as BitTorrent and Bitcoin are susceptible to serious attacks from byzantine nodes that join as peers. Due to well-known impossibility results for designing P2P primitives in unrestricted byzantine settings, research has explored many adversarial models with additional assumptions, ranging from mild (such as preestablished PKI) to strong (such as the existence of common random coins). One such widely-studied model is the generalomission model, which yields simple protocols with good efficiency, but…
