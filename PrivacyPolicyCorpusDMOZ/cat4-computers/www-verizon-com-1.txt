Here's a summary of our Privacy Policy.
We are committed to strong and meaningful privacy protections. Our Privacy Policy details the information we collect, how we use and share it, and the choices you have about how your information is used and shared. Weve summarized key elements of the policy here for your convenience.
What information does Verizon collect?
We collect information you provide to us, about your use of our products and services and about your interactions with us. We also collect information about how our network and your devices are working, including the location of your wireless devices. We also obtain information about you from other companies, such as credit, demographic and interest information. Learn more
How does Verizon use information?
We use information to provide you with services and enhance your experiences with us. This includes delivering and maintaining your products, services, and your account and billing records; developing new products and services; personalizing your experiences; and delivering marketing offers to you. Learn more
Does Verizon share my information?
We share information within Verizon. Choices you make about the uses of your Verizon information are respected when information is shared with Verizon Media.
We do not sell or share information that individually identifies you outside of Verizon and its affiliate companies unless work is being performed on our behalf, you have given consent, or we have notified you through our privacy policies or other agreements that we have with you. We may also share certain non-personally identifiable information with third parties. Learn more
Does Verizon have programs that allow other companies to use information about me?
We have optional programs that allow Verizon and third parties to show you advertisements that are more personalized and useful to you or to help third parties verify your identity. Another program develops insights by analyzing de-identified customer information and reporting on aggregate behaviors. Learn more
What choices do I have about uses of my information?
You have choices about how Verizon reaches you with marketing and whether certain types of information may be shared within Verizon for marketing purposes. You also have choices about other uses of your information, such as for our advertising and insights programs, for verification purposes, and for certain uses of device information. Learn more
How does Verizon protect my information, and how do I update my account details?
We have a variety of safeguards in place to help protect your information against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We provide methods for you to access, review and update your account information. Learn more
Do I have specific rights under privacy laws in the United States?
You may have additional rights under the Cable Act and state laws, including California, Nevada and Maine privacy laws. Learn more
How do I learn about changes to this privacy policy?
We periodically update our privacy policy. If we change the way we use or disclose information that identifies you in a way that is materially different from what was stated in our privacy policy at the time the information was collected, you will be given an opportunity to update your choices about the new use or disclosure.
