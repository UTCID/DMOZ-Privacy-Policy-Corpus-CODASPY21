We may also receive Personal Data about you from other sources, including:
Third-party lead providers from whom we have purchased Personal Data. We may combine this information with Personal Data provided by you. This “Lead Data” may include business contact data, social media data, and usage data (including web user behavior and IP addresses).
Consumer reporting agencies or other background investigation or credit check service providers in connection with our collection of Human Resources Data and Reputation and Creditworthiness Data.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies.
When you use the Services, we collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons. For example, when you visit our website, we may place cookies on your computer.
Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies can contain and/or automatically collect information, such as a user identification code or IP address, which a website will use to track the pages and number of times you have visited, allowing us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. The data read from these cookies may be linked to Personal Data. In many cases, you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.
Cookies fall into the subcategories below.
Essential Cookies. Certain cookies are used for specific purposes that are essential to your secure use and navigation of our website. Without them, TCP may not be able to provide core website functions and features to you, and the website would not operate as well as you or TCP would like. These cookies collect and use information such as your server preferences, single-session data and corresponding identifier, web beacons and log files (detailed below), and other credential-related information. For EU individuals, essential cookies also help inform TCP whether you require, or have already been served, an affirmative consent request in connection with the GDPR. Essential cookies include analytics cookies, which provide us data that allows TCP to better understand its users and improve the website based on what we have learned from that data.
Preference Cookies. Other cookies are used to collect and process information about your preferences and similar choices in connection with the website in order to optimize your browsing. Preference cookies include social media cookies, which collect information about your social media usage and other data you may have provided in connection with such usage (if you access the website through a social media website or mobile application, you may have social media cookies). If you wish to modify or change your social media cookies, please visit and review the settings on your applicable social media account(s).
Advertising Cookies. To help support the Services and further tailor your experience, TCP uses Google Analytics as a third-party vendor. For information on how Google Analytics uses data, please visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners sites or apps”, located at http://bit.ly/2jXZ13Y.
We encourage you to consider keeping your cookies enabled because if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from certain features of the website, particularly the features that are designed to personalize your experience.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but generally allow users to modify their browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, to accept cookies only from certain websites, and/or to refuse all cookies.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without reference to Personal Data. For example, we use information we collect about website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Data. This policy applies to the information when we associate it with your Personal Data.
Although our website does not currently have a mechanism to recognize the various web browser “Do Not Track” signals, we do offer individuals choices to manage their preferences, as described above. We do expect our third-party adverting partners to use reasonable efforts to respect browser “Do Not Track” signals by not delivering targeted advertisements to website visitors whose browsers have a “Do Not Track” setting enabled. However, we understand that some companies do not have this capability today. To learn more about browser tracking signals and “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org/ .

Cookies and Tracking Technologies.
Pursuant to TCP’s legitimate business interests and/or your consent, TCP may use information obtained via Cookies and tracking technologies to personalize and optimize your browsing experience and the Services by:
Providing you tailored content and ads;
Enabling social media features;
Safeguarding against spam and malware;
Analyzing trends, traffic, and user behavior;
Administering the website;
Gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole;
Tracking web and advertising analytics throughout our website and our affiliate websites;
Remembering your preferences and voluntarily-submitted information;
Performing location-related functionalities and analytics;
Participating in market research; and
to improve the Services.
TCP may disclose this information to Service Providers, including those used for website and application development and support, IT support, security and hosting, and marketing and promotions management.
Data Sales.
TCP does not and will not sell or rent your Personal Data.
Data Retention.
TCP will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, or as otherwise required for other legitimate legal purposes. TCP has implemented a Data Retention Policy for all types of Personal Data that TCP processes. Personal Data is generally retained in accordance with the retention schedules defined therein. When the retention period has expired, Personal Data will be securely deleted or destroyed.
Protection of Personal Data.
TCP has implemented and maintains commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and physical controls to protect Personal Data from misuse or accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, acquisition or access. In each case, TCP will strive to provide security that is proportional to the sensitivity of the Personal Data being protected, with the greatest effort being focused on protecting sensitive Personal Data and other Personal Data whose compromise could result in substantial harm or inconvenience.
Please note that you should also take steps to protect your data. For example, when you register for the Services, choose a strong password, and do not share it with anyone else. TCP will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.
In the event TCP learns of a data security breach, TCP (potentially with the help of others such as third-party forensic investigators, legal counsel, and TCP’s insurance provider) shall investigate and document the facts relating thereto, its effects and the remedial actions taken and shall notify you within a reasonable period of time to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.
International Data Transfers.
TCP is headquartered in the United States of America. Your Personal Data may be stored and processed by TCP in the United States and TCP may transfer Personal Data pertaining to individuals located outside of the United States to our affiliates and suppliers in the United States, as permitted by applicable Data Protection Laws. Therefore, your Personal Data may be processed outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA. In this event, we will ensure that such recipient offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by verifying that the recipient is Privacy Shield certified (TCP is self-certified - see the Timeclock Plus LLC Privacy Shield Privacy Policy for Data Transferred to the United States from the EU/Switzerland/UK, below), by entering into standard contractual clauses for
the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or by asking for your prior consent to such transfer.
Your Rights & Choices.
Communication Preferences.
TCP will send direct marketing materials if you have provided opt-in consent or if applicable Data Protection Laws otherwise permit. You have the right to opt-out of these communications. To opt-out of commercial emails, simply click the link labeled “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email we send you. Additionally, you may opt-in or opt-out of communications by calling us at +1 (325) 223-9500. Please note that if you are currently receiving services from TCP and you have decided to opt-out of promotional emails, this will not impact the messages we send to you for purposes of delivering such services.
Review, Correction, Erasure, and Other Individual Rights.
You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data maintained by or on behalf of TCP unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Data Protection Laws. If the Personal Data is incorrect, incomplete, or not processed in compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws or this Privacy Policy, you have the right to have the Personal Data rectified, restricted, or erased (as appropriate) subject to applicable Data Protection Law.
Additionally, you have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data on the basis of compelling grounds related to your particular situation or in connection with any direct marketing communications. Restrictions may be lifted if they were temporary, based on certain grounds such as a dispute about data accuracy or the lawfulness of processing or if TCP is in the process of reviewing an objection request, and the basis of the restriction has been resolved. You will be notified about the removal of any such restriction via email or mail. In addition, once a restriction has been implemented, processing can only resume if you grant explicit consent or you request to lift the original restriction and there is no conflict with applicable Data Protection Laws.
You may contact us using the contact information provided in the “Contact Us” section below to request access to your data and to exercise any of the other individual rights afforded to you by applicable Data Protection Laws. TCP will receive, investigate, document, and respond to requests as soon as possible and in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws. In cases where the request cannot be fulfilled by TCP, we will use best efforts to notify any third-party processing relevant data of the required correction and/or erasure.
In some cases, requests to delete data may be denied in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws, including, for example, when the data is still needed for processing, where you gave consent and did not withdraw consent, where there has been a previous processing objection that has been granted, and where the data was processed lawfully or there is a not a legal requirement to delete the data. TCP may also reject the request if it needs access to the data to comply with a law, defend a legal claim or for research/historic/scientific purposes.
Individuals Located in the EEA.
In addition to the rights stated above and below, you also have the right to data portability, as well as the right to be notified of automated decision-making or profiling related to your Personal Data.
Individuals in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland
Individuals located in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland may file a complaint if they believe TCP has violated this policy or applicable Data Protection Law. Please see TimeClock Plus, LLC’s Privacy Shield Privacy Policy for Data Transferred to the United States from the EU/Switzerland/UK for additional information concerning how you may file such a complaint. TCP’s Data Protection Officer will receive, investigate, and document each complaint and respond within a reasonable timeframe in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws of the outcome of the investigation.

If your request is subject to any exception, we may deny your request to delete your data.
Please note that you must verify your identity and request before further action is taken by us. To do so, we may request certain information from you, including a copy of a government-issued ID or other identifier.
To exercise these rights, you may contact us at: DPO@TimeClockPlus.com or 1-800-749-8463. You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

TimeClock Plus, LLC Privacy Policy for the Processing of Biometric Data from U.S. Residents
Introduction.
Not all TCP products and services utilize biometric authentication, and not all of TCP’s biometric products and services require TCP’s participation in the collection, storage or use of biometric data. However, in some cases, TCP may provide hosting services for certain biometric data collected by Clients on such Client’s behalf. TCP has instituted the following policy related to any U.S. resident biometric data that is collected, processed and/or stored by TCP and that is subject to the requirements of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), or any similar law expressly governing the collection, storage, use and/or disclosure of biometric data.
Biometric Information.
The biometric data covered by this policy includes “Biometric Identifiers” as defined by BIPA (i.e., a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry) and “Biometric Information” as defined by BIPA (i.e., any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s Biometric Identifier used to identify an individual). With respect to its own employees, TCP may collect, store and /or use biometric data directly for the purpose of authenticating TCP employees, tracking their time and attendance, and for other human resources-related purposes. TCP will inform any such employees, in writing and prior to collection of biometric data, that biometric data is being collected, stored, and/or used and of the specific purpose(s) and length of time for which it is being collected, stored, and/or used and will obtain a written release regarding the same. At the direction and on behalf of its Clients, TCP
may also collect, store and/or use biometric data. Clients may utilize TCP’s products and services to collect, store and/or use biometric data solely for employment-related purposes, including tracking of time and attendance, in accordance with this policy and applicable law.
Client’s Responsibilities.
Clients must maintain their own data collection, disclosure, retention, and storage policies in compliance with applicable law, including BIPA.
TCP Clients agree that any use of TCP’s products and services to collect, store and/or use biometric data shall be in compliance with applicable law. With respect to any and all biometric data collected or controlled by Clients, Clients must (unless Client and TCP are expressly exempted under applicable law):
Inform the individual from whom biometric data will be collected, in writing and prior to collecting his or her biometric data, that biometric data is being collected, stored, and/or used;
Indicate, in writing, the specific purpose(s) (which may not be other than employment-related purposes) and length of time for which biometric data is being collected, stored, and/or used; and
Receive a written release from the individual (or his or her legally authorized representative) authorizing the Client, TCP, and TCP’s third-party service providers (who are subject to restrictions no less restrictive than those imposed on TCP herein) to collect, store, and/or use the biometric data and authorizing the Client to disclose such biometric data to TCP and TCP’s third-party service providers.
