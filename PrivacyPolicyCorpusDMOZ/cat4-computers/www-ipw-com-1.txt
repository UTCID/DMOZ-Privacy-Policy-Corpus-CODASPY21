Cookies and Pixel Tags
Our Sites use “Cookie” technology. “Cookies” are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Our Sites require the use of a “Session” Cookie when accessing the online traveler community. “Session” Cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once You close your internet browser. Session Cookies allow You to log-in and then view and update your content throughout the Sites during the same session or visit. Our Sites use a “Persistent” Cookie to direct You to the correct country/language version of our Sites for subsequent visits. Persistent Cookies remain on your computer until You delete them or are otherwise removed upon expiration. We do not use Cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about You apart from what You voluntarily provide us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files. Most browsers have an option to reject or disable cookies, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing You to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Although You can block cookies and similar technology, your experience of the Sites and Services could be affected by doing so.
Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Sites and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you. Our Sites use pixel tags to track the aggregate number of page views made on our Sites by all Sites visitors. We also use social media pixels in compliance with the policies of the various social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to track cookies. These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites in order to tailor the advertising messages that users see while visiting that social media website. Our email service provider uses pixel tags to determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider send email in a format You can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. Pixel tags also allow Us to know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us.
Promotions
We have strategic marketing relationships with select third party organizations (e.g., American Express) to offer certain travel related products and services at discounted prices. As part of the purchase process for these products and services You will be required to provide Personal Information such as your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. This information will be used by Us and will be provided to the associated third party organizations (e.g., hotel, credit card processor) to execute the transaction. As part of these promotions You will also be given a choice to opt-in into periodic emails from U.S. Travel and the organizations We have selected to offer promotions so that We can keep You informed of future offers and promotions that may be of interest. Please note that there are specific terms and conditions that will be unique to each promotion. An example is the requirement to be a member of the loyalty program for a hotel brand that is included in the promotion. You should carefully review the terms and conditions associated with each promotion before making a purchase.
Securing Your Information
The Personal Information You provide is encrypted and sent to Us using a secure method. We treat personal information You provide as confidential information, and We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. After Personal Information reaches U.S. Travel, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access.
However, please understand that no one can provide an absolute guarantee that information intended to be maintained as private, whether transmitted via the Internet or otherwise, cannot be accessed inappropriately or unlawfully by third parties. We have taken and will continue to take reasonable steps to ensure the secure and safe transmission of your personal information. You understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that use of the Sites is invulnerable to all security breaches, and that U.S. Travel makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of any portion of our Sites is protected from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities.
