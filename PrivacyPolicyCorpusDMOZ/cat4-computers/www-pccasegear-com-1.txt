5.2 All updates and modifications to the Website including any changes to the Content, Online Store, and all product and service pricing and offerings will be subject to these Terms. Any information we provide in relation to the availability of products is a guide only and is subject to change without notice. We will not be liable for any lack of availability of products that you may order through the Website.

6. Pricing
6.1 All transactions are processed in Australian Dollars.
6.2 Prices are inclusive of goods and services tax. In all other respects prices are exclusive of taxes, duties and charges imposed or levied in Australia in connection with the supply of goods or services.

7.1 Payment for an Order is made through the Online Store to have your Order delivered to you using one of our third party couriers.
7.2 We accept Online Payment using VISA and MasterCard credit cards, PayPal, Klarna and zipMoney.
7.3 We only accept credit cards issued in Australia. The credit card holder must be either the billing or shipping recipient. All PayPal orders will ship to the registered PayPal address.

7.5 If we are unable to successfully process your credit card for your Order that is accepted by us, then we may cancel your Order.
7.6 You must not pay, or attempt to pay, for Orders through any fraudulent or unlawful means.
7.7 We will provide you with a receipt at time of ordering (in respect of Online Payments) which specifies the total fees and charges for the products and services in your Order. These details are also available under your Account for you to refer to or print at any time for the period that your Account remains active.
8. Delivery of Orders
8.1 We offer the choice of shipping using StarTrack and Australia Post eParcel (Third Party Couriers). Shipping and delivery of Orders will be in accordance with the delivery terms of the Third Party Couriers.
8.2 You must provide a physical delivery address where someone is likely to be available to accept the delivery of your Order during business hours. You may be required by the Third Party Couriers to provide proof of identification for verification checks, in accordance with their delivery terms. Should the address provided be incorrect and the freight returned to us, you will be responsible for any additional freight cost or return to sender fees.
8.3 Shipping costs are influenced by the size and weight of the products in your Order and your location. You can see the pricing on the available shipping options by entering your post code into the freight calculator. This calculator appears on the lower half of the screen when you add items to your cart.
8.4 We aim to ship all Orders, where products are in stock, within 1-2 business days. If for any reason we are unable to dispatch your Order we will notify you within 2 business days. Shipping times are estimated at between 1-7 business days depending on your location within Australia, but are subject to the delivery terms of the Third Party Couriers.
8.5 Claims for damage in transit, incorrect delivery or incorrect item receipt must be reported in writing within 3 days of delivery. There is no cover offered for issues reported after this time frame.
8.6 Orders shipped using the Australia Post On Demand option are shipped in accordance with the cut off and delivery times specified in checkout. Parcels will be delivered regardless of whether someone is available to accept the delivery. No claims for loss/non receipt can be made when using this service as you are guaranteeing your availability to accept delivery. Service available to selected Victorian postcodes only.
9. Risk and title
9.1 If you elect to have your Order delivered to you using one of the Third Party Couriers, then title to the products in your Order passes to you upon delivery.
10. Returns and refunds of an order and warranties
10.1 We do not normally provide a refund if you have simply changed your mind about an Order, so please choose carefully.
10.2 In order to obtain a refund, exchange or to repair a product purchased from PCCG, including those products which carry a manufacturer's warranty, you must have clear proof of purchase; typically, a receipt or invoice. Original shipping costs for the product are non-refundable as this service has been provided in full.
10.3 To return your product (including warranty returns for faulty products, or where you have been sent the wrong item), please go to your Account and click on "Returns and Service Department" to fill in the appropriate request form. We will review your request, and at our option, issue you a Return Authorisation number. If we issue you a Return Authorisation number, please clearly print it on the outside of the package when returning your product to us. You acknowledge that by issuing you with a Return Authorisation number, we are not representing that your warranty claim is valid or that you will be entitled to have your product repaired or replaced, or a refund provided in relation to that product.
10.4
Your rights under a product warranty are separate to and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to you under Australian law, including under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). In relation to returning faulty products, warranty periods are strictly enforced by manufacturers (and in relation to PCCG Custom System Products, which is defined in clause 178.1, by us). If a claim is made under a warranty, it is very important that you immediately apply for a Return Authorisation number as soon as you become aware of the need to do so. When we receive your product, we will assess whether the product has a fault and can be accepted as a warranty claim. We may be required to consult with the manufacturer or their repair agent to determine the fault and resolution. If we have to send your product to the manufacturer or their repair agent, we will ask them to assess the product and provide their assessment within a reasonable timeframe. Where the assessment finds that there is no fault with the product, or that the product has been damaged due to use of the product by you for a purpose for which it is not intended, outside its recommended parameters or specifications, or circumstances otherwise beyond our control, we may require, at our option, that you compensate us for any fees incurred by us in relation to the assessment. Once your product assessment is completed, we will inform you whether your warranty claim is accepted, and subject to clause 17, whether we will repair, replace or refund your product.

17. Indemnity
You will fully indemnify PCCG in respect of all loss, damage, costs, expenses (including legal fees on a full indemnity basis), fines, penalties, claims, demands and proceedings howsoever arising, whether at common law (including negligence) or under statute, in connection with any of the following:
(a) any breach of these Terms by you;
(b) your use of the Website; or
(c) your communications with PCCG
18. Warranties, consumer guarantees and limitation of liability
18.1 For the purposes of this clause 18:
Non-PCCG Product means any product sold on the Website, except for PCCG Custom System Products;
PCCG Custom System Product means the custom system that is assembled by PCCG under our custom system assembly service; and
Products means Non-PCCG Products and PCCG Custom System Products.
18.2 Any representation, warranty, condition, guarantee or undertaking that would be implied in these Terms by legislation, common law, equity, trade, custom or usage is excluded to the maximum extent permitted by law, including any implied warranties of acceptable quality or fitness for a disclosed purpose.
18.3 Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantee, right or remedy conferred on you by the Australian Consumer Law, Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (ACL) or any other applicable law that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified by agreement.
18.4 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the liability of PCCG for a breach of a non-excludable guarantee referred to in clause 18.3 is limited, at PCCG's option, to:
(a) in the case of goods supplied or offered by us, any one or more of the following:
(i) the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
(ii) the repair of the goods;
(iii) the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or
(iv) the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
(b) in the case of services supplied or offered by us:
(i) the supplying of the services again; or
(ii) the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
18.5 Subject to clause 18.7, you acknowledge and agree that, PCCG is not the manufacturer or producer of any Non-PCCG Product, and the only warranties offered in respect of a Non-PCCG Product are those of the manufacturer, not PCCG. Except as expressly set out in these Terms and to the extent permitted by law including the ACL, PCCG does not make or will not be deemed to have made any:
(a) warranty or representation, express or implied, as to:
(i) the title, condition, design, operation, acceptable quality or fitness for purpose of any product (or any part thereof);
(ii) the absence of any latent or other defects;
(iii) the absence of any infringement of any intellectual property rights (including copyright and patents);
(iv) the absence of obligations based on strict liability in tort; or
(b) other representation, guarantee or warranty whatsoever, express or implied,
with respect to any Product or any part thereof or services sold on the Website.
18.6 Subject to clause 18.7, PCCG provides a 2 year return-to-base warranty on labour for all PCCG Custom System Products (PCCG Custom System Warranty). The PCCG Custom System Warranty commences from the date of delivery of the PCCG Custom System Product to you. Where it can be proved in accordance with clause 10.4 that there is a fault with a Non-PCCG Product component in the PCCG Custom System Product , this warranty covers:
(a) the return of the PCCG Custom System Product to PCCG;
(b) PCCG replacing the faulty Non-PCCG Product component with a replacement; and
(c) PCCG delivering the PCCG Custom System Product back to you.
If you encounter any issues with the PCCG Custom System Product outside the PCCG Custom System Warranty, you will need to identify what you believe is the faulty Non-PCCG Product component, and return that component to us in accordance with the normal warranty procedure in clause 10.4, for us to assess whether that component is faulty and can be accepted as a warranty claim.
18.7 In addition to any manufacturers' warranties for Non-PCCG Products and the PCCG Custom System Warranty, the Products and services sold on the Website come with certain consumer guarantees.
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. PCCG does not have to pay for damages or losses that (i) are not caused by PCCG’s failure to meet a consumer guarantee, or (ii) are not reasonably foreseeable.
18.8 The consumer guarantees under the ACL have no set time limit, and depending on the price and quality of the Product, you may be entitled to a remedy even after any manufacturers' warranty for Non-PCCG Products, or the PCCG Custom System Warranty, has expired. In that circumstance, PCCG recommends that:
(a) in relation to Non-PCCG Products, you contact the manufacturer's customer assistance department directly. Although the manufacturer's warranty has expired, the manufacturer may assess the nature, cause and extent of a failure or fault if you believe your consumer guarantees have been breached. If you are not satisfied with the manufacturer's remedy, then please contact us (see clause 21) for assistance; or
(b) in relation to PCCG Custom System Products, you contact us directly (see clause 21) for assistance.
18.9 PCCG will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss or damage, loss of profits or anticipated profits, economic loss, loss of business opportunity, loss of data, loss of reputation or loss of revenue (irrespective of whether the loss or damage is caused by or relates to breach of contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise) arising in connection with the Website, the Content, all links to or from the Website or the goods and services advertised or purchased from the Website other than losses that 1) resulted from PCCG’s failure to meet a consumer guarantee; and 2) are reasonably foreseeable.
18.10 Subject to this clause 18, to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree that the the maximum aggregate liability of PCCG for all proven losses, damages and claims arising out of or in connection with these Terms or a supply under these Terms, including liability for breach, in negligence or in tort or for any other common law or statutory action, is limited to the sum of $100.
19. Termination of your access to the Website
PCCG may at any time immediately terminate your access (including restricting access) to the Website or any feature of the Website for any reason (including due to your breach or alleged breach of these Terms) in its sole discretion and without prior notice. Any indemnities given by you and any limitations of our liability survive such termination.
20. Jurisdiction and law
These Terms are governed by and must be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. You submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that State and the Commonwealth of Australia in respect of all matters arising out of or relating to these Terms, their performance and subject matter.
21. Severability
Each provision of these Terms is severable from the others and no severance of a provision will affect any other provision.
