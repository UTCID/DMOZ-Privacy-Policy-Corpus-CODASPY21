ExpertRating Solutions ("ExpertRating") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have established this privacy policy to communicate our information practices through this statement, pertaining to the collection, use and protection of the personal information we collect. This privacy policy applies exclusively to the website
www.expertrating.com, owned and operated by Expert Rating Solutions. By using this website, you are providing your consent to the privacy practices disclosed within this statement.
What type of user related information do we collect?
ExpertRating collects personal information from users of the website at different points of registration. Whether registering as affiliate partner, for an employer account or as an individual user, we collect personal information to facilitate your requested service. This collected personal information includes name, email and physical address, phone number, and PayPal I.D. where applicable. When you supply your credit card information, it is not retained on file by us. When users register for a ‘Live Proctored’ exam, we may also collect, during the proctored session, information such as a web cam photo I.D., a list of applications running on your system and geographical location, in order to maintain the integrity of the proctored session. You may contact us at ExpertRating Help Desk  to request for the removal of your information from our database.
Information collection during re-certification on ExpertRating - When you apply for re-certification, the website collects information related to your previous and current employment. You will be asked for your previous employer's address and current employer's address. This information is solely used for determining whether you are eligible for re-certification without re-taking the test.
How does ExpertRating use my information?
ExpertRating does not send any unsolicited messages to the registered users of the website. We use your collected information to register accounts, provide access to the services requested, process payments and provide customer service. ExpertRating reserves the right to send to users, notification, administrative and service emails, which are a part of the service. Consequently, you cannot opt out of these communications.
Our commitment to data security
Your personal information is kept strictly confidential through a security system, which only allows access to critical information to the company's security team members. This team consists of experienced engineers and staff who are under stringent confidentiality requirements. The security system is backed by the latest technology and ensures that your personal information is fully protected. Your ExpertRating profile, which is available to you in your login area, is protected through a password. You are advised to keep this password confidential and to ensure that you close the browser window after logging out from ExpertRating, especially if you are using a shared computer. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we do our utmost to protect your personal information, ExpertRating cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure the security of your information on our systems.
Our commitment to payment information (credit card number) security
ExpertRating services can be purchased online through a secure credit card transaction using any major credit card or PayPal. The ecommerce functionality on the site has been provided by PayPal, which is a trusted name in online transaction processing. When you supply your credit card information, it is not retained on file by us. Moreover, the transaction takes place on the PayPal secure server, which is 100% safe and encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). When you buy any of our services, it is treated as a sale and your credit card will not be charged again in the future as is the case in subscription sales. These third-party agents do not share your sensitive information with any third parties and have no authorization to use your personal information for any unsolicited purposes.
How you can access or correct your personal information
ExpertRating Solutions will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access and change the personal information that we collect and maintain by logging in to your user account with the username and passwords assigned to your account. You can delete your account and personal information by sending us a request through email or phone. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at ExpertRating Help Desk. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
