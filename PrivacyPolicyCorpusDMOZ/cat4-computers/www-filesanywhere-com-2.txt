Any change to these Terms of Use will be made publicly available on this website by clicking the "Terms of Use" link at the bottom of the home page. Continued use of the service is construed as your acceptance of the Terms of Use. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current Terms because they are binding on you. Certain provisions of these Terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages at this site.
2. Changes to FilesAnywhere Service. Officeware Corporation reserves the right to change or discontinue FilesAnywhere at any time, with or without notice.

Further, Officeware Corporation shall not be liable for forwarding or retrieving documents.
3. No Liability for Data Stored on FilesAnywhere. FilesAnywhere assumes no liability for any of the data that is stored on the FilesAnywhere service, be it obscene, offensive, illegal, or if it is an infringement of property rights of anyone. Individual users are solely responsible for the file content they upload and store on this service.
4. Individual Account Security, Privacy, and Personal Use. You agree that you are the only person responsible for the security of your account and FilesAnywhere is not. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify FilesAnywhere immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. FilesAnywhere will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by FilesAnywhere or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account at any time without the permission of the account holder.
5. Grant of License, Non-Transferable Membership. FilesAnywhere grants you a limited license to access and make personal use of FilesAnywhere and not to download (other than page changing) or modify the website or any other products of FilesAnywhere, or any portion of them, except with express written consent of FilesAnywhere. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of FilesAnywhere or its contents; any derivative use of FilesAnywhere or its contents; or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. FilesAnywhere may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without written consent of FilesAnywhere.

You may not use meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing FilesAnywhere names or trademarks without the express written consent of FilesAnywhere. Any unauthorized use terminates the permission or license granted by FilesAnywhere. You are granted a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a hyperlink the homepage of FilesAnywhere.com so long as the link does not portray FilesAnywhere, or its products or service in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.

All rights not expressly granted by FilesAnywhere to you are retained.
6. Term. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and continue in effect thereafter until superseded or otherwise terminated in accordance with this Agreement (the “Term”). Each of the services ordered shall be provided for the term specified by you in your initial order (the “Initial Term”). After the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will be extended and automatically renew for the same amount of time as the Initial Term until either party terminates in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement. Each extension and automatic renewal shall be deemed a Renewal Term. This Agreement may not be terminated by you during the Initial Term or during a Renewal Term unless such termination is to be effective on the last day of such Initial Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be, such that no extension or automatic renewal will take place. You acknowledge and agree that your commitment to each Initial Term and Renewal Term is an important factor in FilesAnywhere’s decision to agree to the pricing in this Agreement. However, you may terminate the Agreement prior to the end of the applicable Initial Term or Renewal Term if you (i) notify FilesAnywhere before the next billing period of such termination and (ii) pay FilesAnywhere all amounts already paid plus all amounts due under this Agreement through the end of the current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be, such that 100% of all remaining amounts due for the remainder of such Initial Term or Renewal Term are paid (the “Early Cancellation Fee”). If FilesAnywhere terminates the Agreement for your breach, you shall pay the Early Cancellation Fee in addition to, and not instead of, any other remedies provided elsewhere in this Agreement, or by law, including without limitation FilesAnywhere’s right to seek injunctive relief and to sue for damages. Upon termination of this Agreement, we shall provide you with the information, assistance, and cooperation, as you may reasonably request, to assure an orderly return or transfer of your Materials to you or your designee.
6.a. Fees. If you choose to subscribe to a paid Service, you agree to pay the fees ("Fees") as quoted to you when you purchase that Service. We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase. You are responsible for all charges related to using the purchased Service (for example, data charges and currency exchange settlements).

Upon termination of your membership subscription, by non-payment, cancellation, or suspension of service, this agreement will automatically terminate and the license to use FilesAnywhere under this agreement shall be permanently revoked. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD MUST BE KEPT PRIVATE AND MAY NOT BE USED BY ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR AUTOMATED PROCESS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT UNLESS THEY ALSO HAVE AN ASSIGNED USER LICENSE OR "SUBACCOUNT" USER LICENSE.

The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge or extend these limits. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liabilities, so the above limitations may not apply to you.
