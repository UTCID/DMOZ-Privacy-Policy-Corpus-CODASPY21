Any termination of this Agreement shall not relieve you of any obligations to pay fees and costs accrued prior to the termination date. Knight Web Services® Inc. shall not be obligated to notify any third party of the termination of your account or provide any termination assistance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Knight Web Services® Inc. shall have no obligation to forward any email messages, data, information or other content related to your use of the Services, and you acknowledge that all such email messages, data, information and content may be immediately deleted by Knight Web Services® Inc.
