tailored to your individual wants and needs. We also recognize the importance
of protecting personally identifiable information relating to you, our users

by such individuals. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature,

Under no circumstances will we give specific, identifiable information about
our users to outside third parties. However, we will, from time to time, provide
advertisers or potential advertisers with aggregated, anonymous information
about our users. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided
by subscribers as part of an advertiser promotion within one of our partner
sites may be provided to such advertisers as needed for the reasonable administration
of the promotion. We also reserve the right to amend these policies at any time
by updating this page so check back often as your right may change ongoing.
we reserve the right to sell our business and in some cases that may include
data that is gathered at our websites If this is the case you will receive an
initial opt out message from new management and at that time may opt out of
further messages.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet.
These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology

these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site
and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown,
the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information
can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.
If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading
cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web
site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out
of all network advertising cookies. Click

review the third-party advertising companies’ privacy policies.
A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may
be required in certain instances. For example, if we run competitions or contests
on the site, you may be required to provide information such as your address
in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific
rules for any contest will state how that information may be used. We may also
use personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes.

promotions, or services pertaining to our site.
We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers,
sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Users should also be
aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas,
bulletin boards, or other public forums, such information may be collected by
others and may result in the receipt of unsolicited messages.
Children: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information
about yourself - like your name, address, or e-mail address - over the Internet,
to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online.
Parents: We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage
and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. We will not
knowingly gather personally identifiable information from children under the
age of 13 when at all possible.

business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above.
Finally you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or
her name, e-mail address, etc. within various public forums (including bulletin
boards and chat rooms), such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages
from other parties.
Technology on the Internet is developing at a fever pace. It is critical that
AIMAwayMessages.com maintain its ability to rapidly adjust these policies in
the future. By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of
this information by AIMAwayMessages.com. If we decide to change our privacy
policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware
of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances
we disclose it.
