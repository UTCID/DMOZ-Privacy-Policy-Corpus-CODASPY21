IT Security Policy & Breach Plan Development
Home / Cybersecurity Services / IT Security Policy & Breach Plan Development
Worried about Data Security? We Have a Plan for That
Your business is only as secure as your data. If you don’t have a plan to keep your data and confidential information secure, is it really safe? How do you know if your plan is being implemented and followed? Well, we have a plan for all of that.
We learned early that privacy and security should be built into everything we do and that keeping our clients’ data safe is a wildly important corporate goal. What does that mean? It means that if we can’t keep your data safe, nothing else we do for you really matters.
And this philosophy has paid off. Trusted with more than 1.7 petabytes of data in our onsite Tier 3 datacenter, 500 leading corporations and law firms rely on TCDI’s services and solutions on a daily basis.

Why Develop an IT Security Policy & Breach Plan?Important Security Policies You Should HaveSecurity Policy Development & Planning Only Works If Everyone Uses ItYou know that saying, “A goal without a plan is just a wish?” That’s the approach we take when it comes to IT security. There are a broad array of actions and responsibilities to consider that fall under the umbrella of policies, procedures, assessments, and general compliance. Some may consider these things the softer side of data security, but they are just as important.Security policy development gives you a secure foundation by formalizing and implementing policies and procedures designed around cybersecurity best practices. Whether drafting policies from scratch or reviewing existing policies for gaps, the TCDI team takes a holistic approach to security policy development by applying its unique blend of technical, legal, and regulatory expertise.There are several information security policies that are important to have in place, including:
Incident Response
Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity
Technology Acceptable Use
Remote Access
Backups
Data Encryption
Risk Management
Physical Security
Password Best Practices
Privacy
Change Control
Wireless Access
The success and value of your security policy lie in how well employees and others adhere to it. For example, if a policy requires laptops to use encryption, but only 50% of the laptops are actually encrypted, then there is a policy implementation and adherence problem.
That’s why our job is not done once policies are put into written form. We take it a few steps farther and work directly with you to develop a plan for effectively communicating your security policies, implementing any changes, and monitoring policy adherence. Our goal is to ensure information security policies are put into practice and seamlessly integrated into daily business activities.
