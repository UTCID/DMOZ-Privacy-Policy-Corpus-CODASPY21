Privacy Policy:
SomeoneSentYouAGreeting ("SomeoneSentYouAGreeting")
operates someonesentyouagreeting.com and may operate other websites. It
is SomeoneSentYouAGreeting's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.Website VisitorsLike most website operators, SomeoneSentYouAGreeting collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SomeoneSentYouAGreeting's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how SomeoneSentYouAGreeting's visitors use its website. From time to
time, SomeoneSentYouAGreeting may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.SomeoneSentYouAGreeting also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on someonesentyouagreeting.com
blogs/sites. SomeoneSentYouAGreeting only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.Gathering of Personally-Identifying InformationCertain visitors to SomeoneSentYouAGreeting's websites choose to interact
with SomeoneSentYouAGreeting in ways that require SomeoneSentYouAGreeting to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SomeoneSentYouAGreeting gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at someonesentyouagreeting.com to provide a

SomeoneSentYouAGreeting. SomeoneSentYouAGreeting does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.Aggregated StatisticsSomeoneSentYouAGreeting may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. SomeoneSentYouAGreeting may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, SomeoneSentYouAGreeting does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying InformationSomeoneSentYouAGreeting discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on SomeoneSentYouAGreeting's behalf or to provide services available

property or rights of SomeoneSentYouAGreeting, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an SomeoneSentYouAGreeting website and have supplied your email address, SomeoneSentYouAGreeting
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
