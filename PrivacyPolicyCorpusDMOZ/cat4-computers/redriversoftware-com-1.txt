Almost every website uses cookie technology. The cookie is downloaded by your Internet browser the first time you visit a website. The next time you visit this website from the same device, the cookie and the information contained in it are either sent back to the originating website (first-party cookies) or to another website to which it belongs (third-party cookies). In that way, the website can detect that it has already been opened using this browser, and in some cases it will then vary the content it displays.Some cookies are extremely useful because they can improve your user experience when you return to a previously visited website. This assumes that you are using the same device and the same browser as before; if so, cookies will remember your preferences, will know how you use the website, and will adapt the content you are shown so that it is more relevant to your personal interests and needs. Your cookie settings on this website. Cookies on this website that do not require approval.Cookies that are essential, also known as ‘strictly necessary’ cookies, enable features without which you would not be able to use the website as intended. These cookies are used exclusively by Volaris and are therefore known as first-party cookies. They are only saved on your computer while you are actually browsing the website. An example of why strictly necessary cookies are used is to set the language of your preference when browsing this website.Another example of what these cookies do is facilitate a switch from HTTP to HTTPS when you change pages, so that the security of data transmitted is maintained. Furthermore, a cookie of this kind is used to store your decision about the use of cookies on our website. Your consent is not required for the use of strictly necessary cookies. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled without losing some of the features of this website. Categories of cookies.Based on what function cookies have and the purpose for which cookies are used, there are four categories of cookie: strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies and marketing cookies. Strictly necessary cookiesAre essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, some services cannot be provided – for example, remembering previous actions (e.g. the language in which you want to browse this site) when navigating back to a page in the same session. Performance cookiesGather information about how a website is used – for example, which pages a visitor opens most often, and whether the user receives error messages from some pages. These cookies do not save information that would allow the user to be identified. The collected information is aggregated, and therefore anonymous. These cookies are used exclusively to improve the performance of the website, and with it the user experience. Functional cookiesEnable a website to save information which has already been entered (such as user names, languages choices, and your location), so that it can offer you improved and more personalized functions. For example, a website can offer you local information if it uses a cookie to remember the region in which you are currently located. Functional cookies are also used to enable features you request such as playing videos. These cookies collect anonymous information and cannot track your movements on other websites. Marketing cookiesAre used to deliver adverts and other communications more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They remember whether you have visited a website or not, and this information can be shared with other parties such as advertisers. Cookies for improving group targeting and advertising will often be linked to site functionality provided by other organizations. Your cookie settings on this website. You can completely disable cookies in your browser at any time.It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of some features of our site, and we might not be able to provide some features you have previously chosen to use. How do I change my cookie settings?Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings.
