Privacy Policy
Last Updated and Effective Date:
March 17, 2020
YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the policies and practices of CGTech (sometimes referred to as “CGTech,” “us,” “we” or “our”) relating to the information we collect when you use our website (www.cgtech.com) or engage us with respect to our products and services (collectively, “Services”).
This Privacy Policy applies to our Services in the United States.
The creation of this Privacy Policy grows from our fundamental respect for your right to privacy and will serve to guide our relationship with you.
We value the privacy and security of your personal information, which as used herein means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
As such, we take complying with data privacy and security laws seriously.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide you with a description of our personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.
If you provided us with your personal information, or we obtain personal information about you from other sources, we treat your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.
HOW YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
You consent to and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy by expressly accepting the terms of the Privacy Policy or by using our Services.
From time to time, we will update this Privacy Policy as we adopt new practices and procedures related to your personal information.
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be placed here and will supersede this version.
If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Last Updated and Effective Date” above.
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND THE REASON FOR THE COLLECTION
We collect the following personal information from you when you engage or inquire about our Services, and describe below the reasons why we collect the personal information.
Information You Voluntarily Provide.
When you visit our website or contact us through other means, you may voluntarily provide information about yourself or your organization, including your name, title, company name and identification, email address, phone number, address, website, payment method, class to attend, preferences, product you purchased, device and operating system, and other information you provide related to your inquiry.
We collect this information so that we can provide services related to a new or existing license file, our education program, the VERICUT Reviewer, software updates, onsite or web-based training, a quote for implementation services, technical support, file upload services, registration for our conferences, and a response to your questions or inquires to customer service.
We may also collect personal information you voluntarily provide in person at trade shows or conferences so that we can respond to your inquiries regarding our Services
Information on Message Boards.
Registered users of our VERICUT Users’ Forum may voluntarily provide personal information about themselves and the issue for discussion on the message boards, which are open for public view.
The purpose of this message board is for the VERICUT community to communicate with each other regarding our Services.
Automatically from Website.

We collect this information so that we can improve and monitor use of our website and better understand our users and their preferences.
WHETHER WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS
We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
We may, however, share your personal information with services providers who assist us with payment processing and cloud-based software services.
We may also share your personal information if necessary to:
(1) comply with federal, state, or local laws; (2) comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, or local authorities; (3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that we reasonably and in good faith believe may violate federal, state, or local laws; or (4) exercise or defend legal claims.
Further, we may use and/or share non-personal information with other parties as long as the information has been deidentified or aggregated.
Lastly, we may transfer to a third party personal information as an asset that is part of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of our business.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We have implemented and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure.
However, no security system is perfect.
We will notify you if there is a breach of our security where required by law or deemed necessary.
