Bin Laden wants me dead.
I'm told this in the subject line of an e-mail that offers to help me stay alive.
For only $19.95 (plus $4 shipping), I can buy a manual for survival in case of germ or biological warfare.
The pitch is one of dozens of unsolicited commercial e-mails that fill my mailbox every day.
"Enhance your sex life."
"Eliminate all your bills."
"Lose weight fast and easy."
"Be your own boss."
They're as annoying as goose droppings. They waste time. They clog computers and raise the price of Internet service. Unfortunately, they're legal in Washington if the subject lines make it clear they're advertisements.
Washington has an anti-spam law, one of 18 in the nation, that prohibits commercial e-mail with misleading information in the subject line, an invalid or misleading reply address or a disguised path of transmission across the Internet.
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving Washington's law, one of the first to regulate spam. But the onus is on those who receive illegal spam to enforce the law. They can file suit in Superior Court for damages, or file a small-claims case.
Those who receive illegal spam also can forward it to the state Attorney General's Office. If the office receives a huge number of complaints about a particular e-mail or company, the state may file suit (www.wa.gov/ago/junkemail).
That's what happened in the case now going to trial in King County Superior Court. It's a dispute over millions of pieces of unsolicited e-mail sent by a Salem, Ore., man and his company.
Residents complained to Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire that they received spam advertising a $39.95 package called "How to Profit from the Internet."

The e-mail used a misleading subject line -- "Did I get the right e-mail address?" -- which the state considers a trick to deceive recipients into thinking the message came from acquaintances.
Ditto for e-mails using subjects such as "Re: your request" and "Re: vacation confirmation."
"It's a big problem for us," said Chris Jarvis of the Attorney General's Office.

I used to simply delete the stuff. But then I started getting pornographic spam with two or three pop-up boxes. In three weeks, I received 400 unsolicited e-mails. I put a block on some addresses, but the same messages began showing up with different addresses.
If the junk mail had been delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, I would know how to complain. The junk mailers must have a post office box or street address. And they have to pay postage on what they send.
Not so with spam. Often, the identities of e-mailers are false because, as Bill Gates said, "people sending out garbage don't want to take responsibility for it."
The senders don't pay for their mailings. Companies that carry Internet traffic pay the increased costs of transporting and processing the mail that passes through. When a server is tied up processing spam, it creates a drag on all of the mail, wanted and unwanted.
AOL has said that of 30 million e-mail messages each day, about 30 percent are unsolicited. AOL officials have estimated that $2 or $3 of every customer's monthly fee goes to handle spam.
A January 2001 report on spam by the European Commission estimated the cost of spam to businesses and consumers at $8 billion a year.
The other cost is the time spent sorting spam from personal and business messages. In "Stopping Spam -- Stamping Out Unwanted E-mail & News Posting," authors Alan Schwartz and Simson Garfinkel estimate that to be 3 or 4 seconds each. "Those seconds add up quickly: 1 million people clicking 'delete' corresponds to roughly a month of wasted human activity," they wrote.
"Or put another way, if you get six spam messages a day, you're wasting two hours each year deleting spam."
Enough already. Next time, I'll e-mail Gregoire. If I had two hours to waste, I'd be in line at Krispy Kreme.
