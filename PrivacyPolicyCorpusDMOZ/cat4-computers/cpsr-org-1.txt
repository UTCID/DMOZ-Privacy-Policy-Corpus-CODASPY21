Privacy Policy
It is necessary for CPSR to collect names, addresses and other
personal information of its members in and for the conduct of its
business.
"CPSR does not sell, rent, or share
its email lists or collect personally identifiable information at its
web site except as part of its secure, web-based membership
registration form. Membership and contribution information is never
sold, rented, lent, exchanged, or used for any purpose other than
official CPSR activity. CPSR may elect to send members mailing from
other groups, but these mailings will always originate with CPSR."
Only
the Managing Director, members of the Board of
Directors and established Group leaders are authorized to make use of
CPSR mailing lists, and only for the purpose of conducting CPSR
business. In the case of Group leaders, this applies only to the
portion of the mailing list that covers their Groups. Other members
of CPSR may request that messages be released to all or some portion of
the CPSR membership. If approved as above, the staff will make the
release, but the mailing list will not be sent to the requesting
person. Mailing lists are used for general announcements to the
membership, updating members on CPSR activities, as part of a program
for which the member has registered (e.g., Working Group postings) and for
solicitation for membership renewal. These services will provide an
easy way whereby the member may unsubscribe or opt to discontinue
receipt of such communications.
