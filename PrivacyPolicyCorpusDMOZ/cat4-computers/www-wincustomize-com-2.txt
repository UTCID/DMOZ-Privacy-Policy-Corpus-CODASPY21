By uploading Content, you give permission to Stardock to sell the Content via WinCustomize.com as well as on compilation CDs or packs via online means or retail as long as the payment terms are not modified without prior consent.
If you upload malicious, inappropriate material repeatedly, your account will be cancelled without notice.

GENERAL INFORMATION The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Stardock and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Stardock or WinCustomize.com (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the TOS). You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other Stardock services, third-party Content or third-party software.

You and Stardock agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Wayne, Michigan. The failure of Stardock to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
