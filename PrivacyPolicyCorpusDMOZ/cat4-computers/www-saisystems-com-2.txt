terms governing use of the Sites).
By submitting User-Generated Content, you represent and
warrant that:
You own or otherwise have the necessary rights to the
submitted User-Generated Content, including, where applicable, the right to
grant the rights to us under these Terms, and such User-Generated Content does

To the extent you submit User-Generated Content that

proprietary information, or use trademarks or service marks in an infringing
fashion; and
You are not, you are not acting on behalf of any person or
