DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) comes into force on the 1st January 2020. EIZO privacy practices are aligned with the requirements of the CCPA. If you are a California resident, please review our Privacy Policy to learn how we use and disclose your personal information, what rights you may have with regard to how we use your personal information, and how to exercise those rights.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information
EIZO may collect and process your personal information for business and commercial purposes as described in our Privacy Policy. We take the protection of your information seriously and are committed to ensuring the security of all customer data. New privacy regulations now require to give consumers a process for opting out of any potential practice where customer personal information might be sold. Although we do not sell personal information for monetary value, our actions may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.
For further information on our privacy practices, or to make a request in relation to your personal data, please review our Privacy Policy or contact us at feedback@eizo.com or 1-800-800-5202.
