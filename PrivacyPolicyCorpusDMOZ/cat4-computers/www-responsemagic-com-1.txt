Response Magic Contact and Opt Out Policy
The contact information contained within the Response Magic
accounts of our customers is private and confidential.  We
do not share or sell contact information to Response Magic
users.
Each contact within a Response Magic account may Opt Out of
receiving the emails being sent to them by the Response Magic
account owner at any time.  Each email sent by Response
Magic to a recipient contains a link at the bottom which allows
for the recipient to Opt Out of receiving emails.  In
addition, the recipient can choose to opt out of all future
emails by either that sender's Response Magic account or
globally.  If the contact chooses to opt out globally, the
email address they provide will be blocked by our system
completely, meaning that no Response Magic user can add that
email address to their system at any time in the future.
To globally opt out, please fill out the form found
here
Opt Outs are handled on an email address basis.  If a
recipient opts out, they will only be opting out to receive
emails to that specific email address.
Opt Out requests can only be reversed pending contact from
the opted-out recipient from the email address that was removed.

about the customers you collect within our services to send
any unsolicited messages or information, nor will we share
it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.
Cookies
Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called
"cookies" may be used to provide you with tailored
information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website
can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your
hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may
be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive
a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances
our ability to serve you and measure the utility of our website.
Information Security
We believe that keeping personal information secure is one
of our most significant responsibilities. We restrict access
to Personal Information about you to those employees and others
who need to know that information to assist us in our business,
or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard personal
information, according to established security standards and
procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural
safeguards for the information.
When we request customers to enter sensitive information
(such as the credit card number), it is encrypted and protected
with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon
at the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed
to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive
information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific
job (for example, our billing clerk, or a customer service
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
information.
