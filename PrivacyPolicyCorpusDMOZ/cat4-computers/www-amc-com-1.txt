We may change this Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the “Effective Date” above.  Use of the Services after the posted Effective Date means you accept the current version of the Policy, including any changes made prior to the posted Effective Date.

We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

3. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?
We collect the following categories of information about you:
Identifiers, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, and postal address;
Demographics, such as your gender and age;
Online activity information, such as your IP address or browsing history;
Location information that you provide or that we collect via your device, subject to your settings;
Inferences regarding preferences or other characteristics;
Transaction information, such as your cable provider, password, and viewing, subscription, and purchase histories or tendencies.
Payment information, such as payment card numbers; and
Audio, electronic, visual, olfactory, or similar information, such as photographs or voice recordings.
We collect personal information from you from a variety of sources, including:
From You: We collect information that you submit to us. When you personalize your profile, use the Services, or interact with us in other ways, including offline, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of the Services, such as a profile picture and birthday.  We collect any information that you voluntarily enter into any postings, comments or forums within the Services, including private messages you send to other users of the Services. If you send an e-mail to us, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files and other information you choose to provide to us.  If you purchase a product or service through the Services, our third party payment processors will collect the billing and financial information they need to process your charges. This may include your postal address, email address and financial information. AMC does not directly collect or store your financial information, like credit card numbers. However, AMC’s third party payment processors may share non-financial information with us related to your purchases, like your name, shipping address and items purchased in order to fulfill your order.
From Your Devices:  When you use our Services, we may collect information about the devices you use to access the Services, including hardware model, operating system and version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and other unique device identifiers, mobile network information and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.  We also collect information about how you use our Services, including your access times, browser types and language.  This type of data enables us to understand how often individuals use parts of the Services so we can analyze and improve them.  To collect this information, we use cookies and web beacons, and other similar technologies.  To learn more about how we automatically receive and record information when you interact with the Services, please review our Cookies Policy.  This Privacy Policy covers only how we use information collected via cookies; it does not cover the use of such information by third parties.  However, options you have to control the use of third party cookies are explained in our Cookies Policy.
Location Information: We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information, such as the city, state and/or zip code associated with your IP Address, and, if you agree, more specific location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services. We may use such location information to customize the Services, including advertising that is presented to you. For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in New York, the Services may be customized with New York-specific information, features, and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers.  Options you have to control the automatic collection of location information are explained below under “What Are My Choices.”
Social Media Networks and Other Third Parties:  We may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from third parties and sources, such as our vendors, like web hosting providers, analytics providers or advertisers. You may give us permission to access your information from services offered by third parties, including social media networks.  For example, to access the Services, you may link your Facebook account to the Services, which allows us to obtain information from your Facebook account, such as your friends or contacts, profile picture, birthdate, gender, or other profile-related information and any other information you have opted to share with “everyone” on Facebook (or similar third party platform).  The information we obtain from third party services depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and the third parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences. When you access the Services through social media networks and other third party platforms, you are authorizing AMC to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Policy. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us by a third party may also be subject to that third party’s privacy policy.

Right to request the deletion of personal information we have collected about you. We may retain personal information as permitted by law.
Right to opt out of certain disclosures for valuable consideration. You may exercise this right here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.
California residents may also request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed their “personal information” (as defined under California’s Shine the Light law), if any, for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of “personal information” disclosed to those parties.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising the above-listed rights. We may, however, provide a different level of service or charge a different rate reasonably relating to the value of your personal information.
How to Exercise Your California Rights. If you are a California resident and would like to request access to or deletion of your personal information, please submit your request to privacy@amcnetworks.com. In order to honor your request, we will ask that you provide an email address and contact information which allows us to confirm your identity and avoid fraudulent requests. We verify your identity by matching information you provide with our records. Please note that in the case of requests for deletion, we may need to retain certain personal information to comply with our legal obligations or for other permitted purposes.
You also have the option to designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf. Your authorized agent can submit your request to privacy@amcnetworks.com. For requests through an authorized agent, we require a valid power of attorney or written and signed permission from you. If your authorized agent relies on your written and signed permission, we may need to verify your identity as described above and may contact you directly to confirm that the request is valid.
