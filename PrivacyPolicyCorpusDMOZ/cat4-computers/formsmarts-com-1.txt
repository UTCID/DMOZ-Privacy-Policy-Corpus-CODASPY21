Terms of Service
Service Description
FormSmarts is a hosted software service (a.k.a. software as a service, SaaS) allowing users to create online forms (a.k.a web forms) with our online form maker, embed forms onto their website or access them by their FormSmarts.com URL, and retrieve submitted form data by any technical means documented on this website and supported with their service plan.
We (Syronex LLC) offer the web form service ("FormSmarts") under several service plans; FormSmarts Free, FormSmarts Pro, and FormSmarts Business.
Acceptable Use
FormSmarts may not be used on websites promoting racism, involved in gambling, spamming, web forgery, and more generally illegal activities FormSmarts Free users may not embed forms on the landing page of an online advertising campaign (e.g. Google Adwords). FormSmarts Free may not be used on websites containing adult content. FormSmarts Free users may only publish forms on publicly accessible websites. FormSmarts Pro and Business customers may also publish forms on password protected pages and intranets. We do not allow the use of the FormSmarts Free service on websites collecting sensitive personal information such as detailed identity, financial details, or wealth-related information. This includes, but is not limited to, any websites in the domains of financial services, health, insurance, real estate & property rental, and legal services. We invite anyone concerned to upgrade their account to FormSmarts Pro or FormSmarts Business. Information submitted via web forms is transmitted over standard, non-secure web protocols, and we therefore prohibit the use of FormSmarts to communicate confidential information. FormSmarts Business customers can set up secure forms. Each user, whether a company or individual, may only create one FormSmarts Free account. We reserve the right to suspend web form accounts for which resource usage is deemed by us to high (if you believe this may apply to you, contact FormSmarts Support). FormSmarts Free service may not be resold or provided to a third party, unless explicitly authorized by us.
Embedded Web Forms We allow web publishers to embed forms on their own website or blog. FormSmarts Free users are not permitted to move, alter, remove, or hide the attribution notice "Form by FormSmarts" or the link to our Privacy Policy that appears below their forms. No credit notice is shown on forms attached to FormSmarts Pro and Business accounts. Use of Form URLs Each web form can be accessed by a unique URL on FormSmarts website. The following restrictions apply to the publication of such URLs.
Form URLs may only be published within opt-in bulk emails by verified form owners. Form URLs may not be published within unsolicited and opt-out bulk emails. Form URLs may not be published on internet forums or newsgroups where this could be seen as off-topic or spam. The same restrictions apply to any URLs redirecting to a web form. FormSmarts Free users may not publish form URLs in Adobe Flash content, HTML frame, or popup window.
Account Cancellation
Users may cancel their account by deleting all the web forms in the account. Inactive accounts with no forms associated will be deactivated. Cancellation of a FormSmarts Pro or Business account will discontinue all future billings. Subscription fees are payable in advance and non-refundable. FormSmarts may suspend or terminate an account without notice in case of breach of the terms of use.
Disclaimer
We provide this service (FormSmarts) “as is”, in the hope it will be useful to you, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. We reserve the right to withdraw part or all of the service at anytime, without notice.
We invite you to contact FormSmarts Support for all inquiries regarding FormSmarts terms of service.
