for the service. Members can also order monthly service vs. annual service to minimize the risk. The no-refund
policy is created to prevent service abuses and lower operational cost so that DriveHQ can pass the cost-savings
to its customers. Members can request a service credit if they have un-used credit of more than one month.

CameraFTP member.

DriveHQ shall offer prorated refund to the user. If the membership is over 2 years, there will be no refund.
