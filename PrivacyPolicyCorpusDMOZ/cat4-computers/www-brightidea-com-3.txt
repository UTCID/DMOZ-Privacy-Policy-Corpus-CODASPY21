What device and usage data we process
We use information gathering tools, such as log files, cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information, which may contain Personal Data, from your computer or mobile device as you navigate our websites or interact with emails we have sent you.
Log Files
We gather certain information via log files. This collected information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and data/time stamps associated with your usage. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us provide and improve our websites and to guarantee it security and continued proper functioning. We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into services as part of our security features.
Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies
We use cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from us.
When you visit our websites, our servers or an authorized third-party may place a cookie on your browser, which can collect information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites. Cookies allow us to track overall usage, determine areas that you prefer, make your usage easier by recognizing you and providing you with a customized experience.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our websites or services. To opt-out from tracking from tracking by Google Analytics, please use the specific opt-out mechanism as indicated further below.
We also use web beacons on our websites. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. Such tracking technologies are used to operate and improve our websites and email communications and track the clicking of links or opening of email.
Opt-Out from the collection of device and usage data
You may opt-out from the collection of device and usage data by managing your cookies at the individual browser level. In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click here, or if located in the European Union or the United Kingdom click here. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the websites.
While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard that has been adopted, Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browser’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
If you receive marketing or similar e-mail messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such messages, you may simply follow the opt-out procedure specified in such e-mails. In addition, if you have registered on our site, you may opt-out of receiving any future marketing or similar messages by unsubscribing. You may also contact us at the below addressed:

Please note the opting-out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as information about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements or security information.
Upon a request submitted to data-privacy@brightidea.com, Brightidea will provide website visitors at no cost with access to their personal information that we have on record and the ability to complete, update or remove such information.
