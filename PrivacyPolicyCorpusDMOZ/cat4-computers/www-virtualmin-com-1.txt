Privacy Statement
Virtualmin, Inc. is firmly committed to insuring your privacy.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.
IP and Computer Information
We may use client IP addresses to diagnose problems with our web-site.
Client access information is stored for the purposes of monitoring site usage and performance.
License Key and Subscription
Purchased software requires a license key, and an active software updates subscription on our updates server, in order to function fully.
License keys and subscription IDs are used only for the purpose of verifying license compliance, and notifying customers of upcoming license renewals.
This data will not be sold or disclosed to third parties.
Security of Personal and Financial Data
Any personal information gathered for the purposes of commerce will be transmitted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection with 128-bit encryption, using a certificate provided by COMODO CA Limited. This information will be kept confidential.
Financial and payment details, including credit card numbers, will be collected by our payment processing partners (PayPal or Braintree), and this information will not be received or stored on our servers. We will retain a payment token, provided by our payment process, in order to process recurring payments for your subscription orders at Virtualmin.com.
Email Address
Your email address will be used to email copies of your order information including order number and details.
We do not give away or sell your email address to other companies.
We only use this information to contact you regarding your order and to provide better customer support. In the Virtualmin.com community there are many opportunities to subscribe to email notifications and mailing lists, but you will not be subscribed automatically to any email notifications or mailing lists. You may unsubscribe from our website notifications or mailing lists at any time. You may control all of your subscriptions and notifications on the My Account page under the Notifications tabs.
Name, Address, and Phone Number
Your name, address, and phone number may be stored in our system so that we can better serve you, when you return to our site or file a support issue.
