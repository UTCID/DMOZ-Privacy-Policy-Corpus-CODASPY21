It is our policy to respond to all notices of alleged copyright infringement. If someone believes that one of our customers is infringing their intellectual property rights, they can send a DMCA Notice to Our designated agent for copyright complaints. Please see our DMCA Notice and Takedown Policy for further information.Our Subpoena Policy describe the guidelines and process for our release of data concerning You or Your Account pursuant to a subpoena issued in a civil legal matter or a criminal legal matter or investigation.The most recent version of the Uniform Name Dispute Resolution Policy can be found at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-enPCIOur Services provide a framework that is certified under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) under optimal security settings and will maintain compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards ("DSS") for the portions of the Purchased Services that store or process credit card data. If You store or process credit card data using the Purchased Services, You agree to implement and maintain reasonable security measures to protect cardholder data in Your possession and You hereby acknowledge Your responsibilities under the PCI DSS. These guidelines can be found at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library.

For these purposes, network availability for any month is calculated as a percentage by dividing (x) the total minutes in such month, less the minutes of Network Downtime (as defined below), by (y) the total minutes in such month. "Network Downtime" exists when You are unable to transmit and receive data on the Volusion platform and You notify Us of such downtime. Network Downtime shall exclude performance issues: (1) to the extent caused by factors outside of Our reasonable control; (2) that resulted from any actions or inactions of You or any third parties not affiliated with Us, for example a DDOS attack on Your site or another customer's site hosted on the same server; (3) that resulted from Your equipment and/or third party equipment; (4) that resulted from software related issues; or (5) that are scheduled by Us for purposes of maintaining or updating the Services. Network Downtime is measured from the time the trouble ticket is opened by You to the time the server is once again able to transmit and receive data.If Our network is not available for 99.9% in any month, upon request We will refund You 5% of the monthly fee for each 30 minutes of Network Downtime (up to and not to exceed 100% of customer's monthly fee) that exceeds the amount of Network Downtime that would result in 99.9% network availability. This is Your sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Level Warranty. If You fail to notify Us of Network Downtime as required above, or fail to request a Service Level Warranty credit within 30 days of the end of a month, You shall not be entitled to receive such credit for such event or such month.IndemnificationYou irrevocably agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Us, Our affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees attributable to in house legal personnel, arising from of or related to (i) Your breach of this Agreement or Your violation of any law or rights of any third party, (ii) Your Content and/or Design or (iii)any claim by, on behalf of or against Your End Users, (iv) Your violation of any law or regulation or the rights, including intellectual property rights, of any third party, and (v) any claims of tax authorities of any country, state, province or other jurisdiction levied on sales to Your End Users.
