General aspects
Extend of processing of personal data
We only process personal data, when it is required to serve
our website, our services or other content. Personal data will
only be processed when the user agreed to it. An exception
will be made if a consent could not be given in advance and
the law allows processing in this case.
Deletion of data and storage duration
Personal data will be deleted or access denied, when there is
no reason to store it anymore.
It can still be stored, when
the law requires us to.
Serving Our Websites
Description and Extend of Data Procession
We do not use analytics tools like Google Analytics.
Apache Webserver creates logfiles containing your IP address.
It also logs what files you have requested from us.
We do not store log data together with other personal data of
the user.
Reasons for processing this data
We use the IP address of the user to send websites and
content to the users. Information about it is stored to
avoid abuse of others, find problems and improve our service
in general.
Dissent and removal
We need to write log files to provide our service. There is
no possibility for dissent and we cannot remove your data.
If there is an urgent matter in this case, please send us a
message to privacy@javaspecialists.eu.
Use of cookies
We do not use any cookies on www.javaspecialists.eu.
Subdomains, such as javaspecialists.teachable.com, run on the
Teachable platform and use cookies.
Please see the
privacy
policy for Teachable for the subdomain.
Comments on our website
We are using Disqus to enable our users to leave comments on
our website. Disqus is a service provided in the USA. You can
read the privacy statement of Disqus here: Link.
Comments will only be loaded when the user presses a button.
Unless he gives consent to this, no connection to Disqus will
be enabled.
Newsletter, Slack and Enquiries
Description and extend of data procession
We send newsletters to our users when they subscribed to it
as well as occasional promotional emails about Java education,
such as courses and conferences.
Newsletters are free of charge. We use the service "Infusionsoft".
For subscription we forward to the web pages of Infusionsoft.
You can read the privacy statement of Infusionsoft here: Link.
To send you newsletters, we will ask for your e-mail address,
your first name and your Java skill level.
We also ask for
your last name and your country, but the response is not
mandatory to receive the newsletters.
Links in newsletters are redirected to Infusionsoft, which
may set tags to track interest.
The tags may also be used
to start campaign sequences.
For enquiry forms regarding our courses or consulting or
general enquiries, we request your phone number and company
in order to be able to evaluate your request and to respond
in a quick and efficient manner.
We also log your IP address
together with your enquiry to confirm the country you are
enquiring from.
An example of such an enquiry form can be
seen here.
We offer a free Slack channel for Java enthusiasts.
To
register we need to ask your first and last name, as well as
email address.
This information is sent to Slack to
register you.
Please read the Slack privacy policy here:
Slack Privacy Policy.
Reasons for processing
Your data will be used to send newsletters to you as well
as relevant commercial offers by the publishers of the
newsletter.
Dissent and removal
The subscription can be cancelled at any time. Every newsletter
contains a link at the bottom that can be used for that.
