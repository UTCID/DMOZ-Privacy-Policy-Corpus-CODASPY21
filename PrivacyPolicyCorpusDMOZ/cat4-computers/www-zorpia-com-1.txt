If you post and/or disclose to other Members any confidential or sensitive information, such as personal information (surname, postal address, email, telephone number…) or financial information (e.g., credit card or bank account information), then you do so entirely at your own risk.

THEREFORE TWOO EXCLUDES ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH EVENTS OF ANY NATURE WHICH COULD TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MEMBERS DURING ONLINE INTERACTIONS, WHETHER ON OR OFF THE SERVICE, OR IF YOU MEET IN PERSON.
7. Purchases
7.1 Generally
From time to time, Twoo may offer products and services for purchase ('In-App Purchases') through iTunes, Google Play, carrier billing, Twoo direct billing or other payment platforms authorised by Twoo. If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the applicable payment provider, and your method of payment (be it your card or a third-party account such as Google Play or iTunes) (your 'Payment Method') will be charged for the In-App Purchase at the prices displayed to you for the service(s) you've selected, as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and you authorise Twoo or the third-party account, as applicable, to charge you.
7.2 Packages
Packages are automatically renewed, until you terminate or cancel the subscription. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically be renewed for an additional equivalent period or any other period if so displayed on the Service at time of purchase, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. Your card payment information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic card payments in accordance with the Agreement.
You may unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time by going to your Settings on Twoo or the relevant third-party account, but please be advised that you are still obligated to pay any outstanding amounts.
If you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log into your Twoo account or your third-party account and follow instructions to terminate or cancel your subscription, even if you have deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Twoo application from your device. Twoo will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or cancel your subscription on Twoo or the third-party account, as applicable. If you terminate or cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT ON TWOO OR DELETING THE TWOO APPLICATION FROM YOUR DEVICE DOES NOT TERMINATE OR CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.
7.3 Credits
Each Member has the option to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable license to use Credits (hereinafter 'Credits'). You are only allowed to purchase Credits from us through the Service and not in any other way.
Twoo, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Credits and/or may distribute Credits with or without charge. The right to use Credits starts immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase by Twoo until termination of your account by either party, or when Twoo ceases providing the Service. Credits expire 91 days after the date of purchase.
Any Credits balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, and may only be redeemed through the Service. The transfer of Credits is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Credits to any person or entity.
All purchases and redemptions of Credits made through the Service are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. You acknowledge that Twoo is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Credits when an account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary. However, if Twoo ceases providing the Service, Credits and/or changes its business model, you will be entitled to a refund on a prorated basis.
8. Terms of Payment and Refunds
8.1. Fees and Terms of Payment of Paid Services
The fees and the terms of payment are described on the Service. Members may pay either by bank card (on the Internet or through a mobile service) or by using an online payment service (PayPal, Direct Debit, etc.) according to the options given on the relevant platform. The fees are inclusive of all taxes.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information, terminate or cancel your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.
8.2. Refunds
Generally, all charges for purchases are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.
For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with local law and except if the purchased service is performed immediately upon your request, you are entitled to a full refund of your Package without stating the reason during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts. Refunds will be made using the same means of payment as used by you in the initial transaction. In any case, no fees will be charged to you as a result of the refund.
To request a refund:

This Agreement does not grant Members any rights, implied or otherwise, to the content disseminated on the Service. All trademarks, logos, graphics, software, photographs, animations, videos, text appearing on the Service are the exclusive intellectual property of Twoo and its licensors as may be applicable, and may not be reproduced, used, published, distributed, sold or displayed without the express prior written permission of Twoo or its licensors, subject to legal action.
The rights of use granted to the Member are limited to private and personal use as part of and for the duration of the membership on the Service. Any other use by the Member is prohibited. The Member is prohibited from, among other actions, modifying, copying, creating a derivative work, disassembling or otherwise attempt to extract the source code composing the Service, downloading, broadcasting, transmitting, commercially exploiting and/or distributing the Service or computer codes of the elements composing the Service, in any way whatsoever, subject to legal action.

These rights are granted for the duration of the Agreement between you and Twoo and are subject to your rights under applicable law.
14. Disputes – Governing Law
14.1Except for users residing within the EU or European Economic Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law:
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures except as modified by our Arbitration Procedures (see below). The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small-claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in the small-claims court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Twoo (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Twoo (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
14.2For Members residing in the EU or European Economic Area or other countries where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Belgium, subject to mandatory laws and regulations in force in the country of residence of the Member. The courts of Brussels, Belgium will have jurisdiction, if not otherwise required by the applicable consumer protection legislation in the country of residence of the Member.
14.3If you reside in the EU or European Economic Area, you may also submit your complaint on the platform of online dispute resolution hosted by the European Commission at: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. The European Commission will transfer the Member’s complaint to the competent national mediators. In accordance with the rules applicable to mediation, prior to any request for mediation, the Member must first raise any dispute with Twoo in writing in order to attempt an amicable resolution. In the event that an amicable solution cannot be reached, the competent authorities will be the courts of the country of residence of the consumer located in one of the member States of the EU or European Economic Area.
15. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information:
an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service (and such description must be reasonably sufficient to enable us to find the alleged infringing material);
your contact information, including address, telephone number and e-mail address;
a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

16. Personal Data
Your personal data is processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We strongly recommend that you read our Privacy Policy to understand how we process your personal data, what your rights are and how to exercise them.
17. Changes to Twoo and to the Terms & Conditions
We may update the content and/or features of the Service at any moment in order to improve the quality of the Service. We may also modify the Terms & Conditions at any moment. The most recent version will be posted on the Service, and you should regularly check for the most recent version.
Modified versions will take effect thirty (30) days after being published on the Service, and your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective shall indicate your acceptance of the new version.
If changes to the Terms & Conditions negatively affect your rights and obligations or affect a service for which you performed a payment, you will be informed of the nature of these updates or modifications by reasonable means, through notification or e-mail, when they are implemented on the Service. In such case, you have the right to cancel this service and receive a pro rata refund, provided you notify us within the aforementioned period of thirty (30) days.
18. Translation
This Agreement is drafted in the English language. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, if this Agreement is translated into any language other than English, the English version shall control and prevail in case of any discrepancies or ambiguities due to translation.
Arbitration Procedures
1. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the 'Arbitration Procedures') are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and Twoo. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the 'JAMS Rules'), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the JAMS Rules.
2. Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against Twoo, you must complete a short form, submit it to JAMS, and send a copy to Twoo at Match Group, Inc., PO Box 25458, Dallas, TX 75225. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute arbitration, please visit the JAMS website and download the form available at: https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf.
3. Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the JAMS’s fee schedule for consumer disputes. Twoo will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against Twoo is for less than $1,000, we will pay all fees. If you believe you cannot afford JAMS’s fee, you may apply to JAMS for a fee waiver.
4. Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution.
