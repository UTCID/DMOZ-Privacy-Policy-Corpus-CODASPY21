VOIP Privacy and Security
VOIP will continue to gain acceptance, particularly for companies working within a globally distributed environment. Those working inside the firewall want to keep the rest of the world on the outside. Unfortunately, network threats will always exist. It stands to reason that privacy and security will always be major concerns.
A recent Gartner survey revealed that security does not rank as high as some of the other VOIP deployment issues – probably because network security is a very manageable task. Network integrators offer sage advice for keeping your VOIP network private and secure.
Security - Start with the Basics
Security – Use Logon Prompts and PINs
Keep Voice and Data Separate
Security – Make VOIP Network High Priority
Security – Encrypt Transmissions to Remote Users
