This Web site is an online information and communication service provided by D2 Emerge LLC. Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using this site. By using this site, you signify your agreement with these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any of the below Terms of Use, do not use this site.

Information Gathering
Our Web servers automatically recognize and collect the domain name and IP address of visitors to our Web sites. In addition, we collect aggregate information on which Web pages visitors access or visit. We collect addresses and demographic information about subscribers to our newsletters and publications, people who voluntarily register for our Web sites and who attend our events. The information we collect is used to improve the quality of our products and services, and to contact visitors about products and services as explained below.
Your Information
Opt-in mail addresses of D2 Emerge subscribers are used for re-qualification purposes. From time to time, opt-in e-mail addresses, mailing addresses and telephone numbers provided by Web site visitors, subscribers to our newsletters and publications, and attendees at our events, may also be used to collect feedback by members of our editorial or research team or for promotional purposes by D2 Emerge.
From time to time, you may receive an e-mail, direct mail or phone call about special software development-related offers from D2 Emerge or our affiliates on behalf of reputable third parties. With each e-mail use of the subscriber’s address the subscriber can “opt-out” of receiving further e-mail from outside firms and/or D2 Emerge.
Your subscriber information will be held for three years from the date of last interaction. After that period of time we will delete your information if you reside in the EU.
If the opt-in e-mail subscriber does not choose to “opt-out” from third-party messages, or does not respond to the questions concerning how we may use their e-mail address, the address may be used by D2 Emerge to send messages on behalf of carefully chosen outside firms. Subscribers may change their e-mail preferences at any time by sending a message to privacy@d2emerge.com indicating such.
Similarly, subscribers who do not wish to be contacted by other third-party organizations by mail or telephone may do so by contacting privacy@d2emerge.com.
