FormSmarts offers both free and paid accounts. “Member” and “registered user” mean anyone who creates a FormSmarts account. “Customer” and “client” mean anyone who purchases a paid subscription or signs up for a free trial for a paid subscription. “Web site visitor” and “visitor” mean anyone accessing our website https://FormSmarts.com. 2. Data Collection 2.1 Data collected on behalf of a third party As a service provider, FormSmarts stores and processes data submitted via online forms on behalf of our clients (including free trial customers). The information collected via web forms is intended to be handed over to our customers for their sole use, on which FormSmarts doesn't have any controls. Part of FormSmarts service involves abuse prevention, and we may therefore retain part or all of the data submitted in case of suspected abuse. In such a case, data may be held by us for analysis or review.
When supported by their service plan, customers may choose to collect and store form responses on FormSmarts for easier access and processing. In such a case, our client remains the sole recipient of the data. FormSmarts only acts as a technical service provider. As of March 17, 2017, data storage is enabled by default for all Business accounts.
With the exception of the fraud prevention case outlined in the first paragraph of this section, FormSmarts staff does not access collected data. We only disclose data to law enforcement organization when legally obliged to do so. 2.1.1 Email communications This section outlines the types of email communications third parties may receive from FormSmarts and in which circumstances we may send such emails.

As part of processing form responses, FormSmarts may send a confirmation email to the email address provided on a form.
We also occasionally send a validation email for fraud prevention purposes.
In both cases, FormSmarts only uses the email address when the form is being submitted and does not re-use it.
We may send notification emails to third parties whose email address is associated with a FormSmarts account as outlined in Section 2.5.3. Besides our verification email asking for permission to add the email address to a FormSmarts account and form responses, such individuals may exceptionally receive an account management notice (account suspension or reactivation notice) regarding the account their email is associated with. 2.2 Data collected from all visitors 2.2.1 Data collected when browsing the website
