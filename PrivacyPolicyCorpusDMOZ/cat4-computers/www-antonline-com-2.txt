Important Information About These Terms and Conditions of Sale
These terms and conditions of sale constitute a binding contract between
Customer and Atlanta Network Technologies. Customer accepts these terms
and conditions of sale by making a purchase, placing an order or otherwise
shopping on Atlanta Network Technologies' Website (the "Site"). These
terms and conditions of sale are subject to change without prior notice,

in question.
These terms and conditions of sale constitute the entire agreement between
Customer and Atlanta Network Technologies relating to the terms and
conditions of sale of products and services on the Site. All sales are
retail and not for resale. Customer consents to receiving electronic

connected to the Internet; individual consumers may withdraw consent to
receiving electronic records or have the record provided in non-electronic
form by contacting Atlanta Network Technologies at the address provided
below.
Customer may issue a purchase order for administrative purposes only.
Additional or different terms and conditions contained in any such
purchase order will be null and void. Customer agrees that the terms and
conditions of sale contained herein and in Atlanta Network Technologies's

between the parties and no usage of trade will be relevant to determine
the meaning of these terms and conditions of sale or any purchase order or
invoice related thereto.

outside the United States.
Warranties
Customer understands that Atlanta Network Technologies is not the
manufacturer of the products purchased by Customer hereunder and the only
warranties offered are those of the manufacturer, not Atlanta Network
Technologies. In purchasing the products, Customer is relying on the
manufacturer's specifications only and is not relying on any statements,
specifications in brochures, photographs or other illustrations
representing the products that may be provided by Atlanta Network
Technologies. In connection with services, neither affiliates of Atlanta
Network Technologies nor third party service providers are agents of
Atlanta Network Technologies and Atlanta Network Technologies has no
obligation or liability arising from any services performed by or any
warranty, if any, made by, such service providers. Atlanta Network
Technologies AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATED TO PRODUCTS SOLD OR SERVICES PROVIDED
BY THIRD PARTIES OR AFFILIATES OF Atlanta Network Technologies, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT THE TERMS OF THE
MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY, IF ANY.
Pricing Information; Availability Disclaimer
All pricing is subject to change. Atlanta Network Technologies reserves
the right to make adjustments to pricing, products and service offerings
for reasons including, but not limited to, changing market conditions,
product discontinuation, product unavailability, manufacturer price
changes and errors in advertisements. All orders are subject to product
availability. Therefore, Atlanta Network Technologies cannot guarantee
that it will be able to fulfill Customer's orders.
Limitation of Liability
NEITHER Atlanta Network Technologies NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES,
OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. NEITHER Atlanta Network Technologies
NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR PRODUCTS NOT BEING AVAILABLE FOR USE
OR FOR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR SOFTWARE OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES BY
THIRD PARTIES. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT FOR ANY LIABILITY RELATED TO THE
PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED DIRECTLY BY Atlanta Network
Technologies OR ITS AFFILIATES, NEITHER Atlanta Network Technologies NOR
ITS AFFILIATES ARE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AMOUNT OF DAMAGES ABOVE

RISE TO THE CLAIM.

delivery which result from any circumstances beyond its control, including
without limitation, product unavailability, carrier delays, delays due to
fire, severe weather conditions, failure of power, labor problems, acts of
war, terrorism, general insurrection, acts of God or acts of any
government or agency.
Third Party Services
Customer acknowledges and agrees that, in some instances, Atlanta Network
Technologies, Atlanta Network Technologies Technology Services, Inc., and
their affiliates are resellers of services and are not the provider of
those services. In those cases, the third party service provider is the
only party responsible for providing services to Customer. In those cases,
Customer will look solely to the third party service provider for any
loss, claims or damages arising from or relating to the purchase or
provision of such services. Customer hereby releases Atlanta Network
Technologies, Atlanta Network Technologies Technology Services, Inc. and
their affiliates from any and all claims arising from or relating to the
purchase or provision of any such services by third party service
providers. Services may be subject to tax. All amounts, including taxes,
associated with third party services are being collected by Atlanta
Network Technologies on behalf of Atlanta Network Technologies Technology
Services, Inc. solely in the capacity as an independent sales agent.
Arbitration
Any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, whether preexisting, present or future, and including
statutory, common law, intentional tort and equitable claims) arising from
or relating to the products or services sold pursuant to these terms and
conditions of sale, the interpretation or application of these terms and
conditions of sale or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the
relationships which result from these terms and conditions of sale
(including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, relationships
with third parties who are not signatories hereto), or Atlanta Network
Technologies's advertising and marketing (collectively, a "Claim") WILL BE
RESOLVED, UPON THE ELECTION OF Atlanta Network Technologies, CUSTOMER OR
THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED, EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. If
arbitration is chosen, it will be conducted pursuant to the Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, with offices in Atlanta, GEORGIA. If
arbitration is chosen by any party with respect to a Claim, neither
Atlanta Network Technologies nor Customer will have the right to litigate
that Claim in court or to have a jury trial on that Claim or to engage in
pre-arbitration discovery, except as provided for in the applicable
arbitration rules or by agreement of the parties. Further, Customer will
not have the right to participate as a representative or member of any
class of claimants pertaining to any Claim. Notwithstanding any choice of
law provision included in these terms and conditions of sale, this
arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act
(9 U.S.C. 1-16). The arbitration will take place in Atlanta, GEORGIA. Any
court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrator(s). Each party will bear its own cost of any legal
representation, discovery or research required to complete arbitration.
The existence or results of any arbitration will be treated as
confidential. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
all matters pertaining to the collection of amounts due to Atlanta Network
Technologies arising out of sales hereunder will be exclusively litigated
in court rather than through arbitration.
Orders; Payment Terms; Interest; Taxes
Orders are not binding upon Atlanta Network Technologies unless accepted
(credit card transactions processed on the site DO NOT constitute
acceptance of an order.) by Atlanta Network Technologies and we reserve
the right to cancel any order for any reason. Terms of payment are within
Atlanta Network Technologies' sole discretion. Invoices are due and
payable within the time period specified on the invoice, measured from the
date of invoice. Atlanta Network Technologies may invoice parts of an
order separately. Customer agrees to pay interest on all past-due sums at
the lower of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month or at the highest
rate allowed by law. Customer is responsible for, and will indemnify and
hold Atlanta Network Technologies harmless from, any applicable sales, use
or other taxes associated with the order. Customer must claim any
exemption from tax at the time of purchase and provide the necessary
supporting documentation. Any sales, use or other applicable tax is based
on the location to which the order is shipped. In the event of a payment
default, Customer will be responsible for all of Atlanta Network
Technologies' costs of collection, including court costs, filing fees and
attorney's fees. All payments by Paypal or wire transfer must be completed
within 24 hours of sale. If an order is not paid within the 24 hour window
the order will become null and void.
Price Comparisons, "Original Price" and "Your Savings".
Price comparisons may be made throughout the site to indicate the relative
savings amounts of our pricing.
"Original Price"
is the suggested retail price provided to us by our suppliers. We make no
representation that a substantial number of these products have been sold
or offered for sale at the original price. Actual retail prices in your
area may be substantially different. Because we sell our merchandise over
the internet on a national basis, it is not possible to know if our
merchandise is sold at the original price in any particular location or at
any particular time.
"YOUR SAVINGS"
reflects the difference between our price and the supplier provided
original price shown on our sites. Because the original price may be
different than the actual retail prices in your area, you may not actually
realize a savings of this amount and may want to make an exact comparison
for yourself by checking the prices of other internet or local retailers
prior to making a purchase.
Consent to Collection, Use & Disclosure of Your Personal Information.
As more fully described in our Privacy Policy, you must disclose certain
Personally Identifiable Information to use our Site, register, and make
purchases. As a condition of registering with our Site or making any
purchases of any products and/or services or conduct any transactions, you
represent that you have first read our Privacy Policy and consent to the
collection, use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information
and Non-Personally Identifiable Information as described in our Privacy
Policy. Our Privacy Policy's terms and conditions will change from time to
time, and as a condition of browsing the Site, using any features or
making any purchase, you agree that you will first review our Privacy
Policy prior to making initial or subsequent purchases. We reserve the
right to change our Privacy Policys terms and conditions from time to
time without notifying you of these changes.
While ANTONLINE.COM takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent
unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, we cannot
be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and we
make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent

ANTONLINE.COM OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER
COMPENSATORY, CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
SPECIAL OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A
THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT OR
OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANTONLINE.COM
WAS GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE.

etc.)

or check any applicable warranty you might have for other potential return
opportunities. Note that we have no control over the policies of the manufacturer

return policies.

conformance with the basic criteria and basic returns policy listed above,
the purchase price will be credited back to the purchaser for the original
purchase in accordance with the payment method used for purchase. Please
