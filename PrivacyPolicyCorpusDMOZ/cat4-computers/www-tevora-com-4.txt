Privacy Impact Assessment
At Tevora, we equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to understand how privacy affects your organization.
Our team of consultants at Tevora will conduct detailed technical interviews to assess the ways privacy affects your organization. We perform interviews across all departments to gain a comprehensive and holistic knowledge of the unique ways that data is utilized in your daily operations. We consider this insight within the context of regulatory and general day-to-day privacy concerns and then provide you with our Privacy Impact Assessment and recommendations.
Our privacy impact assessment can assist your organization in:
Understanding how data is used on a daily basis
Privacy concerns that arise from daily use
Privacy concerns that arise from meeting regulations
Any security vulnerabilities and risks your organization faces
