Testimonials
Tracey P.
Business Manager
"It is extremely easy to enter time. We have been using BQE CORE for close to a year and the best thing our staff likes
is that it is very user friendly."
Laura D.
Business Manager
"We switched to CORE to make sure all our employees have a one centralized software for time and expense tracking.
Our staff is enjoying as it works really well."
Laura S.
Principal
"A little over one year back as we started up our new business I was researching for the best accounting, time and
expense tracking and billing software. I selected BQE CORE because it had an intuitive interface, easy reporting and
it was on cloud."
Kimberly P.
Business Manager
"It provides us with a single source to record employee time. With the mobile app, our partners access CORE data anytime,
anywhere, and can record travel expenses directly from their smartphones."
