Privacy Statement
At TECHSOFT, we understand the concerns of users visiting www.TECHSOFT.com (“Site”). TECHSOFT respects your privacy and treats the information you provide us, including your Personal Information, with care. This Privacy Statement applies to our Site. It explains how we collect, use, and disclose information collected from you and the rights and choices available to you. View our Site’s Terms and Conditions.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected from you offline, to TECHSOFT websites not linked to this Privacy Statement or to third party websites linked to our Site. Your use of TECHSOFT’s websites which do link to this Privacy Statement is subject to this Privacy Statement and its related Terms of Use. Your use of third party websites is governed by their respective privacy policy.
Personal and Other Information
Through your interaction and use of our Site, TECHSOFT may collect “Personal Information”, which is information that identifies or relates to an individual. As examples, Personal Information may include your name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, company affiliation, and associated interests.
TECHSOFT may also collect “Other Information” through your interaction with and use of the Site, which is not directly related to an individual. As examples, Other Information may include browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, and statistical or aggregated data.
Statistical or aggregated data does not directly identify a specify person, but it may be derived from Personal Information. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.
In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. In such cases, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
Information You Provide to Us
If you request or provide Personal Information through our Site using our online contact forms, we store the Personal Information you provide to assist us in responding to your requests. If you apply for a job at TECHSOFT, the Personal information we receive from you is used for employment consideration and other human resource purposes, such as communicating with you in writing, by telephone, or online; evaluating your application; analyzing our staffing needs and practices; or supporting other actions related to our hiring process and employee administration. We may combine your data with research tools and information from other sources. Unless you request otherwise, we may keep your Personal Information for future consideration. If you provide Personal Information through links to third party websites, you may be asked to provide additional information by these websites.
Information We Collect by Automated Tools
When you access our Site, we may collect Other Information by automated means, including the use of cookies, web server logs, and third party analytics. Cookies are small pieces of data or data files that are sent by a website to your web browser and stored on your computer. They are used to understand general traffic patterns on our Site. The Other Information stored in the cookie is used for statistical tracking and other purposes, but not for individual identification. Cookies are also used to prefill forms so that you do not need to re-enter the data, such as when you apply for a job online. Accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or any Personal Information about you. We may use the aggregated data to provide feedback to our web designers, content providers, or business managers to assist them in improving our Site and services offered. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.
If you select this setting, however, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Site. Additionally, our web servers may log Other Information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We may also record Other Information such as the address of the webpage that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to our Site. Additionally, we may log Other Information about your interaction with our Site, such as pages you visit. Because we do not track our Site’s users over time and across third-party websites, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals at this time. We may also use third party web analytics to help us analyze how users engage with our Site. The Other Information collected will be disclosed to, or collected by, these third party service providers.
