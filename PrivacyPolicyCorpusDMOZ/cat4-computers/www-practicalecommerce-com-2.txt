Editorial Policy
Our editorial mission is to help ecommerce merchants grow and prosper. We do this with easy-to-follow articles, columns, seminars, and podcasts by seasoned, talented contributors — all delivered electronically. We value editorial integrity and are members of Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing.
Editorial Calendar
Our content is mostly planned around one-time feature stories and recurring departments that address a topic. The mix of our content periodically changes based on the needs of our merchant audience. We closely manage our content, but we do not publish an editorial calendar.
Become an Expert Source
If you possess expertise helpful to ecommerce merchants, we encourage you to enter your contact and biographical information into our editorial database. Our staff uses this for researching stories, including background help and public on-the-record quotations. Become an expert source. >
Submission Guidelines
We are always interested in quality contributors who can genuinely help ecommerce merchants. If you have a suitable topic or idea, we encourage you to contact us. We do not publish one-time pieces or unsolicited pieces. Instead, we assign broad topics to qualified contributors, who then address those topics at least monthly.
We work directly with our contributors, not intermediaries.
We do not publish press releases.
We do not publish one-time articles, unsolicited or otherwise.
Our audience is mainly small to midsize ecommerce merchants.
We avoid promotional pieces.
Product Releases
If your company is launching a new ecommerce product or service, or an upgrade to an existing product or service, you may send the press release to releases@practicalecommerce.com for consideration in our occasional article of new products and services.
Vendor Directory
Listings in our vendor directory are free for companies that offer products and services to ecommerce merchants. If you’re looking to expose your offerings to our audience, start with our vendor directory. >
Logos
You may download our logos and use them for legitimate purposes, provided you don’t alter them or change their colors. To download, please visit our Logos and brand guide. >
