InfinityQS offers Quality Intelligence and quality control solutions that help manufacturers reduce scrap, comply with regulations and standards, and meet customer requirements. Developed by industrial statisticians using proven methodologies for quality analysis and control, InfinityQS solutions are saving leading manufacturers millions of dollars each year.
Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an industry-standard methodology for measuring and controlling quality during the manufacturing process. InfinityQS software automates SPC, eliminating human error and the need for paper records. SPC identifies when processes are out of control due to assignable cause variation (variation caused by special circumstancesnot inherent to the process).
InfinityQS provides the industrys leading real-time SPC software solutions, automating quality data collection and analysis. Using proven SPC techniques for quality control, InfinityQS helps you make intelligent decisions to improve your manufacturing processes in real time, before defects occur.
