Who is responsible for your personal information? ESCMID, P.O. Box 214, 4010 Basel, Switzerland, is responsible for your personal information provided to us or collected by us during the course of our business. As of 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets new definitions for how to handle personal data.

In order to provide you with our services for registered users and members, ESCMID collects and stores personal data from its registered users and members. We only collect information that is required for the specific purposes ESCMID offers, store it in secured databases and make sure to delete outdated user data ultimately. The types of personal information we may collect for this purpose include your name, contact details (such as your address, e-mail address, telephone and mobile numbers), your date of birth, the name of the organisation you work for, the contact details of your organisation, your curriculum vitae, references, and other information with which you provide us to participate, attend, speak, chair, sponsor, endorse or otherwise support the Events, as well as information of all kind from correspondence, contacts, and interactions with us relating to the Events.
We will also process information of all kind that is revealed to us in the course of the Events organized, developed and executed by us, which may include questions you ask or comments or other content and material you post or upload during video presentations, discussions or virtual and Q&A sessions and your participation in the Events. If you are not sure whether your interaction with us falls under one of the items mentioned before or you have interacted with us in another way, and you would like to know whether we have collected any personal information about you in this regard, feel free to contact us at info[at]escmid.org to know more. We collect personal information directly from you, related organisations, or other persons and their respective representatives or employees. We may receive or collect personal information from third persons such as your employer, other organisations that you have dealings with, or regulators or government agencies. We may also collect personal information from publicly available sources. We may use this information to provide all services in connection with the organization, development and execution of the Events, to fulfil our mission, to conduct, monitor, or analyse our business (e.g. administrative or operational processes), to improve our services in connection with present and future Events, and more generally to offer additional educational services.2.2 Business development and business acceptance We collect personal information about attendees, participants, speakers, chairpersons as well as other business contacts of the sponsors or endorsers of the Events as part of the development of other initiatives, conferences, or our mission.

You can control the information you receive through our marketing communications by using the corresponding option at the bottom of our e-mails.

2.4 	Registration for our newsletter and information on the Events We collect, store and process certain personal information such as your name and e-mail address when you register for our newsletter or sign up to receive further information on the Events. 2.5 	Other contacts Further, we collect and process information about you if you offer or provide products or services to us, if we evaluate your products or services, and generally when you request information from us or provide information to us.
3. 	Our basis for processing your personal information We will only use your personal information if and to the extent that applicable law allows us to do so. We will therefore process your personal information only if: it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or the organisation you work for; it is necessary in connection with a legal obligation; you have given your consent (where necessary) to such use or the organisation you work for has obtained your consent (where necessary) to share your information with us; or we or a third party have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information which is not overridden by your interests or your rights and freedoms. When we rely on such a legitimate interest and you would like to know more about how we balanced our and your interests, you can contact us at info[at]escmid.org. 4. 	How and why we may share your personal information For some of our services related to the ESCMID membership, awards, research funding and so forth we work with trusted third parties. Your data is processed by these partners exclusively for the purpose of providing the aforementioned services and won’t be shared with any other party. In accordance with the GDPR, we conclude contracts to order data processing with each of our partners. All of our partners are located within the EU and are bound to the GDPR and ESCMID’s security requirements. We may share your personal information collected in the course of the Events with third persons (such as affiliates, sponsors, IT providers, vendors, service providers and other persons or organisations) in Switzerland, the EU or other countries if required or useful for providing our products and services. Further, we may share your personal information with third persons where: you have consented to us doing so (where necessary) or the organisation that you work for has obtained your consent for us to do so (where necessary); we are under a legal, regulatory or professional obligation to do so (for example, to comply with anti-money laundering or sanctions requirements); or it is necessary in connection with legal proceedings or in order to exercise or defend legal rights. We use third parties who provide products and services on our behalf and may share your information with them. These third parties include banks, insurance companies or technology suppliers. They may have access to your personal information when providing support.
5. 	How we protect your personal information We have put in place appropriate security measures to hold your personal information securely in electronic and physical form, to protect it from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss. The participation in the Events is access controlled by your personal login and password authentication. Our employees and third party service providers who have access to confidential information (including personal information) are subject to confidentiality obligations.
6. 	How long we keep your personal data We will retain your personal information at least for as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. We will further retain your personal information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, for as long as claims could be brought against us and for as long as legitimate interests, including data security, require us to do so.
7. 	Your rights The GDPR gives our members the right to ask for information regarding the personal data we store from them. Please feel free to contact our data security officers at info[at]escmid.org to review all your data we store from you as a member. You can quit your membership at any time. All your personal data we’ve stored to that point will then get deleted ultimately.In relation to the processing of your personal information you have rights that you can exercise under certain circumstances. These rights are to: request access to your personal information and certain information in relation to their processing; request rectification of your personal information; request the erasure of your personal information; request that we restrict the processing of your personal information; and object to the processing of your personal information.  If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing or transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to. We may refuse to provide access if the relevant data protection legislation or other legislation allows or obliges us to do so, in which case we will provide reasons for our decision as required by the law. If you would like to exercise these rights, please contact us in writing by e-mail at info[at]escmid.org or by letter to: ESCMID Executive OfficeP.O.
