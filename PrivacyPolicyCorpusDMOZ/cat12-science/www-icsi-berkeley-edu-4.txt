Previous Work: Privacy Literacy with San Jose Public Library
Principal Investigator(s): Julia BerndICSI researchers are collaborating with the San Jose Public Library and San Jose State University's Game Development club to develop an online tool which will help individuals understand privacy in the digital age and make informed decisions about their online activity. Beyond the standard educational aid, this tool will be non-biased, acknowledging that people have many different definitions of privacy and may have different needs based on what kind of online persona they have created. The goal is to create a fun and engaging way for people to learn about privacy and obtain a guide with resources that are tailored to their specific needs.
