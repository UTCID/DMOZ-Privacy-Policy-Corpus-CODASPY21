Our practices are reviewed periodically for compliance with federal and state laws and University of California policy.

Cookies
Some of our sites may employ cookies. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is either maintained only for the duration of a particular session visit (called a session cookie) or is stored on your computer to uniquely identify your browser to support future visits (a persistent cookie). A session cookie terminates when the visitor closes the browser, the data is not stored. UCSB sites that use persistent cookies store the information collected during the visit to make subsequent visits more efficient for the visitor. Cookies provide usage statistics about our Web sites; as we understand how our sites are used we can facilitate navigation in our UCSB Web space and enhance the visitor's experience. Cookies may also be used for authentication processes (site security purposes). You may remove UCSB persistent cookies from your computer at any time by following your internet browser directions. If you prefer not to receive a cookie, you may set your browser to refuse it or set it to ask you whether you want to accept a particular cookie. However, some pages may not function properly if the cookies are turned off.
Visitor Communications
If you make an inquiry via our Web sites, those communications will be used to respond to you and to improve services. Unless you request otherwise, your inquiry may be forwarded to another UCSB addressee who may be more appropriate to respond. We recommend that you do not include in your inquiry social security numbers, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information. Email is not a secure medium.
Information You Voluntarily Provide
On some of our Web sites, you may choose to provide information to us to obtain services or information. For example, you may sign up for a mailing list or send us your address so we may send you an application or other material. We will use your information to respond to your request and may also use it to keep you informed of other campus activities, programs, or for future communications. You may opt out of these additional types of communications at any time by following the Web site's unsubscribe instructions or by directing your request to the contact for the Web site on which you provided the original information.
Other types of personally identifiable information that you may provide to us on our Web sites can include: name, address, telephone numbers, birthday, student identification number, social security number, credit card number, user name, password, and/or net-id. This information will be used to respond to you or to provide you with a requested service, such as enrollment, purchases, making a donation, and other educational, research, service programs or administrative purposes. In some cases, the information requested is mandatory in order for us to provide you with the information or service you seek. These fields will be marked with an "*". If you do not wish to provide the mandatory information, you may contact the specific Web site's contact person and ask whether there is an alternate method for you to provide the required information to obtain the service. Article IX, Section 9 of the California Constitution grants authority to the University of California to maintain this information.
Please be aware that we will never use an email note to ask you to provide confidential or restricted information. If you receive such an email request, it is not from UCSB regardless of the purported sender's identification. We recommend that you do not respond to that email. We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent, unless required by law or legal instruments. We retain the information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with laws and retention requirements.
Information Children May Voluntarily Provide
If a UCSB site collects information from children (an individual under the age of 13), information will be collected, maintained, and secured in compliance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. If you are a parent or guardian, you can help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on UCSB Web sites without your permission.
Third Party Sites
UCSB Web sites may contain links to non-University sites (Third Party Sites). UCSB is not responsible for nor does it control the content, use, or retention of information found on linked Third Party Sites. Third party sites may collect or solicit data from you or place their cookies or other files on your computer. Checking the privacy statement of a Third Party Site is recommended. UCSB does not endorse the services or products found on Third Party Sites.
