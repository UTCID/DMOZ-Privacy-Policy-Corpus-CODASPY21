Cookies
What are cookies?
When web sites provide services, they want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:
Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.
Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested.
Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
GEBCO's web site only uses cookies as described in category 3. Find out more about cookies from AboutCookies.org.
Our use of cookies
Our cookies cannot be used to collect personally identifiable information about you. Please be aware that restricting cookies may ultimately impact on the services we provide.
