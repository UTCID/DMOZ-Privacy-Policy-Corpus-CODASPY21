Hereunder you will find the information on how Asper Biogene LLC (hence: Asper Biogene) processes and protects your personal data:
1. Collecting of personal data, defining data controller and data processor
Asper Biogene is a world-renown genetic testing company that provides various genetic testing services (hereinafter: the Services) and is engaged in the development of such tests. In order to provide you the Services, Asper Biogene must process your personal data, including your health and biometric data.
The data collected and processed by Asper Biogene may include your name, personal identification number or date of birth, nationality, phone number, e-mail address, home address, bank account details and other data needed for the provision of Services, but also the data pertaining to your health and genes (hereinafter: the Data). Asper Biogene collects and receives the Data from you when you place the order for Services. In relation to the Data received from you, Asper Biogene is the data controller within the meaning of data protection legislation.
In case the Services are ordered by medical institution or some distributor, then your Data is collected and passed to Asper Biogene by your doctor, other healthcare specialist or employee of such distributor. In this case Asper Biogene is regarded as the data processor and such medical institution or distributor as the data controller within the meaning of data protection legislation.
In case you belong to an organization of Asper Biogene’s partner (medical institution or distributor of Services, etc), then Asper Biogene wishes to process your Data (mainly your name, e-mail address, and data related to your position and organization/employer) in order to send you marketing materials and offers, to inform you about the changes and developments in our Services portfolio and in genetic testing field that may interest you.
2. Principles of processing the Data
Asper Biogene processes Data in compliance with the European principles of data protection – such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation and data minimization principles etc – and the requirements of applicable laws. Asper Biogene considers your interest, rights and freedoms to be the priorities when processing the Data.
3. The ground and extent of processing the Data
As a data controller Asper Biogene processes your Data mainly for the performance of a contract concluded with you for the provision of Services. Asper Biogene processes your Data only to the extent needed for the establishment of such objectives.
The processing of Data may be necessary also for the performance of Asper Biogene obligations arising from the law (e.g. in relation to providing information to Estonian electronic health system, accounting etc).
In some cases, Asper Biogene may wish to use your Data for performing research or making statistics. In the first case Asper Biogene (or your doctor or the employee of the distributor) will inform you about the possibility and ask your consent to participate in the research when placing the order for Services. Asper Biogene processes your Data for statistical purposes on the ground of legitimate interest of Asper Biogene, which means the balance between the interests of Asper Biogene and your rights. Asper Biogene cannot provide to you the best Services and the development of the Services without making statistics and analyzing the market. Nonetheless, the impact of such Data processing to your rights is minimal, as results of such processing is impersonalized.
In case you belong to an organization of Asper Biogene’s partner (medical institution or distributor of Services), then Asper Biogene processes your Data for the purposes of sending you marketing information only in case you have given Asper Biogene a prior consent for that. The provision of your consent is free and independent from the Services provided by Asper Biogene to you or your organization. In addition, you may always withdraw your consent by sending a respective notice to Asper Biogene or by clicking to the link provided at the end of the e-mail.
In case the Services are ordered by medical institution or some distributor, then Asper Biogene processes your Data as a data processor on behalf of and on the basis of the agreement concluded with such medical institution or distributor (i.e. data controller). In this case the ground, extent and conditions for processing your Data shall be determined by respective medical institution or the distributor of Services.
4. Passing the Data and data processors
In case you or the person who ordered the Services for you is located in the European Economic Area, then Asper Biogene processes your Data mainly within European Economic Area and shall not transfer the Data to third countries or international organizations. In case Asper Biogene does this, then it guarantees that the Data shall be transferred only to such a third country or international organization that complies with the same data protection requirements that are in essence equal to the level of protection applied in European Economic Area.
In case you or the person who ordered the Services for you is located outside of the European Economic Area, then Asper Biogene processes and passes your Data also to third countries. In this case your service provider shall guarantee that your Data is protected and processed in compliance with the laws of the state that you or your service provider is located.
Asper Biogene shall keep your Data confidential and shall not disclose them to third persons, except in cases it is needed for the provision of the Services, in case you have given to Asper Biogene a clear consent for that or in case there is some other legal ground for disclosure (e.g. ground arising from the law). Asper Biogene uses modern security measures for the secure and compliant passing of the Data. Upon your request and in case it is technically possible (i.e. mainly in case you have Estonian ID card), Asper Biogene uses encryption for sending the answers of the tests performed in the course of provision of the Services.
In some cases, it is needed to use third persons to process the Data – these persons are called processors. Processors process the Data on behalf of Asper Biogene only if it’s necessary for the purposes of Data processing and only on the condition that the processor provides the level of protection of the Data as required by applicable laws. Asper Biogene uses mainly the following processors and sub-processors (provided by categories):
• Developer and controller of Estonian electronic health system, who processes your Data to guarantee the proper functionality and development of the system;
• Other IT-services providers, who help Asper Biogene to securely store, systemize and in other ways process the Data and guarantee the proper performance and development of Asper Biogene website and other software used for the provision of Services;
• Advertising and marketing partners, including messaging providers, who help Asper Biogene to deliver you marketing materials and offers;
• Web analytics service providers. Asper Biogene uses Google Analytics (Google LLC) to monitor and analyze the website traffic. You can opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on – https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout– for your web browser.
• Accounting services providers;
• Laboratory services providers.
In case Asper Biogene processes your Data as data processor on behalf of medical institution or distributor of Services (please see Clause 1), then Asper Biogene passes your Data to such medical institution or distributor of Services.
5. Storing of the Data
Asper Biogene stores the Data on paper and electronically for as long as there may arise some claims from the contractual relationship or as demanded by applicable laws (e.g. Asper Biogene must preserve the results of the tests related to provision of health care services for 30 years). The Data that is no longer needed for the provision of Services ordered by or for you or for the performance of data storing obligation arising from the law, shall be deleted within reasonable time.
In case you have given to Asper Biogene your consent for receiving marketing materials and offers, Asper Biogene shall store your respective Data without a term until you withdraw the consent.
