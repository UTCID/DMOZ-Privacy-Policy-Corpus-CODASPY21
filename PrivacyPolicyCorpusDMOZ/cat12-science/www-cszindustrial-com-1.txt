Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information

this information may be collected and used by others. Note: CSZ Industrial
does not read any of your private online communications.
CSZ Industrial encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites

for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the CSZ Industrial
and CSZ Industrial family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information
CSZ Industrial collects and uses your personal information to operate the CSZ Industrial

your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services
available from CSZ Industrial and its affiliates. CSZ Industrial may also
contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services
or of potential new services that may be offered.
CSZ Industrial does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
CSZ Industrial may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business
partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases,
your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone

Use of Cookies
The CSZ Industrial Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CSZ Industrial pages, or
register with CSZ Industrial site or services, a cookie helps CSZ Industrial
to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
and so on. When you return to the same CSZ Industrial Web site, the information
you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CSZ Industrial
features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
the interactive features of the CSZ Industrial services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
CSZ Industrial secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. CSZ Industrial secures the personally identifiable information
you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit
card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use
of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
CSZ Industrial will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect
company and customer feedback. CSZ Industrial encourages you to periodically
review this Statement to be informed of how CSZ Industrial is protecting your
information.
