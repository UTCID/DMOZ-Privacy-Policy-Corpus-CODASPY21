Privacy Policy
Inspect USA ® cares about protecting your personal information, we appreciate your trust and want to ensure
you that your information will be used carefully and sensibly. By visiting InspectUSA.com, you are accepting the practices described in this
Privacy Policy.Opt-out ChoiceYou can opt-out as follows:
forward the email, account or correspondence in question to us: Contact us
Why Do We Gather Customer Information? The limited information we obtain helps us personalize and continually improve your
shopping experience. We only store information you enter on our web site when you search, buy, bid, post, participate in a contest or
questionnaire, update your account or communicate with customer service. We use the information you provide to respond to your requests, customize future
shopping visits, improve our store and communicate with you. To provide better product
recommendations, special offers we think will interest you or other personalized services, we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to your
account. Updated delivery and address information, from our shippers or other sources, is used to validate our records to improve future
deliveries or correspondence.
Cookies - We also use cookies, which are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to your computer through your web browser,
to enable our store to recognize and remember you. Cookies provide features such as automatic login and permanent shopping carts that can hold items you put in your shopping cart between visits.
Cookies also allow you to take full advantage of some of InspectUSA.com's most interesting features and we recommend that you configure your browser to accept them.
You have no obligation to provide any information or receive correspondence even though it might be needed to make a purchase.
Receiving eMail is voluntary and you can adjust the settings on the newsletter menu in your account to control correspondence.
Inspect USA ® Does Not Sell Customer Information - Your information is an important part of our business and
we do not sell it. We share customer information only within our organization. Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of
other businesses, but we do not provide your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers please adjust your
account newsletter preference to "no".
We may employ other companies and individuals to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal mail and eMail, remove repetitive
information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments and provide customer service. These people or companies have access to
personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Other than as stated above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third
parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
As Inspect USA ® grows, we might sell or buy other stores or assets. In such transactions,
customer information is one of the transferred business assets. We may also release account and other personal information when we believe it is
appropriate to comply with law enforcement; for fraud protection and credit risk reduction; to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or to protect the
rights, property, or safety of Inspect USA ®, our users or others.
Inspect USA® Protects Your Information - We work very hard to protect the security of your information during transmission and we do NOT store credit card numbers. (Which is why we ask you to repeat your credit card number if there is ever a change to your transaction.)
We also use PayPal as one of our credit card processors, which prevents our store from seeing your credit card number. PayPal protects your privacy and information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
software, which encrypts information you input. You can also protect against unauthorized access to your account by always signing off when finished using a shared computer.
Revisions - If you choose to visit InspectUSA.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice,
limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of North Carolina. If you have any concern about privacy on this web site,
