Online Behavioral Advertising Notice
Smithsonian Philanthropic and Revenue Generating Activities Online Behavioral Advertising Notice
In order to provide a more relevant online experience, some of the ads that you see on our sites and other sites and digital applications are customized based on your previous online activity on our sites and other sites. The information may be used to predict your interest in future ads related to your interests. The advertising practice is called online behavioral advertising (OBA). By presenting ads relevant to your interests, we hope to enhance your experience on our websites.
Where can I learn more about the information collected?
You may learn more about our practices by reading our Privacy Policy and online advertising, including OBA, at www.aboutads.info/consumers.
What choices do I have about online behavioral advertising from Smithsonian Enterprises websites?
You can opt out from receiving ads relevant to your interests from "third parties" that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) program and are identified on their opt-out page. If you elect to opt out of OBA, you will still receive the same number of ads as before, but they may not be as relevant to you. Opting- out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to opt out again.
How can I learn more?
Learn more about the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising from www.AboutAds.info.
Learn more about online advertising from the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/.
Learn more from the Interactive Advertising Bureau at http://www.iab.net/privacymatters/, including how to manage cookies using your browser controls.
