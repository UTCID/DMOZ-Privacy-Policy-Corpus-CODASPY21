Description
Session Cookies
Are used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server's pages. By default, web pages really don't have any 'memory'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn't have to remember or start navigating the site all over again. Cookies act as a sort of â€œbookmarkâ€ within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put in the shopping cart.
TO DISABLE ALL COOKIES
You can refuse consent to the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.The following section provides links that explain how to disable cookies for the most popular browsers (for other browsers, we suggest looking for the option in the help section of the software).
