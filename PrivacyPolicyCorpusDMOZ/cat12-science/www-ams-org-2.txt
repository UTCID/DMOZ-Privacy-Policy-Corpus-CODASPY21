These model clauses are contract templates developed by the EC as a mechanism for contracting parties to legalize the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland.
Please note that the model clauses will apply to the extent there is not another legal basis in place to validate the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.
To learn more about the EC's model clauses, please visit http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm.
AMS has further committed to refer unresolved complaints to JAMS Mediation and Arbitrators ("JAMS"), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the U.S. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com for more information or to file a complaint.
