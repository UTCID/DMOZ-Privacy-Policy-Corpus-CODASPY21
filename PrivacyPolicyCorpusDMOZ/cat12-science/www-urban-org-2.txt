5. Access and Availability of Third-Party Services and Links
5.1 The Services contain links to websites operated by persons other than the Institute that will let you leave the Urban Institute’s Site.  The Institute is not responsible for the availability of these outside resources, their contents, any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or update to such site.

The Institute does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Services by any user, information provider, or any other person or entity.  The opinions posted on the Site are solely those of the author and not of the Urban Institute or its officers, staff, board, funders, or organizations with which it may have a relationship.
The Institute does not warrant that this Site or its servers, or email sent from the Institute are free of viruses or other harmful components.

If a court finds any provision in these Terms of Use to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.
13. Miscellaneous
13.1 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will serve to preempt the promises made in policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.
13.2 The failure of the Institute to enforce any provisions of the Terms or to respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its rights to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect with similar breaches.
