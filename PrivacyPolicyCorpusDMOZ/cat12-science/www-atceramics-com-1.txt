You may not use or export any materials on the Site in violation of United States’ or any other jurisdiction’s export, re-export, or import laws and regulations.
MiscellaneousThese Terms of Use and the relationship between you and ATC are governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions, but specifically excluding the provisions of the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods, the 1974 Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods, and the Protocol amending the 1974 at Vienna, April 11, 1980. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. By using the Site, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Site or these Terms of Use must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or be forever barred.

Neither the course of conduct, course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade between the parties shall act to interpret, construe, qualify, explain, supplement or modify any of these Terms of Use. ATC may assign its rights and duties under these Terms of Use to any party at any time without notice to you.
