What We Do
What We Do
For 20 years, we have built systems, dashboards, and tools to create more effective, open, and engaging institutions.
Through implementations across sectors, countries, and contexts, we’ve seen firsthand what makes data, technology, and evidence effective. We use this expertise to advise governments, agencies, and organizations to better monitor, evaluate, and use data.
Our work is informed by action-oriented research, built on tested and flexible approaches that generate pragmatic lessons for global policy and implementation.

Our Expertise
Our Expertise
Effective Service Delivery
We cultivate data use to drive more inclusive and effective delivery of public services. We build digital dashboards and open-source tools that identify and fill key data gaps to support data-informed decision-making.
Resource Governance
How government resources are tracked, managed, and used is central to institutional accountability. Since the launch of the Aid Management Program, DG has built and maintained a strong footprint in public financial management. Today, we also act as a link between country-level users and global data standards, providing critical feedback on what governments and civil society need in order to better use these data.
Data Strategy & Policy
Through technical implementations across the globe, we know what makes data, technology, and evidence effective. This perspective supports governments, international organizations, and local leaders in their data strategy and policy formulation.

About Us
Who We Are
Our Work
We create tools that help institutions collect and analyze information; strengthen capacity to use data; and explore what incentives, structures, and processes are needed to enable evidence-based decisions. Our work spans technical assessments, agile tool development, capacity strengthening, facilitating learnings, and fostering long-term stakeholder relationships.
A Global Team
Based in more than a dozen countries, our global team benefits from diverse perspectives, an understanding of national and community-level contexts, and mutual trust from governments and partners.
Values-Driven
We believe that lasting change can be achieved by understanding and improving motivation for data use; addressing power dynamics and political barriers to collaboration and evidence use; and increasing trust between institutions and the communities they serve.

The State of Data in DG’s Work
As we review our strategy, we plan to share here much of what we’ve learned through programming in more than a dozen countries – from our work and from our excellent partners – about the state of data in agriculture, tobacco control, open contracting, and the extractive industries. For each theme, we’ll explore who are the key data users, the decisions they make, the most important data gaps, and the crucial risks of data (mis)use. Here we share previews from some of our flagship programs.
