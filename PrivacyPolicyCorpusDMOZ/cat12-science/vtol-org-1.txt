Privacy Policy
The Vertical Flight Society (formerly the American Helicopter Society International or "AHS") is dedicated to protect the privacy of its members, website users, and all those who interact with the Society. To that end, VFS has adopted a comprehensive privacy policy. In summary:
VFS collects and uses different kinds of information from users of its website. It is the policy of the Society that data provided will be used strictly for internal purposes only.
We may ask for information such as your address, phone number, and/or e-mail address when you place an order for a product or service, complete a survey, register for a conference, apply for membership, or on other occasions. In each case, our objective is to have your contact information so that we can serve you better. Your submission of this information to us is your "positive consent" that you wish us to provide the goods and services that you have requested, and/or other benefits. Any email recipient may unsubscribe at any time from our electronic communications.
Effective May 25 of 2018, the new European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required that organizations obtain consent from all participants who are EU “data subjects” for the use of their personally identifying information. This includes names, contact information, and email addresses. The Vertical Flight Society, as an international organization, complies with GDPR. Citizens of the EU or any country who wishes to have their personally identifyable data erased may contact us to do so; we will not, however, be able to provide any benefits or services without contact information.
Although our most frequent means of communication is through email, the Society adheres to the "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act" of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act), 15 U.S.C. §§ 7701–7713 as amended, which imposes detailed requirements on entities that initiate and send commercial email messages.
The Vertical Flight Society collects and utilizes different kinds of information from users of the Society's websites. Like most websites, the Society uses “cookies” for several legitimate purposes. These include remembering user IDs and passwords and differentiating between repeat and new users. It is the policy of the Society that data generated by cookies will be used for internal purposes only (e.g., to improve the site and site-related services for users). The data compiled via cookies is considered confidential and will not be sold to entities outside of the organization.
Security
The Society makes every effort to ensure that all personally identifiable information collected on our site remains secure. VFS staff treats member and customer information confidentially. However, VFS cannot provide a guarantee against inadvertent disclosure or intentional misappropriation of data by a third party.
Encryption
All sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, etc., is only transmitted over 128-bit SSL encryption. Our site is verified secure by Network Solutions / GeoTrust, Inc. / RapidSSL CA.

Sales and Refund Policy
Sales done through our site are final, unless the customer contacts VFS with a reasonable explanation for refunding the money. VFS does not take responsibility for items lost in the mail.
Registration for our workshops and conferences are subject to a cancellation fee. Based on the schedule assigned to each event, refunds can only be made up to certain date.
There are no refunds on memberships.
Antitrust Policy
The Vertical Flight Society strictly observes all US laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust regulations.
