The Aspen Institute (“Institute”) values your privacy. Because the Institute gathers certain types of information from and about users of our digital properties, we want you to fully understand our policies and the terms and conditions surrounding the gathering and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses how we gather, use, and disclose information about you when you are engaged on Institute websites, apps, and other digital properties.
The policies below are applicable to the website located at www.aspeninstitute.org and any other websites, apps or digital properties under the control of the Aspen Institute, in whatever manner the properties are accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise, and other interactive features, applications (including mobile applications), or downloads that are operated by the Aspen Institute (“we” and “us”) that are made available by us. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information that you may submit to digital properties maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.

Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our service providers may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to better understand your use of our digital properties. We or our service providers may combine this information with other information, including personally identifiable information, we or they collect about you. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our digital properties, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to better understand popular usage of our digital properties. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block.
Pixel tags display tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your device, pixels are embedded on pages. We may use pixel tags (also referred to as clear GIFs or beacons), in connection with our digital properties to understand the activities of users of our Services, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We or our third-party service providers may use similar methods in emails to help us understand email response rates and identify when our emails are viewed.
Third-Party Analytics
We may use third-party analytics tools to better understand how audiences use our digital properties. Along with our service providers, we use these tools to improve our content and user experiences. These analytics tools may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as pixel tags, to perform their services. Such analytics products include Google Analytics. For more information about Google’s privacy practices, please see the Google Privacy Policy.
Security
The Institute has taken steps to help protect the personal information we collect and we review the security practices of vendors trusted to process data for the Institute. But no transmission and storage of data is completely secure, and submissions are at your sole risk. Our digital properties may contain links to sites operated by third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this policy do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as comment areas, message boards, social media platforms, or feedback sections, becomes public, and therefore this privacy policy does not apply to information you choose to make public. Please be careful about what you choose to disclose. Do not post any personal information that you expect to keep private.
GDPR: Personal Information
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a European Regulation concerning the use and processing of personal information. We are committed to processing your information in compliance with the GDPR. We will use reasonable efforts to securely process all personal information in line with the rights specified under the GDPR, in particular those related to the following requests:
Access to your personal information;
Correction of the personal information that we hold;
Deletion of your personal information;
A restriction of processing of your personal information;
Transfer of your personal information to another party; or
Objection to processing of your personal information based on the Aspen Institute’s legitimate interest (or those of a third party) to use it and there is something about your particular situation that causes you to object to such processing.
We hold your information and use it as described in this Privacy Policy and will use reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.
We consider that the Aspen Institute has a legitimate interest in collecting and processing your information. The Aspen Institute is an educational and policy studies organization with a mission to foster leadership based on enduring values and to provide a nonpartisan venue for dealing with critical issues; pursuing this mission is not in conflict with your rights. This provides our lawful basis to use your personal information, within the limitations set forth herein. Additionally, there are circumstances where the Institute has a contractual basis or other legal obligation for collecting and processing your information.

Comments that the Institute deems to include profanity, hate speech, personal attacks, or libelous, defamatory, discriminatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive or otherwise illegal (including violations of copyright or trademark laws) or unacceptable material may be removed. We reserve the right to block or remove the posting privileges of commenters who violate these standards of decorum at any time.
