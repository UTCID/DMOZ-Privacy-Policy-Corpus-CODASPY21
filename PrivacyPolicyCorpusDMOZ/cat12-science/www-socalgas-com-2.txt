Dispute Resolution
Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes
BY USING, ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OBTAINING OR PROVIDING INFORMATION FROM OR TO THIS WEB SITE, USERS EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN USERS AND COMPANY ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE WEB SITE, INCLUDING CONTROVERSIES RELATING TO THE APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR VALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR OUR PRIVACY POLICY (COLLECTIVELY “DISPUTES”), SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH HEREIN. ANY PARTY MAY FILE A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY BY CLICKING HERE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CLAIM CANNOT BE RESOLVED INFORMALLY, USER HEREBY AGREES TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES THROUGH CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION, SAVE FOR THE ONE EXCEPTION SET FORTH BELOW. ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY ONE ARBITRATOR, WHO WILL BE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES TO THE DISPUTES. IN THE EVENT THAT THE PARTIES CANNOT AGREE ON A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AFTER SIXTY (60) DAYS, JAMS SHALL SELECT THE NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR FOR THE DISPUTES. THE COMPANY SHALL BEAR THE COSTS OF THE MUTUALLY SELECTED ARBITRATOR FOR ALL NON FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY JAMS’ COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES LOCATED AT WWW.JAMSADR.COM. USERS SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT THEY ARE BOUND TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, EXCEPT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO PROCEED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS SET FORTH BELOW. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses. User and Company further agree that for any claim of damages of less than $10,000, the arbitration may be conducted at plaintiff’s discretion solely based on written submissions. User and Company further agree that for any dispute that is less than $10,000 a utility customer can choose to file that claim in Small Claims Court in the county in which that utility customer is billed, or for all others in Small Claims Court in Los Angeles, California. If the dispute is brought by any utility customer of Company, the arbitration shall be conducted in the county where that customer is billed. If the Dispute is brought by any other party, the arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles, California. The arbitrator has the power to award injunctive relief, but does not have the power to award punitive damages. The dispute shall be governed by California law, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Waiver of Class Arbitration
To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis in each party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator does not have the power to consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Users expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. By using, accessing, downloading, installing, obtaining or providing information from or to, this Web site, Users acknowledge that they are voluntarily and knowingly waiving any right to participate as a representative or member of any class of claimants pertaining to any Dispute.
Enforcement of Arbitration Award
The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties subject to these Terms and Conditions, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Severability
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect and the invalid, void, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law.
Prevailing Language
To the extent there is any inconsistency, ambiguity, or conflict between the English version of these Terms and Conditions and those translated into another language, the English version shall prevail.
