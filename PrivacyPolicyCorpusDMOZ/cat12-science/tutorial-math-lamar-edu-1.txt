Mobile Notice
You appear to be on a device with a "narrow" screen width (i.e. you are probably on a mobile phone).
Due to the nature of the mathematics on this site it is best views in landscape mode.
If your device is not in landscape mode many of the equations will run off the side of your device (should be able to scroll to see them) and some of the menu items will be cut off due to the narrow screen width.
Your privacy is very important to me and in light of that I feel that I must disclose the following information.
I use Google Analytics to track usage statistics for this site.
Google Analytics tracks a variety of general information including things like browser and operating system type/version, country location of visitors, pages viewed, time spent on the site and frequency of visits.
To do this Google does set a cookie on your computer.
What Google Analytics doesn't track is who you actually are and I have no way of knowing that.
I use this information to determine where traffic to the site is originating, which pages are the most popular and the capabilities of the browser/operating system of visitors.
Knowing this information is important and useful when I determine new features to add and where I need to concentrate my efforts of the site.
I also use Google Analytics to help track some "behavior" on the site.
Examples are how people navigate through the site (i.e. do you use the side menu or the top menu to select topics, do you download pdf's (if you do) from the download menu or from the page with download URLs, do you use the print function etc.
This is done without any personally identifiable information and I only see aggregate amounts of the number of times say the side menu was used for navigation and how many times the top menu was used for navigation.
Knowing this information is useful to me in determining where to add links to new topics/features/etc and just generally if certain features are even being
used or if they can be removed.
The statistics tracked by Google Analytics will be shared with others only if required to do so by law or if required to do so by Lamar University.
Lamar University provides the computer on which this site is hosted and so I can't prevent them from viewing the statistics if they should require it.
This site will also, on rare occasions, set a cookie of its own.
When it does set a cookie it is only so the site will remember your decision in certain rare instances (most notably if you have chosen to hide a notice that I put on the site) and will never track any personally identifiable information.
