With Boombod she found a solution that actually WORKS.
Natasha Zeleza, 36, says she was in complete shock at how quickly she saw results with Boombod, and she feels driven to continue her weight loss journey'I had been trying to lose weight for some time, prior to using Boombod, with little success and I just wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin again.'I wanted to try something new and am not big on using weight loss supplements.

I'm so satisfied with the results and I will definitely reuse this product. I saw results quickly and have to say I was in complete shock!'I really enjoyed the lemon lime flavor, it was really tasty! My tip: once you empty the contents into the glass, as you are adding water stir vigorously to ensure the powder dissolves and drink it immediately followed by 20 oz of cold water.
Natasha's goal was to lose 20lbs, and since using Boombod she is already halfway there'Boombod definitely helped with portion control. I felt full most of the time, so when I did eat I ate less than I normally would have. Now I'm really cognisant of how much I eat even without using the shots.'I feel amazing! I'm energized and driven to continue my weight loss journey. I continue to eat well balanced and healthy meals. I definitely make smarter food choices than I did before.'I have recommended Boombod to every friend I have talked to. I was so impressed by the results I got.

Just take one Boombod shot, three times a day! Mix each sachet with 1/4 glass of water and drink 30 minutes before a healthy meal. Follow each shot with a full glass of water. Couldn't be easier!

'It didn't take long before I noticed my tummy going down and my skin started to look clearer too' Breezieanah Sakaria, 34, an assistant manager from West Valley, Utah, wanted to be healthier in her choices and was impressed by the fact that she could clearly understand Boombod's ingredients.
Breezieanah Sakaria, 34, has been using Boombod since January and she has been amazed at how simple and straightforward the process is  'I had been trying to lose weight for a long time before I tried Boombod.'I went on a family vacation and had to be discreet about asking for an extension seatbelt on the plane. But, the flight attendant couldn't hear me so she repeated herself in a loud tone and all my in-laws could hear. I just wanted to be healthier.'I had always tried to watch what I ate and I hit the gym so had never tried any other kind of supplements before starting to use Boombod in January this year.'It appealed to me because I could understand what the ingredients are and I really enjoy the Boombod shots. My favourite is the lemon lime flavor. They're simple, easy to use and the process was straightforward.'I take the shots about an hour before I eat a meal and I find I feel full but not bloated. And it didn't take long before I noticed my tummy going down and my skin started to look clearer too.
Breezieanah says that Boombod appealed to her because she could understand the ingredients, and she enjoys the taste of the shots'Boombod has been a big part of my weight loss journey and it really gives me a boost so I couldn't wait to try the Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies and they didn't disappoint me at all.'They taste amazing and they cover my daily intake instead of drinking the apple cider vinegar drink. They're the first thing I take when I get up in the morning.'Boombod is a brand I totally trust with my weight loss because I've been using it since January and not once had any side effects or any bad symptoms that would hinder me from losing weight.'If anything when I did stop taking the shots for two weeks I only gained 3lbs. Normally when I stop exercising and eating right, I'd gain a whopping 10lbs or more.' Want to find a weight loss solution you can trust?
