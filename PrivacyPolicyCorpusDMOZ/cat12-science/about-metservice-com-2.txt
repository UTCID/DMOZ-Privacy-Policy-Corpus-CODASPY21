API Terms & Conditions
MetService API Service Specific Terms and Conditions
Introduction
Thank you for your interest in our APIs. We aim to deliver the highest quality weather data available and are excited to see what you can do with it to enhance your own products and services.
These service specific API terms and conditions (API T&Cs) apply to your use of Data obtained through the MetService API Service (API) and form part of MetService’s general terms and conditions titled Terms of Use.  If there is any inconsistency, these API T&Cs prevail to the extent of that inconsistency.
When you access our APIs, you are agreeing to comply with these API T&Cs (as amended by us from time to time) and must continue to comply each time you access or use our APIs, so please take the time to review these. If you are agreeing to these API T&Cs on behalf of another person, organisation, or other entity, you confirm that you are authorised to, and do in fact, agree to these API T&Cs on behalf of that person, organisation, or other entity.  If you are a commercial customer, you must also comply with our general terms and conditions.
If you do not accept these API T&Cs, you are not authorised to access the APIs, and you must immediately stop your access and use.
In consideration for access to the APIs, you agree to pay the Fees (if any) as set out under any API Access Agreement between you and MetService, and comply with these API T&Cs.
1.  Definitions
1.1.  Capitalised words and phrases used in these API T&Cs have the meaning given in the Terms of Use.
1.2.  Including and similar words do not imply any limit.
1.3.  The following phrases have the stated meaning:
a. Access Request means a written request from you to become a consumer of MetService’s API.
b. Approved Purpose means the purpose specified in your Access Request, which is approved by MetService in writing in the API Access Agreement. Where no purpose is set out in your Access Request, the purpose is your internal business purposes.
c. API Access Agreement means the API access terms as agreed in writing between you and MetService, setting out the terms on which MetService agrees to provide the API, in addition to these API T&Cs.
d. Application means the application for which you require API access.
e. Attribution means the following italicised text: this data was provided by MetService Limited.
f. Data means any information and/or content that is made available by MetService via the API and includes, where applicable, Open Access Data.
g. End-User means an end-user of your Application that accesses or makes use of the API or Data.
h. Fees means the fees as agreed between you and MetService as set out in the API Access Agreement.
i. Intellectual Property Rights includes copyright and all rights existing anywhere in the world conferred under statute, common law, or equity relating to inventions (including patents), registered and unregistered trademarks and designs, circuit layouts, data and databases, confidential information, know-how, and all other rights resulting from intellectual activity. Intellectual Property has a consistent meaning, and includes any enhancement, modification or derivative work of the Intellectual Property.
j. Permitted User means any of your personnel who have a need to know, or access Data through the API, who are authorised to access and use the API on your behalf in accordance with clause 2.3.
k. Personal Information has the definition given to it in the Privacy Act 1993.
l. Systems means network, operating system, and the software of your web servers, databases and computer systems.
m. We, us, our, or MetService means the Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited.
n. You or your means you as the user of our API or, if applicable, both you and the other person, organisation or other entity on whose behalf you are acting.
2.  API Use and Restrictions
2.1.  You must register as a consumer of our API and at this time provide the necessary details and agree to receive occasional communication from us relating to the provision of the API and Data, including but not limited to security updates and notifications of outages.  When you register, you must describe the purpose of your Application and intended use.  If your application is approved by us, the purpose you provide will define your Application’s Approved Purpose.
2.2.  If you are issued access to the API via bearer token or API key (Access Credentials), you are granted a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the API solely for the Approved Purpose. You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your Access Credentials.  We may require you, at any time, to update or provide more information about the purpose of your Application.
2.3.  Without limiting the remainder of this clause 2:
a. no individual other than a Permitted User may access or use the API;
b. you may authorise any member of your personnel to be a Permitted User, in which case you will provide us with the Permitted User’s name and other information that we may reasonably require in relation to the Permitted User;
c. you must procure each Permitted User’s compliance with the requirements set out under this clause 2 and any other reasonable condition notified by us to you;
d. a breach of any term or condition of these API T&Cs by your personnel (including, to avoid doubt, a Permitted User) is deemed to be a breach of the Agreement by you;
e. you acknowledge that you will ensure the compliance of Permitted Users who interact with or use the API or any Data on your behalf, and agree that your organisation will be responsible for the acts and omissions of Permitted Users who interact with or use any API or Data. References to “you” and “your” is a reference to both you in your personal capacity and to your organisation; and
f. You must notify us and revoke access to the API for a Permitted User when personnel change.  If a Permitted User no longer has a need to know or access the Data through the API you must revoke their access immediately.
2.4.  You must ensure your End-Users’ compliance with applicable law, regulations, and the API T&Cs.

MetService’s determination may include considering average or estimated typical usage of the API or unfair loading on MetService network or underlying system. Without limiting the remainder of this clause, you must comply with any call restriction set out in the API Access Agreement.  The call restrictions are set and granted at our discretion, we may raise or lower the restriction limits at any time.

The Attribution must be immediately above, below, or beside the Data in a font size no smaller than the Data.  MetService grants to you a non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, non-exclusive, revocable, license while you use our API in accordance with the API T&Cs to display MetService brand features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the API.  You agree that we have sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of MetService’s brand features are satisfactory.
2.9.  In addition to providing appropriate Attribution in accordance with clause 2.8, you must not use or display the Data or make any statement regarding your use of an API:
a. in a way that:
i. states or implies partnership with or sponsorship by MetService, or that MetService endorses you, your business, or any product or service without our prior written consent; or
ii. is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive;
b. through any means (including a website), in any way, for any purpose, or in conjunction with items (e.g. advertising), that is objectionable (in MetService’s sole opinion); and
c. where that Data is not current.
2.10.  Your Systems must be properly configured to securely operate your Application and process Data.
2.11.  If you use the APIs to enhance a service offered to an End-User, you must ensure you operate that service and your Application:

c. to modify or reverse engineer the API; or
d. re-distribute, re-sell, sub-licence (whether for consideration or otherwise) to any other person or alter all or any part of the Data except as explicitly provided for in the API Access Agreement.

4.2.  If you provide us with ideas, comments, or suggestions relating to the API or Data (together feedback):

a. discontinue or change an API, including making backward incompatible changes; or
