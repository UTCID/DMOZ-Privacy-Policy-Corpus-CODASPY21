Overview
University of Houston-Clear Lake is committed to ensuring its digital content complies
with current federal and state accessibility requirements and with the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Compliance requires that a person with a disability be able to acquire
the same information, engage in the same interactions and enjoy the same services
as a person without a disability, and be able to do so in an equally effective manner
with substantially equivalent ease of use. Information and services must be made available
at the same time to a person with a disability as to a person without a disability.
Beyond that, UHCL strives to support sustainable, user-friendly, device-independent
displays to ensure all audiences can access information without the need for adaptation
or specialized design.
UHCL Web Accessibility Standard
To ensure accessibility, university web content must follow criteria outlined in the
World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG ) 2.0, Level
AA.
Responsibilities and Resources
Web content managers and content contributors are responsible for ensuring web content
meets the university’s web accessibility standard.  Web content managers will serve
as the accessibility lead for their college/department web content, working with content
contributors and subject matter experts to verify their area’s content is compliant.
The following resources are available to assist the UHCL community in understanding
how to create accessible content:
Web Accessibility Training
Web Accessibility Best Practices and Checklist
