Information and communications technology is arguably the key driver of productivity growth and innovation in the 21st century.
Australia’s manufacturing, production and services sectors will benefit from access to broadband and low-power network technologies for the Internet of Things, facilitating the widespread adoption of digitally enabled technologies such as 3D printing, nanoscale fabrication, machine learning and automation.
National capabilities in information technologies and digital engineering will underpin growth in all Australian industry sectors, including health, agriculture, finance, mining, education and other services sectors.
