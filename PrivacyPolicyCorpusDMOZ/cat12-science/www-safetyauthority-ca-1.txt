What is a cookie?
A cookie is a very small file that is placed on an internet user's hard drive. It is generated by a web server, the hardware (computer) or software (computer program) that helps to deliver web content via the Internet. The information the cookie contains is set by the web server and it can be used by the web server whenever the user visits the site. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned.
Cookies cannot access the user's hard drive, so a cookie can't read other information saved on the hard drive, or get a user's email address etc. They only contain and transfer to the web server as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to a website.
What does a cookie look like?
