Donor Privacy Policy
Donor Privacy Policy
Constitutional Rights Foundation (“CRF") is a non-partisan, nonprofit organization classified as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
This Donor Privacy Policy describes CRF's policies and practices with regard to the personal information we collect from our donors, volunteers, and supporters. This Donor Privacy Policy shall apply to the collection of information, both online and offline, including information collected through any of our websites, mobile applications, social media, as well as any other electronic, written, or oral communications. By submitting your information to CRF, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Donor Privacy Policy, as well as those stated in the CRF's Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by this reference, and to our using and processing the personal information for the purposes stated below.
CRF assures our donors, volunteers, and supporters that personal information will be handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.

Contact information such as name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address
Gift giving information (including payment information)
Information on events attended, publications received and special requests for information related to CRF or its programs

Use and Disclosure of Personal Information CRF uses personal information to provide our donors, volunteers, and supporters with better service and with information about CRF's events and support/volunteer opportunities. Payment information collected is used only for donation or payment processing and is not retained for other purposes.  We protect the security of credit card transactions using a number of measures such as encryption, access controls, network firewalls, and physical security. These measures make it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept the credit card information you send to us. When we work with other companies to process credit card transactions, those companies also use encryption and other appropriate security measures.

Use of your personal information by CRF will be limited to internal purposes and only to further the organization’s activities.  We occasionally communicate with CRF donors on the behalf of third parties about activities we are also involved in and if the activity furthers CRF's mission. To opt out of receiving these types of communications, please contact our Development Manager (See Contact below).
Discontinuing Contact Upon Request CRF will discontinue or change the method used to contact any person, including donors, volunteers, and supporters, as soon as possible upon that person’s oral or written request.
CRF will maintain records of all requests for discontinuance of contact, whether written or oral, effective with the adoption of this Donor Privacy Policy. CRF will maintain records to the extent necessary for legal or liability purposes.
