IGEM welcomes Climate Assembly report on the path to net zero
IGEM welcomes Climate Assembly report on the path to net zero
See IGEM's response to the Climate Assembly UK's final report sets out a clear, internally consistent and timely path for reaching the UK's target of net zero emissions by 2050.
Report: The path to net zero
IGEM response
IGEM welcomes today’s final report from Climate Assembly UK, a group of 108 members of the public brought together to understand public preferences on how the UK should tackle climate change. Public acceptability and changing consumer behaviours will be an important part of making the UK’s low carbon strategies a success. As such, engaging directly with the public on the issue of decarbonisation and including them in the policy making process is vital. Priorities emerging from the report include:
A clear national strategy
Flexibility at the local area level
Information and education for the public
Consumer choice
Fairness
IGEM support the Assembly’s backing for including hydrogen in decarbonising heat supply, alongside heat pumps and heat networks; acknowledging the call for local areas being able to choose the solutions that best suit them. The Assembly also backed a ban on new natural gas boilers by 2030-2035.
IGEM echoes the Assembly’s call for strong leadership from Government and a proactive approach to tackling the climate crisis. Today’s report will feed directly into Parliament and IGEM look forward to seeing some of the recommendations being put into action and congratulate those that have been involved in this valuable initiative.
Full details of the report can be found here.
