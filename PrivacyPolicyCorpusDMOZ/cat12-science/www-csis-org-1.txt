Intelligence, Surveillance, and Privacy
Examining the relationship among technological innovation, civil liberties, and intelligence systems.Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance face unique challenges in the twenty-first century. Privacy concerns have begun to collide with national security interests, and policymakers must be prepared to contend with both interests simultaneously. Commonly addressed topics range from encryption and espionage to intelligence reform and the Internet of things. Our programs leading the research in this realm include the Strategic Technologies Program and the International Security Program.
