WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR AT OR THROUGH THE SITE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.
WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, CURRENT OR TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE.
YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER, COMPUTER NETWORK, OR DATA (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA) THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THE SITE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUSES, MALFUNCTIONS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS THAT COULD DAMAGE OR ALLOW UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER, COMPUTER NETWORK, OR DATA.

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SITE IS APPROPRIATE OR AVAILABLE FOR USE IN ALL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. IF YOU ACCESS OR USE THE SITE FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, EXPORT AND IMPORT REGULATIONS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
12. Limitation of Liability
NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) SHALL BE LIABLE IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE SITE OR THE USE, ATTEMPTED USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLES EVEN IF FORESEEABLE OR IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY US FROM YOU TO ACCESS THE SITE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Therefore, the exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.
13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and release us, our subsidiaries, and our respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives (and their respective successors and assigns) from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or related to your access, use, attempted use, inability to use or misuse of the Site or noncompliance with this Agreement.
14. Export Controls and Designated Persons
The Site is operated from the United States and it is possible that software available at or through the Site may be subject to United States export controls administered by the United States Commerce Department or sanctions programs administered by the United States Treasury Department. No software available at or through the Site may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country subject to a United States or United Nation embargo or sanction; (b) to anyone on the United States Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons ("SDN List"); (c) to anyone on the United States Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List or Entity List; or (d) to anyone subject to the same or similar restrictions as the foregoing. By downloading or using any software available at or through the Site, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any of the above lists or subject to such restrictions.
Travel agents and anyone else using the Site for making reservations or travel arrangements are prohibited from making travel arrangements for “designated persons” that are government officials or residents of certain embargoed countries, or terrorists or drug traffickers or other persons or entities whose names are published on the SDN List. You agree to use all reasonable efforts not to arrange for any such designated persons to stay at, use, or tour any of our resorts, casinos, facilities, products, or services.
15. Arbitration
Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by individual arbitration in Clark County, Nevada before a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Any appeal shall be heard and decided by a panel of three neutral arbitrators. All arbitrators shall be retired judges or justices of any Nevada state or federal court, and shall in their substantive rulings (as opposed to procedural or discovery-related rulings that are otherwise governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures), apply the laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rules that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Nevada. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be binding and final on all parties. The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator(s) determine a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator(s) may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrators may not award any punitive, incidental, indirect, special, or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for lost profits.
Any dispute resolution proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including arbitration, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action on behalf of others. There is no right for any dispute here under to be brought or heard as a class arbitration, class action, or private attorney general action or for the consolidation of arbitrations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, and without waiving any party’s right to appeal, if this waiver of class action is held invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration clause in Section 15 (with the exception of this sentence) shall not apply.
16. Miscellaneous
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any breach or default of the Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. You may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions to access particular sections or functions of the Site. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without consent or notice, to transfer, assign, sublicense or pledge the Site or this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity. You may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer in any manner any of your rights or obligations under the Agreement. The section headings used in the Agreement are for convenience only. We may at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, modify or discontinue the Site or terminate or restrict your access to the Site.
