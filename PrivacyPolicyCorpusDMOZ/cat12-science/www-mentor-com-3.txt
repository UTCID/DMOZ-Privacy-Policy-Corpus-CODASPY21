Any such DMCA Notification must include the following:
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is requested to be removed or access to which is requested to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Mentor Graphics to locate the material.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit Mentor Graphics to contact you (i.e., the complaining party), such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, and who is subjecting him or herself to prosecution for perjury in the event that false statements are made therein.
Upon receiving a DMCA Notification in compliance with the above, Mentor Graphics will act to expeditiously remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.  If we remove or disable access in response to a DMCA Notification, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected content so that they can submit a DMCA Counter-Notification, if applicable.  We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act, and provide copies of notices of alleged infringement to third parties, at our discretion.
If your content has been removed by us in response to our receipt of a DMCA Notification as outlined above, and you believe the removal was inappropriate, you may submit a DMCA Counter-Notification by emailing the DMCA Counter-Notification to: tom_evans@mentor.com, or by mailing the notice to:
Mentor Graphics Corporation
DMCA Content Manager
Thomas L. Evans
8005 S.W. Boeckman Road
Wilsonville, OR 97070-7777
Any such DMCA Counter-Notification must include the following:
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district for which jurisdiction for Mentor Graphics would be appropriate, and that you will accept service of process from the person who submitted the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
A physical or electronic signature of the user whose material was removed.
Upon receiving a DMCA Counter-Notification in compliance with the above, Mentor Graphics will reasonably act to notify the person who provided the initial DMCA Notification with a copy of the DMCA Counter-Notification, and inform that person that Mentor Graphics will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it after 10 business days and no later than 14 business days.  At such time, Mentor Graphics will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to the removed material, unless we first receive notice from the person who submitted the initial DMCA Notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the web site.
