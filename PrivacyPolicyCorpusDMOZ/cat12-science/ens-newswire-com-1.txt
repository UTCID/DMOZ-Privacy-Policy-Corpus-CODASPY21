Environment News Service Terms and Conditions and Statement of Privacy
Environment News Service is committed to protecting your privacy. This Statement of Privacy applies to Environment News Service Web site and governs data collection and usage at all Environment News Service sites and services; it does not apply to other online or offline sites, products or services. Please read the Environment News Service Statement of Privacy. Environment News Service is a general audience web site, intended for users of all ages.

Collection of your Personal Information
Environment News Service accepts email and RSS subscriptions to our free news service.  To send you the news, we collect your email address on a subscription form that you fill out.

Environment News Service encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Environment News Service so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Environment News Service Web site.
Use of your Personal Information
Environment News Service does not sell, rent or lease its subscriber lists to third parties.
Environment News Service may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Environment News Service or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Environment News Service including its Web site; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Environment News Service or the public.
Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Environment News Service or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Environment News Service abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
Control your Personal Information
You may stop the delivery of future news or promotional e-mail from Environment News Service by responding directly to any email you receive with a request to remove you from the mailing list.
Security of your Personal Information
Environment News Service is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we use a secure payment gateway so your information is protected.
Changes to this Statement
Environment News Service will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. If there are material changes to this Statement or in how Environment News Service will use your personal information, Environment News Service will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change.
