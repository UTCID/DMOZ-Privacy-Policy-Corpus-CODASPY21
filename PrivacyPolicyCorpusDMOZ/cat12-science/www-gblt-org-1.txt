User Agreement for the Georgian Bay Land Trust (Georgian Bay Trust Foundation Inc.) Web Site
WELCOME TO THE GEORGIAN BAY LAND TRUST’S WEB SITE!
We’ve designed our Web site to be useful and informative. We hope we’ve succeeded — and we hope you’ll let us know how we can make it even better.
All we ask in return is that you abide by the Terms and Conditions that follow. Please read them carefully, because when you use our site, you automatically agree to them.
THANKS FOR VISITING!
Copyright © 2014 Georgian Bay Land Trust. All rights reserved.
The Georgian Bay Land Trust (“GBLT”) either owns the intellectual property rights in the underlying HTML, text, audio clips, video clips and other content that is made available to you on our web site, or has obtained the permission of the owner of the intellectual property in such content to use the content on our web site.
You agree not to re-use material from https://www.gblt.org or from any other World Wide Web site operated by GBLT. In particular, you agree not to copy, distribute, republish, upload, post, or transmit anything unless you get our written consent — first.
There are two exceptions. As a member of the general public you may download material onto one computer for your personal, non-commercial use only, provided you don’t delete or change any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices. As a member of the media you may download news releases, photos, and collateral information provided for your use, provided you also don’t delete or change any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices, and that you adhere to good business practices regarding the use and reproduction of such material.
But please don’t modify the materials or use them for any other purpose; if you do, you’ll be violating our intellectual-property rights.
Limited License
GBLT grants to you a limited license to display on your computer, print, download and use the underlying HTML, text, audio clips, video clips and other content that is made available to you on our web site, for non-commercial (personal or educational) purposes only, provided that:
(a) you do not modify or misrepresent any such content; and
(b) you include with and display on each copy of such content the associated copyright notice and this limited license.
Content authorized for release to media can also be displayed, printed, downloaded and used in keeping with the normal practices governing the release of authorized material by other means.
No other use is permitted.
That means that we retain full and complete title to the software and to all of the associated intellectual-property rights. So you’re not allowed to redistribute or sell the material — or to reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise convert it to any other form that people can use. Normal exceptions regarding the reproduction and redistribution of media material would apply.
No rights, other than displays, are granted with respect to GBLT trademarks. Any unauthorized use of GBLT trademarks is strictly prohibited.
No Warranties
GBLT does not warrant the quality, accuracy or completeness of any claims, statements or information on our web site. Furthermore, GBLT makes no representations about the suitability of any of the information contained on this web site for any purpose. Such information is provided “as is” without warranty or condition of any kind. This web site may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.
This disclaimer includes (but is not limited to) warranties:
* That the material is of any particular level of quality or fit for a particular purpose.
* That the functional elements contained in the materials will be uninterrupted or error-free.

In addition to the above, you (and not GBLT) assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
Another Disclaimer
We sometimes provide access to other World Wide Web sites from our sites. But we don’t endorse or approve any products or information offered at sites you reach through our site. Check the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address provided in your WWW browser to see if you are still in the GBLT site or have moved to another site.
Submissions
GBLT will not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any such materials. If, despite this request, you do submit material to us:
(1) All remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, or other information that you communicate to GBLT through this site (other than information we promise to protect under our Privacy Policy), become and remain our property, even if this agreement is later terminated.
This means that…
* We don’t have to treat any such submission as confidential.
* You can’t sue us for using the ideas you submit (including, but not limited to, product or advertising ideas).
* If we use them — or anything like them — we don’t have to pay you or anyone else for them.
* We will have exclusive ownership of all present and future rights to submissions of every kind. We can use them for any purpose, without compensating you or anyone else for them. You agree not to assert any ownership right of any kind in your submission (including, but not limited to copyright, trade mark, unfair competition, moral rights, or implied contract) and you waive the right to receive any financial or other consideration in connection with such unsolicited submissions including, but not limited to, credit.
(2) You acknowledge that you are responsible for any submission you make — in other words, you acknowledge that you (and not we) have full responsibility for the message, including its legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality, and copyright.
