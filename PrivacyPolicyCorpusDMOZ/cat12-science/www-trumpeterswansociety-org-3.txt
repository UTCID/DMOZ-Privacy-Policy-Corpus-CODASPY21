Your gift today will put a GPS Trumpeter Tracking collar on a trumpeter swan
Fund a Trumpeter Tracking collar
You can help right now to track a trumpeter swan.
Your gift today to fund a GPS Trumpeter Tracking collar will answer important swan questions as soon as the swan receives it.
You will give biologists who are working on swan issues the answers they need to give trumpeter swans the best chance at long term success in a changing world.
The collar you fund will answer:
Where did this swan spend the winter? Did it spend winter near its nesting grounds or far away? Where did this swan rest and find food during migration? Did the swan migrate through different areas in spring and in fall? What did the swan's movements look like on a nesting wetland- did it use all of the wetland or only parts of it?
You will help us learn if areas the swan uses during the year are protected or in need of protection and conservation.
Each GPS Trumpeter Tracking collar costs $1500.  Each collar is expected to transmit data for up to three years.
Your gift of any amount will be used towards the purchase of a tracking collar for where it is needed most.
Yes! I want to fund a GPS Trumpeter Tracking Collar!
