Privacy Policy
These web pages are provided as a public service by NOAA Great Lakes
Environmental Research Laboratory.
We are committed to the privacy of our visitors. We collect no personal
information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to
provide that information to us.
If you have any questions or comments about the information presented
here, please forward them to ().
Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site.
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read
pages or download information, we will gather and store certain information
about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you
personally. We automatically collect and store information like the following
concerning your visit.
The Internet domain (for example, "ncompany.com" if you
use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu"
if you connect from a university's domain);
Your IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access
our Web site;
The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
The date and time you access our site;
The pages you visit; and
If you linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of
that Web site.
We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors—to
learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology
our visitors use.
Information Protection
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available
to all users, this government computer system employs software programs
to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload
or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If such monitoring reveals
evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be
provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts
to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited
and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and
the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.
Information That You Voluntarily Provide
We do not collect personally-identifiable information unless you choose
to provide it to us. If you provide us with personally identifiable information,
for example by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting
it through our Web site, we use that information only to respond to your
message and to help us provide you with the information and services that
you request.
Submitting voluntary information constitutes your consent to the use
of the information for the stated purpose. When a user clicks the "Submit"
button on any of the Web forms found on our site they are indicating voluntary
consent to use of the information they submit for the stated purpose.
We do not collect or use information for commercial marketing.
How Information is Used
The information we collect is used for a variety of purposes (e.g., comments
on proposed rules, license applications, to respond to requests for information
about our regulations and policies and to fill orders). We make every
effort to disclose clearly how information is used at the point where
it is collected so that our users can determine for themselves whether
they wish to provide the information.
Sharing of Information
We may share the information you give us with another government agency
if your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances,
such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we
may be required by law to disclose information you submit. Before you
submit personally identifiable information, such as on an online form,
you will be advised as to the purpose and how the information will be
used.
Retention of Information
We destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was
provided has been fulfilled unless we are required to keep it longer by
statute or official policy. Electronically submitted information is maintained
and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and
the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives
and Records Administration, and in some cases information submitted to
us may become an agency record and therefore might be subject to a Freedom
of Information Act request.
Links to Other Sites
This site may have links to the Web sites of other federal agencies. There
may be links to private organizations, with their permission. Once you
go to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
It is always a good idea to read the Privacy Policy of any Web site that
you visit.
Cookies
"Cookies" are small bits of text that are either used for the
duration of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a user's
hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user,
the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies").
This Web site does not use persistent cookies or any other persistent
tracking technology. One or more of our component sites may use session
cookies to provide streamlined navigation. These session cookies are deleted
from the component's server after your session ends and information from
them is not collected or saved.
Interaction with Children
This Web site may offer educational content to children under 13. No personally
identifiable information is collected from them unless voluntarily submitted
as a request for information or services. The information collected is
used to respond to user inquiries or to provide services requested by
our users.
