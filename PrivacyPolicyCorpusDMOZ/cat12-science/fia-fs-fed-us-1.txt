Privacy Policy
This website is provided as a public service
by the USDA
Forest Service.
Information presented on this website is
considered public information and may be
distributed or
copied unless otherwise indicated. Use
of appropriate byline/photo/image credit is
requested.
For site management, information
is collected
for statistical purposes. This government
computer system uses software programs to
create summary
statistics, which are used for such purposes
as assessing what information is of most
and least interest, determining technical
design
specifications, and identifying system
performance or problem areas.
For site security purposes and to ensure
that this service remains available to
all users,
this government computer system employs
software programs to monitor network traffic
to identify
unauthorized attempts to upload or change
information, or otherwise cause damage.
Except for authorized law enforcement
investigations, no other attempts are
made to identify individual
users or their usage habits. Raw data
logs are used for no other purposes than
those stated
in this notice.
Unauthorized attempts to upload information
or change information on this service
are strictly prohibited and may be punishable
under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1987 and the National
Information Infrastructure Protection
Act.
If you have any questions or comments
about the information presented here,

To protect your privacy, this site does
not use persistent "cookies."
Information Collected for Statistical Purposes
Below is an example of the information collected
based on a standard request for a World
Wide Web document:
xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] "GET
/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" 200
16704 Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com
xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)-- this is
the host name (or IP address) associated
with
the requester (you as the visitor). In this
case,
(.com) the requester is coming from a commercial
address. Depending on the requester's method
of network connection, the host name (or
IP address) may or may not identify a specific
computer. Connections via many Internet
Service
Providers assign different IP addresses
for each session, so the host name identifies
only the ISP. The host name (or IP address)
will
identify a specific computer if that computer
has a fixed IP address.
[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is
the date and time of the request
"
GET /news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" --
this is the location of the requested
file on the
web server 200 -- this is the status
code - 200 is OK - the request was filled
16704 -- this is the size of the requested
file in bytes
Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type
of browser software used to access the page,
which indicates
what design parameters to use in constructing
the pages
www.altavista.digital.com - this indicates
the last site the person visited, which
indicates how people find our site
Requests for other types of documents use
similar information. No personally-identifying
information
is collected.
