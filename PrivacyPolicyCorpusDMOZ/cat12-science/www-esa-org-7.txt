Ecologist’s Guide to Policy
This publication focuses on opportunities to connect ecological information to public policy issues. Aimed primarily at ecological scientists, the book covers the Congressional and Executive branches-highlighting federal agencies with environmental regulatory authority or resource management responsibilities-an overview of key environmental laws, tips on effective preparation and communication during in-person meetings, congressional testimony, crafting opinion editorials, talking with rotary clubs, contributing to science blogs and working with the media. View the PDF here.
For tips on how to engage in policy, see ESA’s policy toolkit:
Meet with your lawmakers
Write a lawmaker
Make a public comment
Invite a policymaker to visit your field station or lab

Journals and Publications
Owners of domestic cats (Felis catus) express diverse perspectives on their pets’ hunting behaviors and access to the outdoors. In some regions, policies focused on confining cats indoors, or otherwise regulating ownership, can lead to noncompliance and at worst may contribute to conflict. In the December issue of Frontiers, Crowley et al. explain how tailoring communications and management approaches to better align with owners’ perspectives could increase participation in attempts to reduce their pets’ impacts on wildlife.
