Inno-Therm®/Metisse® is an
‘eco’ thermal and acoustic insulation made from recycled cotton/denim fibres. Recovery Insulation has manufactured Inno-Therm® and as a social enterprise donates % of profit to the Schools & Homes Energy Education Project to conduct renewable and energy/cost saving activities.
Encourage your students to investigate concepts of heat transfer through our Education curriculum resource we have developed called
the Hot House. It is designed for conducting practical experiments in thermal and acoustic science.
Use the Energy calculator to estimate how much money you could save by changing the type of lamp you use.
