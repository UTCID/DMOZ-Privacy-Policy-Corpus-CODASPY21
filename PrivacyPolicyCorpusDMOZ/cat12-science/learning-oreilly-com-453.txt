ConclusionIn this chapter we looked at a range of issues affecting host
and network security for organizations operating web servers. We saw
that practically every business decision that you make for your
computers can have significant security impacts. Many businesses treat
security as an afterthought, something that can be added after other
decisions have already been made—such as the choice of vendor, the
decision whether or not to use consultants, and the allocated budget
for personnel.A chapter such as this one cannot convey all the knowledge
necessary to securely operate a computer on the Internet today. This
is just an introduction to this important topic. For specific details
of securing a Unix computer on the Internet, we recommend our book
Practical Unix & Internet Security. Even
though the book was published back in 1996, much of the information
that it contains is still current. That book, combined with this one
and updates from your vendor, will provide you with the information
that you need to operate a Unix computer securely on the Internet
today.If you are running a computer with a Microsoft operating system
on the Internet, we recommend the book Securing Windows
