Working Group on Diagnostic Tests
The Royal Statistical Society has convened a Working Group on Diagnostic Tests, chaired by RSS president, Professor Deborah Ashby, and by Professor Jon Deeks, to provide for statistical evidence on in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) that are used for analysis or control of infectious diseases.
The RSS has been concerned that, during the Covid-19 outbreak, many new diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigen or antibodies have come to market for use both in clinical practice and for surveillance without adequate provision for statistical evaluation of their clinical and analytical performance.
The working group's key aim is to review the statistical evidence needed to assure the performance of new tests, for patients, decision-makers and regulators, with particular reference to IVDs for infectious diseases.

Considerations
Statistical issues specific to the diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases, including new emerging infectious diseases
Key characteristics to be evaluated when assuring the performance of an IVD test for an infectious disease
Design aspects of studies that are necessary to provide estimates of these key characteristics
Statistical principles to be followed by decision makers (including regulators) when assessing the adequacy of the performance of a test for its intended role in the protection of public health
Information that needs to be in the public domain to provide confidence in the performance of tests.
