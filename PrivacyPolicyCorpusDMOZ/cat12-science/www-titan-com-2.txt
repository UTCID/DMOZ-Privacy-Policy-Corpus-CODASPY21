Auto insurance
Protecting what's most important
We’ve grown from a small mutual auto insurance company, owned by policyholders who spent their days farming in Ohio, to one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world.
Today we still answer to our members, but we protect more than just cars and Ohio farmers. We’re a Fortune 100 company that offers a full range of insurance and financial services across the country. Including car, motorcycle, homeowners, pet, farm, life and commercial insurance. As well as annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and specialty health services.
We’ve served generations. Protecting what’s most important. Let us do the same for you.
