How to Make a Privacy Act Request Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)System of Records Notices (SORNs)
The Board is committed to protecting your privacy and securing the personal information made available to us. The Board limits its collection of personal information to that which is necessary to carry out its missions and responsibilities. The Board protects the security and confidentiality of personal information through various methods including security technologies and access controls.
The Board follows the requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects personal information that the Board maintains in a system of records. A system of records is a group of records under the control of the agency from which information about individuals is retrieved by name of the individual or some identifier assigned to the individual. The Board's System of Records Notices identify systems of records maintained by the Board and describe how the information is stored, used, and safeguarded. The Board also uses Privacy Impact Assessments as a key tool to ensure that privacy issues and protections are addressed within information technology systems that manage personal information in identifiable form.
The Board's Privacy program is led by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP), who is responsible for establishing the security controls for personal information and for developing, maintaining, and overseeing the Privacy program. The Board's SAOP is Raymond Romero.
Questions or comments about privacy matters or complaints of violations in connection with the Board's handling of personal information may be directed to the Board Privacy program staff via email at: privacy.comments@frb.gov. Complaints of privacy violations may also be submitted by clicking Contact Us and providing the requested information.
