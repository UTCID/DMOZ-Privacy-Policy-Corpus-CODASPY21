Effective Date: July 1, 2020
We know your privacy is important to you, and our aim with

Why we
collect your information
The term “personal
data” can have different meanings depending on applicable law. In general, we
use the term “personal data” to mean information that can uniquely identify
you, but we will treat information we collect from you as personal data
wherever necessary under applicable law.
We collect personal data about you for the following
reasons:
For our internal
efforts to operate and improve our business. This could include:
Enabling your use of our services and fulfilling
your requests for certain products and services.
Making the Site or our current products better.
Developing new products or new content for the
Site.
Using the information for internal financial
activities like auditing, billing, and forecasting.
Performing data analysis to identify ways we can
operate more efficiently or expand our business.
Verifying and maintaining the quality and safety
of our products.
For advertising and
marketing purposes. This could include:
Sending you information on promotions or surveys
we offer, or information about us and our events.
Enhancing, personalizing and evaluating the
effectiveness of the content of our Site, our communications with you, and our
advertising and marketing.
For our general
administrative purposes. For example, we may need your information to tell
you about important changes to the Site, manage your registered account, or
provide account credit or other customer service to you. We may also need your
information to administer promotions or programs we offer.
For social-media
engagement. We use social-media
accounts (including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram) to
engage with the public. This engagement allows us to build online awareness
about our company and our products; respond to messages through the comment,
message, or chat functions; collect aggregated information about interactions
with our content; analyze trends; identify and profile brand advocates and key influencers;
and conduct social-media listening of conversations about our company and our
products. When you engage with us through our social-media channels, the
platform providers will also process information about you. For further
information, please consult the privacy policy of the platform provider.
For
security purposes, as necessary to help us protect against, identify, or
investigate fraud or other criminal activity.
For other legal
purposes, if we have a legal obligation, or need to pursue or defend
against legal claims, for which we need to process your information.
For communication
purposes, to get in touch with you in connection with any of the reasons
discussed above.
How long we
keep your information
We will keep your
information for as long as we need it to carry out the purposes described
above, and as necessary to comply with statutory and regulatory retention requirements.
We will also keep your information as necessary to comply with other legal
obligations we may have, such as in connection with litigation.
What information
we collect about you

Information gathered
automatically. When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect
information directly or through our third-party analytics providers. That
information may include:
Your IP
address
Your
device identifier
Your
internet-service provider’s name
Browser
type and language
Operating
system
Session
identification number

terms, search results
Online
browsing data or “clickstream data” (e.g., date and time of access to the
Site, referring website address, pages viewed, features used, links
clicked, and other actions you take in connection with the website)
We (and third parties acting on our behalf) may collect this
information directly from your browser interacting with our Site. We may also
collect it through cookies and similar technologies, which typically work by
placing a small file (like a text file or graphic) on your browser, and the
file is used to identify your device and to collect information. In this
Privacy Statement, we use the term “cookies” in general to refer to these
technologies. Cookies are typically assigned to one of four categories,
depending on their function and intended purpose:
Essential Cookies: These cookies
are necessary for our Site to operate properly and enable you to use its
features.
Performance Cookies: These cookies
collect information about how you use our Site and are used to improve and
personalize future web experiences and deliver content more relevant to
your interests. Our promotional communications may include these cookies to
measure performance and deliver more relevant offers/content based on
preferences.
Functional Cookies: These cookies
allow our Site to remember choices you make and provide more personal
features as well as services you have asked for. The information collected
may be anonymized and is not used to track your browsing activities on
other websites.
Marketing Cookies: We use cookies
to help us deliver our content and advertising. You can find more
information below on advertising, including your choices with respect to
these cookies.
Most browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically.
You can deactivate the storing of cookies or adjust your browser to inform you
before the cookie is stored on your computer. You can find more information
about cookies and how they work at https://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
In the case of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising, you can opt
out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Digital Advertising
Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for
web properties  or at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices for mobile apps.
Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to
tell a website not to track you.  These
features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.
Instead, we collect, use, and share information as described in this Privacy
Statement regardless of a “do not track” choice.
Location-based
information. When you access the Site, we may collect information related
to your location through your device’s GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or IP address.
Your device may provide ways to prevent sharing your location, like disabling
location-based services or turning off your GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. If you
disable any location-based services on your device, you may not be able to use
certain features of the Site.
Information from
social media and other sources. We may collect information about you from
other sources such as our
affiliates, public and third-party databases, and other third parties. For
example, if you elect to participate in analytics, communications, or marketing
programs, including those offered or run by third parties, we may enhance your
information by obtaining or merging that information with technical, cookie, or
other data we collect or that we receive from third parties.
We may collect information when you interact with us through
social media. And if you link our Site with a social media
account, then we may collect certain information related to that account. You
may have the ability to control what information is shared from your linked
social-media account by adjusting the privacy settings for that account.
We also use a third-party
social-listening platform that compiles publicly accessible content on the
internet in order to create aggregate reports that allow us to better understand
our brand categories and more effectively market our products. This publicly
accessible content may include personal data, such as your name or username in
connection with a social media profile. To the extent we obtain any such information,
we will maintain it in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and use it only
for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.
How we share
your information
We may share your information:
With our affiliates and other companies in which we have an
economic interest or ownership rights.
With others working for us, which
includes third parties that perform services on our behalf such as running our
Site, sending communications for us, and executing marketing programs and
promotions.
With other third parties, such as
law enforcement or other government entities: (1) if we believe there has been
a violation of our Site policies; (2) if we believe that someone may be causing
injury to our rights or property, to other users, or to anyone else; (3) to
provide information to law enforcement; or (4) as required by law.
As part of a corporate restructure, such as a liquidation, reorganization, merger, sale of the company,
consolidation, change of control, asset or stock acquisition/disposition, or
other corporate combination. If that happens, we will use reasonable efforts to
make sure the transferee uses your information in a manner consistent with this
Privacy Statement.
We do not share your personal data with
any third-party vendor or website owner for their own marketing purposes.
Third-party
analytics
We may use third-party
providers to collect and analyze information about your use of the Site. These
providers may collect information about your online activities over time and
across third-party websites and other online services using cookies and other tracking
technologies discussed above in connection with your use of the Site. You may
be able to manage how these providers collect information by changing your
browser’s cookie settings.  Please
consult the What information
we collect about you section for more information about cookies. And remember that changes you make for one
browser won’t carry over to other browsers you use.

system if you believe it may be out of date or incorrect. And where you have
provided your consent for us to use your information, you may request to withdraw
that consent for future uses of your information. Where applicable, you may log
in to your account to update your information or preferences, which may include
revoking consent to certain communication outreach and marketing uses. You may
also contact us at the address provided in the Contact us section
below.
You may always opt out of receiving future commercial email or
text messages from us by following the opt-out instructions in emails or texts
we send you, or by contacting us at the address provided below. Please be
aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial messages from us, it may take
up to ten (10) business days for us to process your opt-out request, and you
may receive commercial messages from us during that period. Please note that if you opt out of future
text messages, this opt-out list is separate from our email preferences and
opt-out lists.
Even if you opt out
of receiving promotional and marketing material, we may still correspond with
you about your existing or past business relationships with us (e.g., any
purchase of our products or use of our services, or responses to your requests
for information either through the website or other means). We may also access
and view your information in the course of maintaining and improving the Site
and our services.

Privacy Rights section below for your rights and additional considerations. If
you are a Nevada resident, contact us here.
How we protect
your information
We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical
security measures designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized
access, disclosure, use, and modification. Although we strive to keep your
personal data secure, no security measures are absolute. Use caution when
transmitting personal data over the Internet.
Children’s personal
data
In light of the importance of protecting children's privacy, we do
not collect, process or use on our Site any information relating to an
individual whom we know to be under 13 years old without the prior, verifiable
consent of his or her legal representative. Such legal representative has the
right, upon request, to view the information provided by the child and/or to
require that it be deleted. Just contact us at the address provided in the Contact us section below.
Links to
third-party websites
We may provide
links to other websites maintained by unaffiliated third parties for your
convenience. But that should not be taken as our endorsement or approval of
those websites or their content. We do not maintain those third-party websites
and are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or quality of their
content. We make no representations or warranties whatsoever about any other
website which you may choose to access through our Site. You should review the
terms and conditions related to the use of any third-party websites before
using them.

Privacy Statement

from time to time. When we do, we will post it on the Site and include the

additional information in the verification process, and not for any other
