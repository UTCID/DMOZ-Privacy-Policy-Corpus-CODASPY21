1. Ordering and Payment
(15)
1.1 How do I place an order? Can I order over the phone?
Use our secure online shopping cart to place an online order at any time. Sorry - we do not accept phone orders.
Read more
1.2 What are my payment choices?
We accept the following:* PayPal * Major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover)* Checks and Money OrdersWe do not accept bank wire transfers. You can choose your preferred payment method when you check out online.
Read more
1.3 I want to pay with a check or money order. How do I order?
First, use the online shopping cart to place your order. Choose "Check / Money Order" during checkout. Be sure to actually submit your order by clicking on the "Place Order" button. Online ordering/checkout is required even though you will be mailing a payment.
Make payment out to "Agena AstroProducts" and mail to:Agena AstroProducts16313 Arthur StreetCerritos, CA 90703, USA
Please write your order number on your payment, or include a printed copy of your order.
Read more
1.4 Is there an order minimum?
We no longer have an order minimum. Shipping within the US is free for for orders over $20. For orders under $20, a $3.99 S&H fee will be added during checkout.
Read more
1.5 When will my credit card be charged? Why did you charge my card even though you said I will not be charged until my order ships?
Your credit card will be charged only when your order is packed and ready to ship, not when you place your order.
What you see on your online statement right after you order is not a "charge." It is a pending "authorization hold" placed by your card issuer that reduces your available credit limit. That hold will be converted to an actual charge when we process your order for shipping, or it will automatically go away after 1-3 days (depending on your card issuer's policy) if an order is canceled. That is how all credit cards work.
Read more
1.6 How do I change quantities or cancel an item in my order?
If you have already submitted your order, please email or call us immediately to make any changes. Once an order has been processed or shipped, it can no longer be changed or canceled.
If your order has not been processed, and if the new order total after any changes is less than the original order amount, then we will be able to edit your existing order. If your new order total is higher than the original order amount, then we will have to cancel your current order and you will need to place the order again for the correct items that you want.
Read more
1.7 How will I know if my order has been received or shipped?
You will receive an automatic e-mail confirmation of your order when it is received, and again with the shipping/tracking information later when it ships. If you placed your order via your online account on our site, you can also log into your account at any time to view its status. Please check your spam/junk folder if you do not get these emails before contacting us for these updates. It is also common for people to mistype their email addresses while ordering, so please be careful about this when you submit your order.
Read more
1.8 Do I have to pay sales tax?
Sales tax of 8.0% is levied for all orders shipped to an address in California. Sales tax will be automatically calculated and applied to your shopping cart during checkout. At this time, we do not levy sales tax on orders shipped outside the state of California.
Read more
1.9 Do you have item XYZ in stock?
Please check the product page on our site for the current availability. Our website shows the live stock status of all products at all times, so if our product page lists an item as being in stock, there is a 99.9% chance that we have it and you do not have to contact us to verify its availability.
If an item is not in stock, we will list the estimated availability date if we have one. If we are accepting back orders or pre-orders, then the product page will let you do so. If the item will be drop-shipped, then our product page will clearly indicate this. We do not play the games some other vendors play by misrepresenting our stock availability and then stringing you along once we have your order.
In some very rare exceptions, the listed stock information may not be correct if(i) we mess up and miscount items (sorry - it's rare but it happens), or(ii) the very last piece sells on one of our other sales channels (like eBay or Amazon) and before the software that synchronizes inventory across multiple channels has had a chance to update this stock information automatically.
Read more
1.10 An item I want is not in stock. When will it be available again?
In any niche industry like ours, availability times for out-of-stock items can be notoriously fickle, and can be unreliable or change often. If we have an idea of when an item might be available again, we will list it on the product page (on the top right, just under the "Out of Stock" message). If no information is listed here, then you can assume that we do not know when that item will be available again. In such cases, we recommend that you sign up from the product page to be notified via email when the item is back in stock again.
Read more
1.11 An item I want is not in stock. Can I still order it?
Sorry - we generally do not accept back-orders for most out of stock items as lead times for unavailable items in our industry are notoriously fickle and unreliable. In some cases, we may accept back-orders or pre-orders for items that we are confident will be available within a reasonable time (for example, only after they've been shipped by our supplier). In such cases, you will see a "Back Order" or "Pre -Order" button on the product page that you can use to order the item. So if a page states "Out of Stock", and you do not see an "Add to Cart" or "Back Order" button, then you cannot order or reserve that item.
Read more
1.12 An item I want is not in stock. Can you contact me and let me know when it's available again?
We regret that we cannot do this manually. However, for any out-of-stock items, you can sign up to be automatically notified when the item comes back in stock again. To sign up for this notification, just navigate to the product page and submit your email via the "Subscribe to back in stock notification" field. Note that you need to be logged into your Agena account to sign up for this notification.
Read more
1.13 Do you offer a price guarantee? Will I get a refund if your price drops?
In this age of online shopping, prices can often fluctuate depending on a variety of factors. We cannot offer extended price protection because of this and also because most manufacturers do not give us much advance notice of their sales or give us any price protection when they drop their prices. However, we will be happy to offer a store credit if an item's price drops within 14 days of your order (not delivery). You must request this credit which will be issued as a store credit good for use on a future order (within 60 days) at AgenaAstro.com only. This price guarantee is good ONLY for purchases and prices from our website and not for eBay or Amazon sales.
Read more
1.14 How do I obtain a copy of my receipt/invoice?
You will automatically receive a copy of your order via email when you submit it. If you created an account on our site and were logged in while placing your order, you can also see your order history and print invoices from within your account. If you checked out as a guest, email us with your order number, and we will email you a copy of your invoice. We are unable to mail paper invoices.
Read more
1.15 I placed an order but can't see it in my account. Why?
If you wish to retain and view your order history, you must first create an account on our website (optional) and then log in before placing your order.Many customers with accounts often forget to log in, check out anonymously as a guest, and then are unable to see the order in their account. In such cases, there is no way for us to reassign an order you placed as a guest back to your account. If you create an account when checking out for an order for the first time, that order will be linked to your account.

2. Shipping and Delivery
(11)
2.1 How much is my shipping cost?
Shipping is free within the Contiguous US if your order total is $20 or more. Shipping is $3.99 for orders under $20. This is also true for most products shipped to US States and Territories outside the contiguous US (excluding large/heavy items). During checkout, you can also opt to upgrade your shipping speed/method/carrier if you like. The easiest way to check this is to add the item(s) you want to your online cart, enter your state/zip code and see your costs/choices from the shopping cart page before you check out.
Note that shipping if free if you end up keeping your order. If you return it, then outbound S&H charges will be deducted from the refund amount. Complete details are provided in our "Returns and Exchanges" section of this help page.
Read more
2.2 Is US shipping really free?
Yes - if you keep the item you ordered. Shipping is not free if you end up returning it. If you return something, the outbound S&H costs we incur in shipping that item to you will be deducted from your refund total. For complete details, please see our return policy in section 4 below. Please understand that there is no free lunch. We provide free shipping to you, but it really comes out of our profit margins. So should you change your mind about wanting a product or realize that you ordered an incorrect item or if it does not work with your setup, it would be unfair to assume that we should bear the outbound shipping costs.
Read more
2.3 How will my order ship?
If you opt for free shipping, your order will ship via USPS first class, priority or media mail or via UPS Ground shipping, whichever is most economical for us depending on your location and your order weight/volume. You will be provided with several other shipping upgrade options during checkout if you want to use a specific carrier or faster shipping method.
Read more
2.4 When will my order ship?
Agena has developed a reputation in the astronomy industry for very speedy order processing and shipping. In stock orders received by 3 pm ET / 12 noon PT will usually ship on the same day. Orders received after 12 noon PT will continue to be processed until UPS and USPS pick up our shipments, usually between 1 and 2pm PT.
Read more
2.5 Has my order shipped?
You will receive an automatic e-mail notification when your order ships (please check your junk/spam folder before inquiring about this as automated emails often end up there). If you create an online account with us, you can also log into your account at any time to view its status. If there is any problem or delay with your order, we will contact you promptly.
Read more
2.6 When will I receive my order?
Delivery time will vary depending on the shipping method used (see "How will my order ship?" above) and your proximity to our location in the Los Angeles area.* USPS First Class Mail: 3 - 5 business days, Not guaranteed* USPS Priority Mail: 2 - 3 business days, Not guaranteed* USPS Priority Mail Express (formerly called Express Mail): 1 - 2 business days, Guaranteed* Media Mail: 4 - 14 business days, Not Guaranteed* UPS Ground: 3 - 5 business days, Guaranteed* All Other UPS Shipping Methods: As per the method you upgrade to (Next day, 2 day, 3 day)Note that these are typical delivery timelines and are NOT guaranteed by the USPS (except for Express Mail). In shipping hundreds of thousands of orders over 15+ years, our experience has been that more than 97% of orders arrive within this timeline. However, delays of up to a week or so occur in about 2% of shipments, and delays of up to 2-3 weeks can occur in some very rare instances, even for priority mail service. In case of first class or priority mail delays, please understand that once we ship your order from our local post office, there is nothing we can do but wait for the USPS to deliver your package to you. However, we will gladly take back your order if not delivered within 7 days for a full refund if you no longer want it (just refuse it upon arrival in that case). If you are not willing to accept this small 2-3% chance of delays, then please opt for UPS or USPS Express Mail upon checkout.
Read more
2.7 What is my order tracking number? How do I track my order?
You will receive an automatic email notifying you of your order shipment (be sure to check your spam/junk folder if you don't see this). Your tracking number will also be included in this email. Note that tracking information on the USPS/UPS websites can take up to 24 hours to be updated and visible, so please be patient if you don't see the tracking information right away.
Read more
2.8 USPS tracking shows that a shipping label was created but the order has not yet shipped. When will you ship this item?
Short answer: Your package was shipped right after we notified you. It is with USPS despite the message you see, and it is en route. It should arrive shortly.
Long answer: Often, even a few days after we’ve shipped your order, USPS tracking may show something like:
"Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item"or "Shipment Received, Package Acceptance Pending"
We ship all packages promptly after you receive the shipment notification email from us. We do not sit on your package for days on end as USPS tracking may incorrectly suggest. The messages above simply indicate that USPS missed the outbound scan on your package after getting it from us, and in such cases, tracking of the package will resume within a few days once the package reaches a distribution center at your end. This used to be rare but has now become commonplace since early 2019.
If you see the message "Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item," it means that we dropped off the package at our local post office but they forwarded it to the next point without scanning it. If you see the message "Shipment Received, Package Acceptance Pending," it means that our USPS carrier has picked up the packages from our warehouse ("Shipment Received"). However, a package is not considered to be "accepted" and in the USPS mail stream (even though the USPS mail carrier picked it up) until it is scanned at our local post office or distribution center, but they often miss the scan too, incorrectly leaving the tracking status as "Package Acceptance Pending."
Example:Note that there is no tracking once our carrier picked up the packages on April 29, until it reached Texas on May 4.
April 29, 2019, 2:24 pm Shipment Received, Package Acceptance Pending CERRITOS, CA 90703
May 4, 2019, 3:04 pm Arrived at Post Office FRANKSTON, TX 75763
[2 other intermediate tracking steps tracked but not shown here]
May 5, 2019, 1:10 pm Delivered, In/At Mailbox FRANKSTON, TX 75763 Your item was delivered in or at the mailbox at 1:10 pm on May 6, 2019 in FRANKSTON, TX 75763.

2.9 Has my order shipped? Or my order was mailed but it has no tracking or is stuck in Signal Hill/Los Angeles - what's up with that?
Short answer: Your package is delayed by the USPS. It is not lost. It will arrive in a few days. We are sorry for this USPS delay, and we thank you for your understanding and patience.Long answer: In Dec 2014, the USPS announced the closing of several processing centers around the country. These started taking effect in Apr 2015. Prior to this, we would see delays in fewer than 2% of packages we shipped via USPS. Since Apr 2015, we now see delays in about 4% of our shipments. Most of these are first class packages, but priority mail packages are also occasionally affected. This is a big increase in delays, but still a rather small percentage of the total orders we ship, and we are sorry that your order is one of the few that has been delayed. Unfortunately, neither the USPS, nor other retail channels like eBay or Amazon have updated their estimated delivery dates to allow for this new normal. Hence, the estimated delivery dates - which are estimates only - are now grossly incorrect for the orders like yours that get delayed. In all of these cases, there is no update in the tracking from when we process your shipment/hand it to the USPS at our end and when the package reaches a major post office close to you several days later. Here are some examples and yours might end up looking like one of these.Example 1: Priority Mail Delay - Estimated delivery time = 3 days; Actual delivery time = 10 daysNote that there is no tracking once the package left California on April 22, until it reached Arkansas 8 days later on April 30.Shipment Accepted SIGNAL HILL, CA 90755 April 21, 2015 1:19 pm[2 other intermediate tracking steps tracked but not shown here]Departed USPS Facility LOS ANGELES, CA 90009 April 22, 2015 10:01 amArrived at USPS Facility LITTLE ROCK, AR 72206 April 30, 2015 8:44 pm[3 other intermediate tracking steps tracked but not shown here]Delivered, In/At Mailbox LITTLE ROCK, AR 72202 May 1, 2015 1:52 pmExample 2: First Class Delay - Estimated delivery time = 3 days; Actual delivery time = 7 days Note that there is no tracking after we handed the package over to the USPS on May 19, until it reached Texas 5 days later on May 24.Shipment Accepted SIGNAL HILL, CA 90755 May 19, 2015 12:20 pmAr...

2.10 How do I sign up to be notified via email of the progress of my shipment at every stage after it ships?
You will receive an automatic shipment notification email from us after your order ships. This email will have a link to USPS or UPS to track your order. You can sign up for email and text notifications from those websites. Thereafter, you will automatically get an email or text from UPS/USPS at every waypoint where your package is tracked until it is delivered.
Read more
2.11 Can I provide special delivery instructions for my package?
Unfortunately, you cannot. We use USPS or UPS for all shipments. Your package will be delivered like all other mail you receive from your mailman/local post office/UPS driver. You can try to make these arrangements directly with your local post office or mailman. If the package does not fit in your mailbox and no one is home, USPS will leave you a note asking you to pick up the package from your local post office and UPS will reattempt delivery on the next business day.

3. International Orders
(12)
3.1 Do you ship all products outside the US?
We can ship most of our products to most countries. However, there are some restrictions that vary by individual products and/or brands. You can see the regions each product can ship to on the individual product page.
Another easy way to find out is to add the item to your online shopping cart and get an estimate of the shipping choices and costs for your country. If you see these estimates, then we can ship the items to your country. Otherwise, you will get an error message informing you that an item is not available for shipping outside the US.
Read more
3.2 Is there an order minimum?
No - there is no minimum order amount that you need to meet in order to check out.
Read more
3.3 Do international orders also ship for free?
No. International orders to not ship for free as US orders do. International customers will have to pay the actual shipping cost based on the shipping method you select.
Read more
3.4 How do I find out my shipping choices or shipping costs?
* Add your items to the online shopping cart.
* Click on the "Cart" link visible on the top right corner of every page.* In the "Estimate Shipping and Tax" box, enter your country, state and postal code information.* The cart page will refresh automatically in a few seconds and you will be shown several shipping methods and the actual shipping cost for each method.
Read more
3.5 How do I place an international order?
Simply add your items to the online shopping cart and check out normally. During check-out, you will be shown several shipping choices and the cost for each shipping method. You will be able to see all shipping costs before finalizing your order.
Read more
3.6 What are my shipping choices?
We offer US Postal Service (USPS) and UPS shipping options for international shipments. We do not use Fedex or DHL.
You will have the following choices with UPS:
* UPS Worldwide Expedited* UPS Worldwide Saver
Sometimes, only one of the two methods above might be offered for your location. Please note that while UPS is faster and safer, they will always levy brokerage and customs fees which you will have to pay UPS directly when your shipment arrives in your country.
You will have the following choices with USPS:* International First Class MailDelivery takes about 3-4 weeks after we ship your package. This can frequently take 4-6 weeks or more for several countries (8 weeks for Italy, Chile, and Argentina; 6-10 weeks for Russia and South Africa, 8-12 weeks for Brazil). THERE IS NO TRACKING OR TRACING/INQUIRY SERVICE FOR FIRST CLASS SHIPMENTS. Once your package ships, we can do nothing but wait until your package arrives. Please do not become impatient and contact us in 2-4 weeks if your package has not arrived. If you don't receive the package in 6-10 weeks, contact us and we will work with you to resolve the issue. If you don't want to take the risk of this delay, then DO NOT USE First Class mail - use Priority or Express shipping instead.* International Priority MailDelivery takes 1 - 2 weeks after we ship your package. This can sometimes take 3-4 weeks to several countries. The USPS provides some basic tracking information for Priority shipping, but it is not as detailed as the tracking provided with the Priority Mail Express shipping option below.* International Priority Mail Express (formerly called Express Mail)Delivery usually takes 5-10 business days after we ship your package. You will receive a tracking number with which you can track your shipment in detail from USPS.com. Again, these delivery times are NOT guaranteed by the US Postal Service. The most common reason for delays is slow customs inspection and clearance in your country, and can sometimes be very long, even for Express mail packages. Upon shipping your order, delivery delays are beyond our control. Delays are quite common but losses are very rare, s...
Read more
3.7 Will I get a tracking number to track my shipment?
Yes. However, the level of tracking detail provided will depend not only on the carrier and the shipping method you select, but also on the postal system in your own country. USPS First Class and Priority Mail services have limited tracking information, especially once the package leaves the US. USPS Priority Mail Express shipments are also tracked in greater detail. UPS packages are tracked in detail at all waypoints.
Read more
3.8 When will my order ship? When will my order arrive?
All orders are shipped on the same or by the next business day. For delivery estimates, please see "3.6 What are my shipping choices?" above.
Read more
3.9 What are my payment choices?
For international orders, we accept Paypal and major credit cards only. We do not accept any other form of payment, including checks, money orders or international wire transfers.
Read more
3.10 Why has my order not yet arrived?
The most common reason for this is international customers not reading our Help section before buying, and then becoming impatient, especially with USPS First Class or Priority Mail shipments. Please give your order sufficient time to arrive. See #3.6 above for an estimate of how long your order might take to arrive. If you have not received your order in the timeline stipulated above (in 6-8 weeks for first class mail, 3 weeks for priority, and 2 weeks for express mail), please contact us and we will work with you to resolve the issue.
Read more
3.11 Will I have to pay any customs fees or duties?
You are responsible for any duties and taxes that may be levied in your country. These are not included in the item price or shipping cost. We have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be or if they will be levied upon delivery. Customs policies vary widely from country to country (Some countries such as UK are strict about imposing hefty customs duties and brokerage fees). It is your responsibility to check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to buying. Customs fees are normally charged by the delivery company or your country's postal service, or collected when you pick the item up. The carrier (especially UPS) may also charge a brokerage fee for getting your package cleared through customs. These fees are NOT additional unpaid shipping charges as you may often mistakenly be informed, especially in the UK.
Read more
3.12 I do not live in the US. Can I have my order shipped to a US address?
Yes. Simply use our online shopping cart to place your order. There are no additional charges. Your order will ship free like any other US order. However, the warranty offered by some manufacturer's is no longer valid once the product leaves the US and we may request additional credit card verification before we ship your order.

4. Returns and Exchanges

7. Product Opinions and Recommendations
(1)
7.1 Questions like:
I have XYZ telescope. What eyepiece/camera/reducer/flattener/mount/etc. should I buy? Which is sharper/better - model ABC or model XYZ?
A: We regret that we do not make specific product comparisons and recommendations. There are too many variables that go into this - many of them highly subjective - so we refrain from this as a general rule. There are countless combinations of telescopes, eyepieces, cameras and accessories, and it is simply beyond the scope of any company or individual to have the specific input you are looking for.If you have a product specific question, we will be happy to try and provide any quantitative information we can, but we will not comment on performance issues or comparison between products. Sometimes there is a genuine difference between products and you get what you pay for. In other instances, products may be identical and you pay for the brand. Also, it is not that we don't want to help, but we have fallen into trouble for doing this in the past. Optical performance depends on how well the focal plane of a telescope, eyepiece or accessory match up. Very good individual products may simply not be compatible. This is often the case when you try and use a wide angle eyepiece in a fast telescope, or insert a focal reducer into the optical path. But perhaps most importantly, a lot of opinions and comments about performance are very personal and subjective. We've seen online comments where one person raved about a certain eyepiece at f/5, yet someone else was disappointed with the same eyepiece at f/8! What is "sharp" or "acceptable" to one person may not be so to another person, even if they use the same equipment.The only way to know if a specific item works for you is to try it out yourself in your telescope. And we understand that this isn't always feasible. However, with the internet and the tons of information available online, it has never been easier to research such issues before. Read product reviews on our and other sites. We also recommend that you peruse the many discussions on these issues on forums like AstronomyConnect.com, Cloudy Nights, Astromart, etc. and make a choice based on the collective wisdom and feedback of others.Again, we regret that we cannot give you the specific answers you want, but we're just being very honest. If there was a direct, quantitative answer, we would have given it to you. If there was a "best" eyepiece or camera or accessory, there would be no need for the many hundreds of items sold today in the astronomy market.
