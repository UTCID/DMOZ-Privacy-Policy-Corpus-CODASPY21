Data Privacy Notice
Includes California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) Compliance
Curbstone facilitates credit card processing by linking merchants with whom you do business, and credit card authorization networks.  Curbstone therefore collects, processes, and/or stores the following categories of consumer personal information:  identifiers such as your name and address, email address, and account name; commercial information, specifically, credit card transaction data, including your credit card number, CVV number, and specific transaction details such as transaction amount, transaction date, and transaction merchant.  It obtains this data from merchants.  This data is collected, processed, and stored for the specific purpose of facilitating credit card processing between merchants and credit card authorization networks and settlements between them and their bank/acquirers.  This data is only shared with merchants, credit card authorization networks, and bank/acquirers, and only in accordance with Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), and applicable laws and regulations.
Residents of certain states have the right to request that their specific personal information that has been collected be disclosed to them by providing a request containing authenticating information.  Residents of certain states may also request that such personal information be deleted.  In order to safeguard your personal information, requests for disclosure or deletion must be properly authenticated before we are obligated to honor such request.  Moreover, any disclosure or deletion of personal information in response to an authenticated request is subject to, and will be made in accordance with, all applicable laws and regulations as well as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”).  In certain circumstances, the applicable laws and regulations and PCI-DSS standards prohibit us from disclosing or deleting certain personal information.  In other cases, we are not required to comply with a deletion request if such deletion would prevent us from completing a transaction for which the personal information was collected, to provide goods or services you’ve requested, or to fulfill any contractual obligations between us and merchants, authorizing networks, or bank/acquirers in response to a transaction you’ve initiated.
California Residents Only - Effective only after January 1, 2020
California consumers have the following rights, subject to certain limitations and exclusions pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Cal.Civ.Code § 1798.100 et.seq.:
the right to request disclosure of all personal information collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose
the right to request deletion of collected personal information, subject to certain limitations
the right to request that a business not sell their information (i.e. opt-out); and if the consumer does exercise their right to opt-out, Curbstone may not discriminate against that consumer as a result of their opting-out
To exercise these rights, a California consumer should submit a verified request at the following link

or call our toll-free number at
888-844-8533
Curbstone will ask for certain personal information in order to verify your identity before making any disclosure, or complying with any deletion or opt-out request in accordance with the CCPA.  As noted above, any request for deletion is subject to Curbstone’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  As shown in Table 1 below, Curbstone does not sell your personal information, so the CCPA’s opt-out mechanism does not apply to Curbstone.  Moreover, your request to opt-out could effectively negate your ability to complete any credit card transaction processed by Curbstone.
Curbstone’s disclosures regarding personal information pursuant to Cal.Civ.Code § 1798.115 are summarized in Table 1 below:
