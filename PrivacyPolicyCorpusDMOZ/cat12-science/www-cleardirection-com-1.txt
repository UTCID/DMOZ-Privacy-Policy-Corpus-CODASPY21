Privacy Policy
We believe that a person's Profile and ensuing training and development reminders are the
property of the individual. Therefore the only time a company, member of a
company, or a member of one's family will ever see a person's Profile or
training and development reminders is:
1. If the person him/herself shows them to another person.
2. If the company has secured this agreement in writing prior to the person taking the Profile.
By setting up our web page as we have, we have protected the
confidentiality of each individual in accord with the above stated policy.
We can not and do not represent that we can in any way protect this
confidentiality once the products have been e-mailed to the addresses
which the participants have designated.
