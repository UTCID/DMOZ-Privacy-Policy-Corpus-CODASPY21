Part I. Web TechnologyThis part of the book examines the underlying technology that
makes up today’s World Wide Web and the Internet in general.Chapter 1 looks at the basics
of web security—the risks inherent in running a web server, in using the
Web to distribute information or services, and finally, the risks of
being a user on the Internet.Chapter 2 is a detailed
exploration of computers, communications links, and protocols that make
up the Web. It provides a technical introduction to the systems that
will be discussed throughout the rest of the book and that underlie web
security concepts.Chapter 3 introduces the
science and mathematics of cryptography, with a particular emphasis on
public key encryption.Chapter 4 specifically looks
at the encryption algorithms that are used on the Web today.Chapter 5 looks more closely
at the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
system that are used by “secure” web servers.Chapter 6 introduces the
topic of authentication and gives an overview of several classes of
authentication systems in use on the Internet.Chapter 7 focuses on the use
of digital certificates for authentication and introduces certification
authorities (CAs) and the public key infrastructure (PKI).
