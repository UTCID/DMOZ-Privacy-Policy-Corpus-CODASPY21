By visiting and using the DatasheetArchive Offerings or registering for the DatasheetArchive Offerings and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the DatasheetArchive Terms of Service that you can find at http://www.datasheetarchive.com/privacy.html and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.What This Privacy Policy CoversThis Privacy Policy describes DatasheetArchive’s practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the DatasheetArchive Offerings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that DatasheetArchive does not own or control or that do not support DatasheetArchive in providing the DatasheetArchive Offerings."Personal information" is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing."Anonymous information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the DatasheetArchive Offerings (“Users”).BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.General InformationAs a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Information hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Information. However, there are circumstances in which DatasheetArchive cannot take action without certain Personal Information, for example because this Personal Information is required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for DatasheetArchive to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Information.As part of a global group of companies, DatasheetArchive has affiliates and third-party service providers within, as well as outside of, the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). As a consequence, whenever DatasheetArchive is using or otherwise processing your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, DatasheetArchive may transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA.You can request from DatasheetArchive at any time details about which Personal Information DatasheetArchive processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Information. Please note, however, that DatasheetArchive can delete your Personal Information only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of DatasheetArchive to retain it. If you request that DatasheetArchive delete your Personal Information, you will not be able to continue to use any DatasheetArchive service that requires DatasheetArchive’s use of your Personal Information.If DatasheetArchive uses your Personal Information based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from DatasheetArchive a copy of the Personal Information that you have provided to DatasheetArchive. In this case, please contact the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like this information, and whether the Personal Information is to be sent to you or another recipient. SuppyFrame will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how we can best fulfill it.Furthermore, you can request from DatasheetArchive that we restrict your Personal Information from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Information DatasheetArchive has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as DatasheetArchive requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Information), (ii) there is no legal basis for DatasheetArchive processing your Personal Information and you demand that DatasheetArchive restricts your Personal Information from further processing, (iii) DatasheetArchive no longer requires your Personal Information but you claim that you require DatasheetArchive to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Information by DatasheetArchive (based on DatasheetArchive’s legitimate interest as further set out below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether DatasheetArchive has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Information.Please direct any such request to privacy@DatasheetArchive.com.Right To Lodge A ComplaintIf you believe that DatasheetArchive is not processing your Personal Information in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which DatasheetArchive has its registered seat.Data ControllerThe data controller of www.DatasheetArchive.com is DatasheetArchive.

User profiles provide the option to display personal information about you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company.These profiles may relate to a single Offering of DatasheetArchive or may also allow you to access other Offerings of DatasheetArchive or of other entities of DatasheetArchive, or both (irrespective of any consent granted under the section “Forwarding Your Personal Data To Other DatasheetArchive Companies.” below).

In case of withdrawal, DatasheetArchive will not process Personal Information subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so. In case DatasheetArchive is required to retain your Personal Information for legal reasons your Personal Information will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law. However, any withdrawal has no effect on past processing of Personal Information by DatasheetArchive up to the point in time of your withdrawal.
