What our clients are saying
“Cryoport does an amazing job of handling the shipping and logistics for transporting cryopreserved materials. We have switched to them for all of our exports.”
Bioengineering Core Employee – Cryoport Customer
“As a customer I'm very pleased with the service I received from Cryoport. Cryoport’s team always answered my questions, provided help in a professional manner and were extremely attentive.”
Cryoport Customer
“Had I known how great Cryoport’s dry vapor shipper and logistics system worked, we would have used Cryoport for all our previous shipments to the U.S. In the past we have used dry ice and several times we lost valuable cells because our shipments would sit in customs forever and the dry ice would evaporate. Cryoport eliminated that concern altogether. I will certainly be utilizing Cryoport’s services for future shipments.”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer
“By using Cryoport I experienced much less stress as my shipment went through customs!”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer
“I called Cryoport after hours for information about a shipment I needed to schedule and received absolutely outstanding customer service. Cryoport provided me with a lot of helpful information and great advice. It's rare and refreshing to receive such great service.”
Cryoport Customer
“Not only did my cells arrive safely, Cryoport’s service was professional and efficient. I highly recommend Cryoport.”
Hematologist – Cryoport Customer
“Working with Cryoport was a truly remarkable difference compared to my experience with other shippers. With the previous shipping company I was working with, it took almost three months to establish a ‘deep frozen account’ and required numerous hoop-jumping shenanigans only to ultimately be informed that the company could not arrange a shipment to or from Israel, which they were informed from the start was our desired shipping source.
Our sales rep at this organization was as dumbfounded by our experience as we were. To his credit, after his company declined our business, he suggested I contact Cryoport. I have written thanking him for his suggestion and to let his ‘powers-that-be’ know how different my experiences were.”
Cryoport Biopharma Customer
“When compared to other shippers, I am highly satisfied with Cryoport’s pricing and service.”
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer
“Our organization is more than impressed by our experience with Cryoport. We feel confident our material is being well-managed throughout transit. Cryoport provides extraordinary customer service and continuously they not only meet, but exceed our expectations. Late yesterday afternoon Cryoport worked tirelessly to coordinate a shipment to Japan and today seemed to effortlessly manage a late-day return. It is a pleasure working with Cryoport.”
Senior Supply Chain Analyst – Cryoport Customer
“Cryoport’s service is easy, straightforward and very convenient. We used to run into issues with transporting specimens to outside labs and Cryoport has eliminated this hurdle. Knowing Cryoport has it handled helps me sleep at night.”
Professor of Anatomy, Histology and Cell Biology – Cryoport Customer
“I'd like to commend Cryoport for their fantastic service. Our collaborator was also similarly impressed and will be recommending Cryoport to her colleagues. In addition to the great service and quality product, Cryoport’s pricing is second to none. We look forward to working with Cryoport for all of our future temperature-sensitive shipments."
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer
"I want to thank everyone at Cryoport who was involved in the rapid recovery of the missing Cryoport shipper containing a patient’s tumor tissue. By promptly locating the shipper and recharging it while in transit, the patient was able to receive the vaccine manufactured from this tissue on time. We are so very appreciative of Cryoport’s customer service. Without the services that Cryoport provides, our clinical trials would not be available to patients."
Director of Clinical Operations — Cryoport Customer
“Cryoport provides a reliable solution to ship temperature-sensitive biologics around the world. The Cryoport solution is easy for scientists to use. They respond quickly, have great customer service and anticipate problems. I am able to speak to someone 24/7 who is an expert on MY package. It is personal service focused on deep frozen life sciences. I consider Cryoport to be an extended member of my team.”
