Warranty Policy
Harvard Apparatus provides a two-year warranty on all Harvard Apparatus brand syringe pumps and VentElite ventilators based on date of purchase. All other products manufactured or supplied by Harvard Apparatus are provided a one year warranty based on
date of purchase, unless otherwise stated. At its option, Harvard Apparatus will repair or replace the unit if it is found to be defective as to workmanship or materials. This warranty does not extend to damage resulting from misuse, neglect or abuse,
normal wear and tear, or accident. This warranty extends only to the original consumer purchaser.
IN NO EVENT SHALL HARVARD APPARATUS BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. THERE ARE NO
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR OF ANY OTHER NATURE. Some states do not allow this limitation on an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
If a defect arises within the warranty period, promptly contact Harvard Apparatus, 84 October Hill Road, Holliston, Massachusetts 01746 using our toll free number 1–800–272–2775, or outside the U.S. call 508-893-8999. Our E-mail address is support@hbiosci.com.
Goods will not be accepted for return unless an RMA (returned materials authorization) number has been issued.
The customer is responsible for shipping charges. Please allow a reasonable period of time for completion of repairs or replacement. If the unit is replaced, the replacement unit is covered only for the remainder of the original warranty period dating
from the purchase of the original device. This warranty gives you specific rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
