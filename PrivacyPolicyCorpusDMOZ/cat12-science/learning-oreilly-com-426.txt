for computers and networks. After all, to damage a computer, an
attacker must have access. So in theory, to operate a secure system,
all you need to do is to block all of the venues by which an
attacker can get access, and the resulting system will be
secure.In practice, however, it has proved nearly impossible to have
a computer that offers services over the network and yet still
denies all access to attackers. Often access comes through
unintended holes, such as a carelessly coded CGI script (see Chapter 16), or a buffer overflow
attack that is known to the attacker but not the computer’s
operators.Instead of approaching host security as a laundry list of
specific technical action items, it’s better to look at the kinds of
practices that make computers less secure, and then explore the
specific policy initiatives that you can implement to improve your
security outlook.For more than a decade, there have been nine widespread
practices on the Internet that make host security far worse than it
needs to be. These practices are:Failure to think about security as a fundamental aspect of
