Other Code Signing Methods
To close this chapter, we note that there are other ways
of signing code to make it trustworthy. For example, for many years,
PGP signature certificates have been used for validating programs and
announcements distributed over the Internet. There are a few drawbacks
to using PGP in this way. Because support for PGP is not built into
web servers and browsers, the signature signing and verification must
be done as a two-step process. A second drawback is that PGP
signatures cannot use the public key infrastructure developed for use
with web browsers. A benefit of the use of PGP is that any kind of
file, document, or program can be signed with PGP, as PGP signatures
can be “detached” and saved in separate locations.As another alternative, the World Wide Web Consortium’s DSig
initiative has proposed using PICS 1.1 labels as a tool for digital
signatures. Information can be found at http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Security/DSig/Overview.html.
