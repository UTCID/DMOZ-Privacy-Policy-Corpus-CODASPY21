Privacy Policy
Effective: August 1, 2019
This website is developed and maintained by Carnegie Learning, Inc. (hereinafter “Carnegie Learning,” “we” or “us”).  This Privacy Policy communicates our Privacy practices to parents, teachers, and schools and school district administrators, collectively “you,” who license our products and services for either your own use or the use of your students.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By continuing to interact with our digital properties, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy on behalf of yourself and your students.
When you visit our website, or use our software or mobile applications (“apps,”) collectively our “digital properties,” Carnegie Learning may collect and use certain information about you and your students.  Carnegie Learning recognizes that you care about how your information, and the information of your students, is used.  This Privacy Policy explains how we may collect and use your and your student’s information, particularly personal information, and the choices you can make about what information about you and your students is shared.
This Privacy Policy applies to carnegielearning.com, longlivemath.com, emcl.com, emcschool.com and associated domains and subdomains, our software and apps, and covers information collected in connection with access and use of our digital properties. This Privacy Policy applies whether access or use of the digital properties is via personal computer, mobile device, or otherwise and to interactive features or downloads that are owned and operated by Carnegie Learning and its subsidiaries and that are available through the digital properties.
PLEASE NOTE: While most Carnegie Learning websites are general audience websites through which we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (“Children” and each, a “Child”), portions of the websites, certain subdomains, our software, and our apps are directed to children under 13. These subdomains, software, and apps contain teaching and learning resources designed for students in pre-K through college.  Students may access those digital properties directed to children only after their teacher or school or school district administrator has entered into a license with Carnegie Learning and has provided the students with access. The subdomains, software, and apps that are directed to children will follow our Children’s Privacy Policy.  In addition, our use of student information is described in Section 7. How Does Carnegie Learning Handle Student Information.
1.  Changes to this Privacy Policy
We ask that you periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will state its effective date, which is the most recent date on which we revised the Policy. Carnegie Learning reserves the right to make immaterial changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect Carnegie Learning’s use of a user’s personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on the our digital properties. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase our rights to use personal information we have previously collected about you, we will obtain your consent for those changes, as they relate both to your information, and to your students’ information, either through an email to your registered email address, or by prominent posting on our digital properties. If such changes occur, you will be asked to consent to these changes before continuing use of relevant digital properties.
2. Information Collected by Carnegie Learning, Inc.

7. How Does Carnegie Learning Handle Student Information?
Carnegie Learning is committed to protecting information about all of its customers. As part of this commitment, we work with educational institutions that must comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and state laws to help ensure student education record data is handled in a manner consistent with the applicable educational institution’s privacy policy.

We collect student information through our digital properties that provide teaching and learning resources designed for students in pre-K through college including, but not limited to, MyCL, MATHia, MATHiaU, Zulama, Passport, MyPL, Bookshelf and digital applications and materials available through these products and our websites.

In order to provide and support our products, Carnegie Learning may contract with third parties and share information required to carry out these services with these third parties. In such cases, all third parties are required to abide by this policy.
In some cases, the teachers, and schools and school district administrators who license our products and services enter into additional reporting or research agreements for the provision of reports or analyses that require data to be associated with demographic categories (gender, ethnicity, free or reduced lunch status, etc.) or other individual student information, such as test scores. In such cases, the teachers, schools and/or school district administrators provide Carnegie Learning and specified partners with the information required, which may personally identify students. When such agreements are in place, reports containing student information are provided only to the teachers, schools and school district administrators authorized to receive that information. In such cases, data is held securely and only Carnegie Learning employees and partners directly involved in producing these reports have access to students’ personally identifiable information.
Carnegie Learning does not collect or maintain any demographic, academic or other school record information about students, teachers or administrators unless it has a separate reporting or research agreement.
We may have different contractual terms and privacy policies in place with some of our customers. Those other terms and policies may amend this Policy for information collected or released under those terms, but they will never contradict the policy terms described here. If you have any questions as to what legal agreement or privacy policy controls the collection and use of your information, please contact your school district or Carnegie Learning at privacy@carnegielearning.com.
8.  Use of Data for Research
Carnegie Learning uses de-identified and aggregate data about students’ use of our digital properties for product development, research or other purposes. To de-identify data, we remove all direct and indirect personal identifiers. These identifiers include, but are not limited to, name, ID number, teacher name, class and school identifications. Carnegie Learning agrees not to attempt to re-identify any de-identified data. We may store de-identified data indefinitely.
Schools, school districts and individuals may ask for their data to be excluded from any de-identified data sets. To request such exclusion, please email privacy@carnegielearning.com.
In addition, for research and other purposes, Carnegie Learning may transfer de-identified data to third parties.  For example, we may share information such as problems attempted, answers or hint requests for each step of the problem, and associated time stamps. We review all requests for such de-identified data sets, and we require all recipients of de-identified data sets to agree to the Carnegie Learning Private Dataset Terms of Use, which prohibit, among other things, any attempts to re-identify the de-identified data and any commercial use of the data.
In connection with research studies, Carnegie Learning and/or its partners may publish or discuss aggregate data about student performance and results. Such publications never reference individual information, only aggregate statistics. Research projects that make use of student data are reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) which is responsible for approving the goals and procedures of the study, including those related to maintaining privacy of information. The IRB may or may not require parental or student notification or approval. Schools or school districts provide prior consent to any research that involves interaction with the schools and their students’ information. Carnegie Learning is committed to abiding by IRB recommendations and requirements.
As part of our commitment to continual improvement, Carnegie Learning may field test new application content and features within our products. We may also partner with third-party researchers to conduct such research. If the research is not exempt from IRB review, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review the goals and procedures of the study, including those related to maintaining privacy of information.
9. How Does Carnegie Learning Protect My Information?
Carnegie Learning has implemented an information security program with numerous measures, including administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard information that can individually identify you against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.
Data Retention, Access, and Security
At the end of each school year or upon termination of the district contract, Carnegie Learning will notify school districts that all personally-identifiable student data in its possession or in the possession of any subcontractors or agents to which we may have transferred the information will be either destroyed or de-identified. Districts may request a copy of the data or that we retain the data on their behalf by emailing their request to privacy@carnegielearning.com within 60 days of such notification.
