What Types of Information and Data Does Kuder Collect, and When Does It Collect This Data?
Kuder collects various types of Personal Information. We collect this information when you provide it to us (whether directly or through our subsidiaries and/or representatives) or when you use certain services provided by Kuder.
"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify, locate, or contact you as a natural person, as well as other information about you that we tie to Personal Information. Personal Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information:
"Contact Information" that allows us to identify and communicate with you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and language preferences.
"Relationship Information" that helps us understand who you are what you want in order to offer you products and services that may interest you, such as demographics such as, race gender, age, household income, grade level, school at which you are enrolled or other organization with which you are affiliated, and other psychographics such information relating to your career planning preferences, interest, or assessments.
"Transactional Information" about how you interact with us, our subsidiaries and Sponsoring Organizations, including services you request, customer service inquiries, and customer account information.
“Non-Personal Information” is any information that does not identify a natural person and is not identifiable to a natural person, such as:
Cookies and other tools used in a non-identifiable way;
Anonymized information;
Aggregated information; and
Information about your business operations, including, but not limited to:
Operation-specific data, such as location data, when kept in a non-identifiable way; and
The name, form, and contact details of legal persons.
In addition to the methods described above, Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be collected by Kuder from its subsidiaries and authorized Sponsoring Organizations as part of its standard business operations, to provide services to the subsidiaries and authorized sponsoring organizations, and as otherwise agreed pursuant to agreements between Kuder and such subsidiaries and authorized Sponsoring Organizations.
When data is described as “anonymized,” it means that the data is no longer associated with a particular person.  When data is described as “aggregated,” it means that such information has been combined with other data in such a way that no person can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.

How Kuder Uses Your Information (the "Purposes")
Subject to the limitations and other rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, Kuder uses your Personal Information in its identifiable form for a variety of purposes, including:
To Complete Orders and Provide Requested Services. To fulfill orders for products or services, and for other services or purposes as you may request or direct, such as product delivery, maintenance, and the like.
Product and Customer Support. To provide support services, to deliver upgrades and product improvement communications.
Marketing and Surveys. To communicate offers for products, building content, and services from Kuder or its subsidiaries, dealers, suppliers, partners, or authorized sponsoring organizations, including offers based on your demographics and psychographics, interests, personal and business characteristics and your location; to administer surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contest, loyalty programs and other promotional events; and to provide other information which may be of interest to you, such as Kuder company news, catalogs, announcements, reminders, and technical bulletins. Please contact us if you would not like to be contacted by Kuder for marketing purposes without being asked.  We will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of marketing information or market research inquiries.
General Business Purposes. To provide and accomplish standard business tasks, such as payment processing, financial account management, product development, contract management, website administration, web-forum management, order or contract fulfillment, analytics, fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.
As Disclosed at the Time of Collection. In any other manner that we may describe when you provide the information to us.
These Purposes may be necessary for Kuder to perform a contract to which you are a party, comply with a legal obligation to which Kuder is subject, protect Kuder’s vital interests or the interests of another natural person, or otherwise pursue Kuder’s legitimate business purposes and objectives.  Kuder may obtain your consent to process your Personal Information, as necessary.
Kuder collects Non-Personal Information in the same ways it collects Personal Information, described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, Kuder may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some instances, Kuder may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your location data). If Kuder combines any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, Kuder will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
In addition, Kuder reserves the right to use anonymized and aggregated Personal Information to improve its products and services, to create and publish reports, to conduct statistical analysis about our customers and products, and for other activities that do not result in the disclosure of your identifiable information.

When Will Kuder Disclose Your Information, and Who May Receive It?

In order to fulfill the purposes of products and services, we may disclose and make accessible to a Sponsoring Organization and its affiliates in accordance with the terms of an agreement between Kuder and such Sponsoring Organization.
We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries, Sponsoring Organizations,  and business partners, as needed to accomplish, and consistently with, the Purposes set forth above, or as you authorize or request.
We may also share Personal Information with our service providers to fulfill the Purposes on our behalf. Our service providers are bound by law or contract to treat your information and data with the same level of protection that we do and to only use it in accordance with our instructions.
We may disclose Personal Information where needed to affect the sale or transfer of business assets, to enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property, or safety of others, or as needed to support external auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
We will also disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the countries where we operate.
As noted above, Kuder reserves the right to use and disclose anonymized and aggregated Personal Information to improve its products and services, to create and publish reports, to conduct statistical analysis about our customers and products, and for other activities that do not result in the disclosure of your identifiable information.

Website Data Collection, Cookies, and Similar Technology
When you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons.
For example, when you visit our website, we may place cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. We may also use Adobe Flash Cookies, Microsoft Silverlight, and similar technologies which remember your settings, preferences, and usage in a manner similar to browser cookies to personalize and enhance your online experience, but which are not managed through your browser. To manage your Flash and Silverlight cookies, please see Adobe’s and Microsoft’s websites.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure the response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also may record the IP address or derivative of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Kuder and the website you visit after you leave our site.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without reference to Personal Information. For example, we use the information we collect about website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information. Additionally, if the settings on your geo-aware mobile devices permit our mobile applications to collect location information, we will collect that information automatically. This Privacy Policy governs how we use all of this information when we associate it with your Personal Information.

To opt-out of marketing emails, you can visit our website and communicate your choice to the relevant privacy contact. Alternatively, you may opt-out of receiving future marketing emails by clicking "unsubscribe" at the bottom of marketing emails we send you.
Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing material, we may still need to contact you with important Transactional Information about your account or your products. For example, even if you opt-out of marketing emails, we will still send you a confirmation when you purchase something from us as well as to provide communications related to our products.

In general, Kuder complies and requests that all of its service providers comply with your “Do Not Track” settings you select using your internet browser(s).

The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), particularly Articles 15 to 21, affords an EU resident, a number of rights as a data subject.  If you are an EU resident, Kuder encourages you to read and learn about those rights on your own.  However, the following will help you to begin to understand those rights afforded to EU residents.
The Right to Access: This allows you to request from Kuder information about your Personal Information, including what data Kuder has and how and why it is being processed.
The Right to Rectification: In the event that some or all of the Personal Information that Kuder has concerning you is inaccurate, this gives you the right to have those inaccuracies rectified.
The Right to Erasure: In some cases, you may have the right to request that Kuder erase your Personal Information that it has in its possession.
The Right to Restriction of Processing: This gives you the right, in some circumstances, to have Kuder process your Personal Information only with your consent.
The Right to Object to Processing: Where Kuder is processing your Personal Information on the ground of its legitimate interests, or to carry out tasks in the public interest or to exercise official authority, you have a right to object to the processing on grounds relating to your particular situation. In cases where you object to Kuder’s processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, the processing will cease.
The Right to Data Portability: This allows you to request from Kuder a copy of your Personal Information that it has on file and to transfer that information to someone else without any interference from Kuder.  In some cases, you may be able to request that Kuder transfer your Personal Information directly to a third party on your behalf.
In addition, to the extent that Kuder processes any of your Personal Information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing that was based on your consent before its withdrawal.
If you are a natural person residing in the EU and at any time you believe Kuder has violated one of your rights listed above, or if you believe Kuder is in violation of one or more of the provisions of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority.  More information about the Data Protection Authorities can be found at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-are-data-protection-authorities-dpas_en.
