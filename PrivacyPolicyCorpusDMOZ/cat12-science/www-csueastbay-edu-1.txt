b. General health data, information which is used by the University in making a decision regarding the student's status, is subject to review by the student under this policy. Written medical, psychiatric, and psychological case notes which form the basis for diagnosis or for recommendation of treatment plans remain privileged information not accessible to the student. Such case notes are not considered to be part of the University's official education records. (These records may be personally reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student's choosing.)III. POLICY GOVERNING PROCEDURES FOR INSPECTION AND REVIEWStudents who wish to inspect and review their education records may do so by submitting a written request to the official responsible for the specific record desired. The responsible official must respond with 45 days of the request by arranging an appointment for the student to review the requested data.
Copies of education records or record entries, with certain exceptions, may be obtained by the student at the established rate. Copies of a student's permanent academic record (transcript) will be provided at the established charge. The University reserves the right to deny a copy of an education record for which a financial registration, disciplinary or other university "hold" exists, or of an exam or set of standardized test questions, or of a transcription or image of an original source document which exists elsewhere.
The University will not permit access to or release of any personally identifiable information without the written consent of the student except in the following circumstances:
A student's education records may be released without consent to officials within the University with "legitimate educational interest" in such information. "School officials" are University employees with general or specific responsibility for promoting the educational objectives of the University. Employees whose responsibilities place them within this category may include: faculty advisors, admissions counselors, academic advisors, counselors, placement personnel, deans, department heads, directors, and other administrative officials responsible for some part of the academic enterprise or one of the supporting activities, and clerical personnel employed to assist University officials in discharging professional responsibilities. "School officials" include persons employed by or under contract to the University to perform a specific task, such as an attorney or auditor. A student who is serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or who is assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks is also a "School Official". Access by these officials is restricted where practical only to students for whom they have professional responsibility and only to that portion of the student record necessary for the discharge of assigned duties.
"Legitimate educational interests" are defined as those interests that are essential to the general process of higher education prescribed by the body of policy adopted by the Board of Trustees. Legitimate educational interests would include teaching, research, public service, and such directly supportive activities as academic advising, career counseling, discipline, financial assistance and advisement, medical services, and academic assistance activities.

This record of request must identify the legitimate interest the person(s) had in seeking or obtaining information contained in a record and may be available for inspection by the student identified by the record.
IV. POLICY GOVERNING PROCEDURES FOR CHALLENGING THE CONTENTS OF AN EDUCATIONAL RECORDA student may challenge the contents of an education record which they consider to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of their privacy rights. Students may initiate a challenge by submitting a written request to the custodian of the particular record in question who shall attempt to resolve the problem through informal discussions. If a challenge to a record is not satisfactorily resolved by this procedure, the student will be informed of their right to a formal hearing, the procedures to be followed concerning such a hearing, and its composition. A student requesting a hearing will be notified in writing of the date, place, and time of their hearing.
The hearing board will consist of individuals who are disinterested parties but who may be university officials. The decisions of the hearing board will be communicated to the student. Decisions of the hearing panel are final. If decisions of the hearing board are unsatisfactory to the student, the student may place in the education record a statement commenting on the information contained in the record and setting forth any reason for disagreeing with the decision of the hearing panel. If the university discloses the contested portion of the record, it must also disclose the student's statement.
