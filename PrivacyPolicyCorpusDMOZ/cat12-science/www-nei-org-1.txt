We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, that may track details about your online activities over time and across different sites. These services provide demographic and user profiling information, and help us to improve our website and outreach services. These analytics tools and services may also allow us and others to provide you with targeted advertisements or other content that you may be interested in based on your online activities. You can learn more about Google Analytics and privacy here and your choices about Google ad settings here.
Personal Information: Personal information that you voluntarily disclose to NEI either online or in writing through publication order forms, meeting registration forms, survey response forms, service enrollment or registration forms, or e-mail sent to NEI, is added to the relevant NEI database to enable our processing of orders or registration, to update our databases, to enable us to make appropriate responses, and to allow us to analyze and improve our efforts. This information usually includes name, e-mail and/or physical address, item or service purchased or requested, meeting attended, or topic of interest, and may include credit card data if you place an order online.
