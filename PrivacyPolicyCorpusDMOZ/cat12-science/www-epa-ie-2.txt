Where you upload personal data to any of the Websites, with respect to which both you and the EPA determine the means and purposes of processing as joint controllers, both you and the EPA shall be individually responsible, as a sole data controller, for its own processing of personal data pursuant to and/or in connection with the use of such Website.

You and the EPA should aim for full compliance with the Regulatory Requirements and must provide reasonable recourses to its employees to enable processing of personal data in compliance with the Regulatory Requirements.
Where you upload personal data to any of the Websites it is your responsibility to ensure that you have a proper legal basis under GDPR for doing so.  Where you upload such personal data you shall ensure that the EPA Privacy Policy is brought to the attention of any affected individuals.
You and the EPA shall inform the other of any requests from data subjects regarding rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction or objection of the processing of personal data that is relevant for the other party. You and the EPA shall, to the extent that such a request affects the other Party's processing of personal data, comply with all such requests in accordance with the Regulatory Requirements.
You and the EPA shall inform the other immediately if it becomes aware of, or suspects a personal data breach which is likely to affect or invoke the other party's obligations under the Regulatory Requirements. The notifying party shall document all personal data breaches in accordance with the Regulatory Requirements and fully cooperate with the other party to ensure compliance with the Regulatory Requirements. Both parties shall use reasonable endeavours to mitigate any damage suffered by a data subject.

This, however, shall not prevent the EPA from pursuing a claim for breach of contract, copyright infringement or otherwise in respect of these Terms or the Websites in any other jurisdiction.
