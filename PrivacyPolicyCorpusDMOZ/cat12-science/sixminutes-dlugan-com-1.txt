We will never share your email address or any other personal details with anyone!
Our motivation is only to create the best public speaking resource that we can, and to continue to grow the number of readers and subscribers.
What Information Do We Collect?
Compared with many other websites, Six Minutes collects relatively little data about you, the reader.
Here’s what we capture and how we use it.
1. Page Views
Like practically every website on the planet, Six Minutes records each time a page is viewed on this website.
What is collected?
Anonymous data is collected about which page was viewed at what time and what day. No attempt is ever made to trace backwards to determine exactly who viewed a page when. This anonymous data also includes standard details such as the type of web browser you use or the screen size.
What does this data tell us?
This data fuels reports such as: “Which articles were read 1000 times this week?” or “How many people have read How to Improve Your Slides with the Rule of Thirds since it was published?”
Why does this help us?
Knowing which articles are popular helps us improve Six Minutes by writing articles which people want to read.
Knowing which devices people use helps us improve the site design for Six Minutes by optimizing for those screen sizes or browser types.
How is this collected?
This information is collected by web server logs and by a third party analytics tool (Google Analytics).
What is Shared?
None of this data is shared with anyone.
2. Article Comments
Like most websites, Six Minutes encourages feedback from readers in the form of comments.
What is collected?
When you leave a comment on an article, you must provide your name and email address. You can optionally provide your website URL.
What does this data tell us?
It allows us to follow-up on your comment (if appropriate) by emailing you.
Why does this help us?
Comments improve Six Minutes by offering more diverse opinions on public speaking topics.
What is Shared?
Your comment, your name, and your website URL (if you provided one) are shown to anyone viewing the article.
Your email address is never shared with anyone.
3. Subscribers by Email
Six Minutes provides a convenient way to have new articles emailed directly to you using a third-party service (Google Feedburner).
What is collected?
To sign up for this service, you must obviously provide your email address.
Why does this help us?
It allows us to send you an email when new articles are published. That’s it!
What is Shared?
Your email address is never shared with anyone.
4. Subscribers by RSS
Six Minutes can also be subscribed to via an RSS feed.
What is collected?
No personal information is collected. Only an aggregate total of how many people are subscribed through an RSS Reader is available.
Why does this help us?
Knowing we have thousands of subscribers is good for our ego, but that’s about it.
What is Shared?
The total number of subscribers is shared on the website.
Comments are closed.
