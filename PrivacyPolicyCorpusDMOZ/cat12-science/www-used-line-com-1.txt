Create and Follow your Wishlist
The convenience of the Used-Line Wishlist
Not only can you add single products that interest you to the Used-Line Wishlist, but you can also add specific lists of products and receive updates at intervals chosen by you whenever changes are made to your lists. As well, you can enter a search term into your Wishlist and receive updates whenever a change that matches your search term occurs on the website.
Long lists and the Used-Line Wishlist
It is hard to imagine how a long list of products, such as a list of all products of a particular brand, or all products belonging to a particular Used-Line category, can fit into a small Wishlist container. But on Used-Line, this is indeed possible and very manageable.
For your convenience, each list takes up only a single row in your Wishlist, and you will be updated whenever there is a change anywhere in any of your lists, no matter how many items the lists actually contain. This way you can follow any changes that take place in your lists.
Adding single products to the Used-Line Wishlist
To add an item to the Wishlist:
Browse or search for any products you wish to view in Equipment Listings
Click Add to Wishlist to add an item to your wishlist. You can add an item from the page it is listed on or from the actual ad when you open the listing.
View your Wishlist items by choosing Wishlist at the top of any page on Used-Line, and selecting the Item tab.

If you wish, you can select another model number to follow, using the same or a different interval, or you can select a Dealer, Manufacturer, or Category list to follow.

If you wish, you can select another category to follow using the same or a different time interval, or you can select a Model, Dealer, or Manufacturer to follow.
Adding a search you made from inside your Wishlist
If you don’t find what you are looking for when you make a search on Used-Line, you can enter your search term into your Wishlist and be notified when updates are made on the website that match your search term. This can be helpful if you are looking for recent additions to the equipment market, or are searching for rare pieces of equipment.
To keep track of products based on a search term of your choice:
Click Wishlist in the top right side of any page on Used-Line.
Choose Search.
In the Type search box, type the term that you want to base your search on.
