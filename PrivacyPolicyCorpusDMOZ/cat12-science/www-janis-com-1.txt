If the Purchaser fails to perform its obligations under the OT&V sale and service agreement, Lake Shore shall be permitted to charge the Purchaser for Lake Shore’s personnel costs due to the Purchaser’s failure.Upon completion of Purchaser’s OT&V, Lake Shore may issue and Purchaser shall review and, if accurate, sign an “Acceptance of Product Certificate,” (the Acceptance) within 10 days after the OT&V.
