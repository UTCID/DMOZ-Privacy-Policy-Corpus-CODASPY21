Your Privacy and SCI
When you place an order with SCI, we'll add your name
and address to our file, which is off-line (not connected to the net) in
SCI's office. And that's where it will stay! We don't sell, or give away,
or otherwise let out, any address lists, e-mail lists, or any other
information about customers. We don't keep your credit card number or
telephone number for more than about a month -- long enough to reasonably
assume that you have received your order, and that you don't want to return
it for credit. Then that information is simply erased. And so is your
e-mail address.
When we have a new product to announce, which has, unfortunately, been rare, we might use the address file, and send you a postcard or flier by first-class mail to tell you about it.
If you'd prefer that we remove your name and address from even the off-line
address file, and not send any U.S. Mail announcements, we'll be happy to
do that. Or, if you wish to change the address information we have on file
for you, let us know. Just send us a message
and state your request.
No cookies, either. If you've explored the web a
little, you've probably found sites that want to "set a cookie" on your computer.
Sometimes they want to set several. Then when you return to that site later, they reach into your "cookie jar" on your computer and retrieve information about you. Well, that might be OK for companies who need to tailor product offerings to your preferences. But SCI's products are few in number, and we just don't need (or choose) to keep your browsing habits on file. In short, we're not collecting any information from you, or about you, in any way, when you browse or use our web site.
Shopping online with SCI is 100% SAFE.
If you choose to order from SCI online, we use a secure "ShopSite" web server to
handle the order form, and all the information you enter onto it is
encrypted, so that eavesdroppers on the internet won't be able to obtain
your address, telephone number, or credit card number. Only SCI will see
this data intact, and we will treat it exactly as described above.
But you don't even have to trust the system. We offer an offline order form, which you can print, and mail in with a check -- or fax it with credit card information.
You have my promise that SCI will value and respect your privacy, as we
have been doing ever since we started offering mail order service in
1987.
