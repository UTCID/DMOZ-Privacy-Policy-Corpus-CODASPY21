ConclusionWriting secure web applications is a difficult task. Any program
that runs on your web server can potentially compromise the security
of the entire system. To make things worse, no amount of testing will
tell you if your programs are error-free. The solution to this
apparent dilemma is to follow strict rules when writing your own
programs and then to have those scripts carefully evaluated by someone
you trust. Good luck!
