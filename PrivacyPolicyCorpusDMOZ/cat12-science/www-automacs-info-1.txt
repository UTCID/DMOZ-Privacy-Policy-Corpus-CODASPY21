Fully automated cell isolation for walk-away convenience
Automated cell isolation with the autoMACS® Pro Separator provides fast and gentle isolation of virtually any cell type. Cells can be automatically isolated even directly from whole blood or bone marrow, which makes it ideal for multiple myeloma research or lineage-specific chimerism analysis. With true walk-away automated cell separation, reproducible and user-independent results are certain.  Proven in over 2,300 peer-reviewed publications, the autoMACS Pro is the most trusted automated magnetic cell separation technology.
Watch how cell isolation on the autoMACS® Pro Separator works
With the autoMACS® Pro Separator, cells from whole blood or bone marrow can be isolated with minimal hands-on time. See how your target cells are being separated directly from whole blood samples without the need for density gradient centrifugation or red blood cell lysis.
