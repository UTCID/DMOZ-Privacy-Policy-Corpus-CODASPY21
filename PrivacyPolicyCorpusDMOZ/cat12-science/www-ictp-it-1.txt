Users’ Personal Information, registered or not, may be collected by cookies.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to the user's terminal equipment by visited websites; they are stored in the user's terminal equipment to be then re-transmitted to the websites on the user's subsequent visits to those websites.

Analytical Cookies allow to recognize and collect aggregate information on the number of visitors and the pattern of visits to the website. Analytical cookies are assimilated to technical cookies and are used directly by the website first party to improve their usability.
Profiling Cookies are aimed at creating user profiles and they are used to send advertising messages to the user’s device, in line with the preferences shown by the user during navigation. Because of the highly invasive nature of these cookies in the user’s private sphere, Italian and European legislation requires users to be informed appropriately on their use so as to give their valid consent.
Pursuant to article 122 of the Privacy Code (Personal Data Protection Code), data subject’s consent for technical cookies is not required, but this policy is sufficient  as their use is limited to the technical storage or the access to already stored information, in fact technical cookies are used exclusively with a view to "carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic communications network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said service."
