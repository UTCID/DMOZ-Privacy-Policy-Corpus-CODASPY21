We reserve the right, at our discretion, to amend this Agreement at any time and without notice. If we do this, we will post the amended Agreement on this page and indicate at the top of the page the date the Agreement was last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

Use of our service
The Ayrstone AyrMesh system provides a way for you to create a Wireless LAN (WLAN) across your entire homestead, as well as services to increase the value of that network.
To access the features of the Service, though, such as managing your network, you will need to register with Ayrstone and create a “Member” account on Ayrmesh.com. Your Member account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Members. If you open a Member account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity (a “Subscribing Organization”), then:
“you” includes you and that Subscribing Organization, and
you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the Subscribing Organization with the authority to bind such Subscribing Organization to this Agreement, and that you have read the terms of and agree to this Agreement on the Subscribing Organization’s behalf.
You may never use another Member’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate, true, current and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Ayrstone immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Ayrstone will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, and you may be liable for the losses incurred by Ayrstone or others due to any unauthorized use of your account.

General
A. Governing Law. You agree that:
the Service shall be deemed solely based in Minnesota; and
the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Ayrstone Productivity LLC, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Minnesota.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any claim or dispute between you and Ayrstone Productivity LLC that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Minnesota, unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph.
B. Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:
the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration;
