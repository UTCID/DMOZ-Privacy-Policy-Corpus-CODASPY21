About This BookThis is a book about how to enhance security, privacy, and
commerce on the World Wide Web. Information in this book is aimed at
three distinct but related audiences: the ordinary users of the Web, the
individuals who operate the Web’s infrastructure (web servers, hosts,
routers, and long-distance data communications links), and finally, the
people who publish information on the Web.For users, this book explains:How the Web worksThe threats to your privacy and your computer that await you
on the WebHow you can protect yourself against these threatsHow encryption works, and why a web server that you access
might demand that you use this techniqueFor people who are operating the Web’s infrastructure, this book
discusses:How to lessen the chances that your server will be
compromisedHow you can use encryption to protect your data and your web
site’s visitorsSelected legal issuesFor web content providers, this book discusses:The risks and threats facing your dataHow to control access to information on your web serverProcedures that you should institute so you can recover
quickly if your server is compromisedSecurity issues arising from the use of Java, JavaScript,
ActiveX, and Netscape plug-insThis book covers the fundamentals of web security, but it is not
designed to be a primer on computer security, operating systems, or the
World Wide Web. For that, we have many recommendations.Some especially good O’Reilly books on security- and
web-related topics include the following: Æleen Frisch’s
Essential System Administration, Chuck Musciano and
Bill Kennedy’s HTML & XHTML: The Definitive
Guide, Shishir Gundavaram’s CGI Programming on the World Wide Web, Elizabeth Zwicky, Simon Cooper, and Brent
Chapman’s Building Internet Firewalls, and
finally our own book, Practical Unix & Internet Security.We also have some recommendations for books from other publishers.
For in-depth information on cryptography, we heartily recommend Bruce
Schneier’s excellent book Applied Cryptography. For
detailed information on configuring the Apache web server, we recommend
Lincoln Stein’s Web Security. And for a general
overview of security engineering and practices, we recommend Ross
Anderson’s Security Engineering.These books and other helpful references are listed Appendix E.Organization of This BookThis book is divided into five parts; it includes 27 chapters
and 5 appendixes:Part I, examines the
underlying technology that makes up today’s World Wide Web and the
Internet in general.Chapter 1 examines the
basics of web security—the risks inherent in running a web server, in
using the Web to distribute information or services, and finally, the
risks of being a user on the Internet.Chapter 2 is a detailed
exploration of computers, communications links, and protocols that
make up the Web. It provides a technical introduction to the systems
that will be discussed throughout the rest of the book and that
underlie web security concepts.Chapter 3 introduces the
science and mathematics of cryptography, with a particular emphasis on
public key encryption.Chapter 4 specifically
looks at the encryption algorithms that are used on the Web
today.Chapter 5 looks more
closely at the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) system that are used by “secure” web servers.Chapter 6 introduces the
topic of authentication and gives an overview of several classes of
authentication systems in use on the Internet.Chapter 7 focuses on the
use of digital certificates for authentication and introduces
certification authorities (CAs) and the public key infrastructure
(PKI).Part II, looks at the
concerns of people using the Web to access information—that is,
anybody who runs a web browser.Chapter 8 discusses the
technical means by which personal information can be compromised on
the Web.Chapter 9 explores
techniques that you can follow to increase your privacy while using
the Web.Chapter 10 continues the
discussion of privacy self-help, by exploring programs and services
that can further enhance your privacy.Chapter 11 shows you how
to protect against data loss and theft of both data and
equipment.Chapter 12 explores how
programs that travel over the Web can threaten your computer system
and your personal information. This chapter focuses on the most
dangerous programs that can be downloaded with email or through web
pages.Chapter 13 continues the
discussion of mobile programs that can threaten computer users. This
chapter focuses on the “safer” technologies that, it turns out, still
have some security implications.Part III is addressed to
people and organizations that are operating servers attached to the
Internet. The chapters in this part focus on the mechanics of web
server operation. They are particularly relevant to corporations that
operate their own web servers, administrators at Internet service
providers (ISPs), and home users who run their own servers at the end
of cable modems or DSL lines.Chapter 14 addresses one
of the most important but frequently overlooked topics—how to protect
your computer’s physical well-being.Chapter 15 explores
security having to do with your computer’s operating system.Chapter 16 discusses the
added security issues that arise when running web servers that can
execute programs or scripts.Chapter 17 gives
step-by-step instructions for enabling SSL on the Apache and Internet
Information Services (IIS) web servers.Chapter 18 broadens the
security discussion to show how to defend your service against
problems resulting from your ISP or the Internet’s Domain Name Service
(DNS).Chapter 19 explores the
specific legal options available to you after your computer system has
been broken into, as well as other legal issues of concern to
administrators.Part IV focuses on issues
surrounding the content of the web server, rather than the mechanics
of the web server’s operation.Chapter 20 looks at
techniques for controlling information to “private” areas of your web
server.Chapter 21 expands on the
access control techniques described in Chapter 20 by discussing how you can
use digital certificates for access control and secure
messaging.Chapter 22 shows how you
can sign Windows binaries, including ActiveX controls and .EXE files, using Microsoft’s Authenticode
technology.Chapter 23 discusses the
politics and the technology of controlling pornography on the
Internet.Chapter 24 explores the
concept of data protection and discusses legislative and
self-regulatory techniques for controlling the use of personal
information.Chapter 25 is a how-to
guide for sending and receiving money over the Internet. For those
interested in e-commerce history, this chapter also discusses a number
of failed digital payment systems.Chapter 26 discusses
trademarks, copyright, and patents—all legal structures that can be
used to protect information.Part V, is filled with
lists and nitty-gritty technical information that is too detailed for
the main body of this book.Appendix A is a
first-person account of the first five years of operation of
Vineyard.NET, the oldest, largest, and currently only ISP that offers
service exclusively on Martha’s Vineyard.Appendix B contains more
detailed information about the SSL and TLS protocols. This chapter
won’t give you enough information to write your own SSL or TLS
implementation, but it will give you an understanding of what is
happening on the wire.Appendix C is a detailed
introduction to the P3P specification. This chapter, written by Lorrie
Faith Cranor and included with permission, includes information on how
to write your own P3P policy.Appendix D provides
detailed information on the PICS specification. Although PICS appears
largely dead today, an implementation is included in Microsoft’s
Internet Explorer, so PICS is still there for anybody who wants to use
it.Appendix E lists books,
articles, and web sites containing further helpful information about
web security, privacy, and commerce.What You Should KnowWeb security is a complex topic that touches on many aspects of
traditional computer security, computer architecture, system design,
software engineering, Internet technology, mathematics, and the law.
To keep the size of this book under control, we have focused on
conveying information and techniques that are not readily found
elsewhere.To get the most out of this book, you should already be familiar
with the operation and management of a networked computer. You should
know how to connect your computer to the Internet; how to obtain,
install, and maintain computer software; and how to perform routine
system management tasks, such as backups. You should have a working
knowledge of the World Wide Web, and know how to install and maintain
your organization’s web server.That is not to say that this is a book written solely for
“propeller-heads” and security geeks. Great effort has been made to
make this book useful for people who have a working familiarity with
computers and the Web, but who are not familiar with the nitty-gritty
details of computer security. That’s why we have included introductory
chapters on such topics as cryptography and SSL.Web Software Covered by This BookA major difficulty in writing a book on web security is that the
field moves incredibly quickly. Configuration information and screen
shots that look up-to-date one month seem antiquated and obsolete a
few months later. This is partially the result of the steady release
of new software versions, and the integration of new features into
commonly-used software. The difficulty in keeping current is
complicated by the steady drumbeat of warnings from vendors and
organizations such as SANS and CERT/CC, announcing a significant new
security vulnerability every few days—often caused by the vendors’
rush to deliver all those new features without carefully testing them
for security flaws!But in fact, the field of web security is not moving as fast as
it may seem. Although new vulnerabilities have been created and
discovered, the underlying concepts of web security have changed
little since the first edition of this book was published in the
spring of 1997. We have therefore refrained from updating all of our
screenshots and code examples simply to match the latest revisions of
Microsoft and Netscape’s offerings. If a point is well made by a
screenshot that featured an older version of a product, we have
generally opted to leave the screenshot in place.To avoid the planned obsolescence that seems to beset many
computer books, this book concentrates on teaching concepts and
principles, rather than specific sequences of commands and
keystrokes.In writing this book, we used a wide variety of software.
Examples in this book are drawn primarily from two web servers:ApacheApache is one of the most popular web servers
currently in use. Apache runs on a wide variety of computers,
including most versions of Unix and Windows NT. When combined
with the mod_ssl encryption module, Apache
can be the basis for creating an extremely sophisticated web
publishing system. Apache is freely available in both source
code and precompiled form; it is even preinstalled on many
computer systems.Microsoft Internet Information ServerIIS is Microsoft’s cryptographically enabled web
server that is bundled with the Windows NT Server and Windows
2000 operating systems.The following web browsers were used in the creation of this
book:Netscape NavigatorNetscape Navigator is the web browser that ignited
the commercialization of the Internet. Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, and
6 were used in the preparation of this book. Navigator is
available on a wide variety of computer platforms, including
various versions of Windows, Unix, Linux, and the
Macintosh.Microsoft Internet ExplorerThe Microsoft Internet Explorer is a cryptographically
enabled web browser that is deeply interconnected with the
Microsoft Windows operating system, and is also available for
Macintosh computers. Versions 3, 4, 5, and 6 were used in the
preparation of this book.OperaWe also used Opera Software’s browser, “the fastest browser on
earth.” Opera is available for BeOS, EPOC, Linux, Mac, OS/2, and
Windows.
