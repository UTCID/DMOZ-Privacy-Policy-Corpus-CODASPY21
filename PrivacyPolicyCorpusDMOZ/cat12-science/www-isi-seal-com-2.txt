MDC Security Policy
MDC Security PolicyOverview
MDC Precision, LLC realizes how important security is to you, so we’ve taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information provided to or from www.mdcprecision.com over the Internet. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. This is done anytime you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas.
Online Security
www.mdcprecision.com is a Network Solutions secured site using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology creates a private conversation that only the computer you are using andwww.mdcprecision.com (MDC Precision, LLC) systems can understand. The SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and MDC Precision, LLC systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential.
The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes a secure connection to MDC Precision, LLC server systems.
To learn more about Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ), follow this link : www.openssl.org.
The most popular browsers offer the ability to receive an alert or notification if you change between secure and unsecured transmission modes, or if you receive an invalid site identification notice from a site to which you are about to send a message over an "open" or unsecured connection.
Check the settings of your browser security features to see all the options that are available and those that are currently selected. The presence of security measures surrounding the entry of data on a web page is identified in two ways on your browser:
The URL identifying the page will always begin with "https://" versus the normal "http://"
Additional Security Measures
In addition to your browser internet security features, MDC Precision, LLC has incorporated its own series of measures designed to provide enhanced protection.
Firewalls
MDC Precision, LLC makes use of the latest technology to protect your stored information. We use firewalls at many levels to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing our system. All messages entering or leaving our system pass through these firewalls and are examined according to certain security criteria we have in place. If the defined criteria are not met, the message is blocked. A firewall is considered a first line of defense in protecting private information.
Virus Protection
Our systems are also protected by virus programs, which are kept current to the latest standards. These virus programs provide another layer of protection for our systems and our users.
Your Password
Choose a password that is at least six characters long. In general, a good password will have a mix of lower- and upper-case characters, numbers, and should be at least 6 characters long.
Email Confirmation
We will send you automatic email confirmation of your order. This is your assurance that we have received your transaction.
Limiting Employee Access
All MDC Precision, LLC employees are educated about the importance of security and confidentiality. Only those employees having a business reason for knowing such information have access to personally identifiable and sensitive information.
Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. To learn more please read MDC's Privacy Policy
