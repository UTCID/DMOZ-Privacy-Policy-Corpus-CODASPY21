The safety and well-being of our guests, staff members, and animals is a top priority.
Please note these policies when visiting the New England Aquarium:
Proper dress
Shirts and shoes must be worn in the Aquarium.
Bag size
Any bag larger than 12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches will not be permitted, with the exception of diaper bags and carriers for medical supplies. Bags, strollers, backpacks, and packages are subject to inspection.
Firearms
In an effort to ensure that New England Aquarium maintains a safe and nonviolent environment, visitors are prohibited from bringing firearms or other weapons onto property owned or leased by the Aquarium. A license to carry a weapon does not supersede this policy. Law enforcement personnel and certain preapproved visitors (e.g., armed bodyguards) are exempt from this policy.
Weapons include, but are not limited to, firearms, knives, explosives, and other items that require a License to Carry (LTC) or Firearms Identification card (FID) in addition to any item that is deemed a potential hazard to staff or visitors.
The New England Aquarium reserves the right to search all property owned or leased by the Aquarium for the purpose of determining compliance with this policy. Anyone found to be in violation of this policy will be asked to remove the weapon from our property immediately.
