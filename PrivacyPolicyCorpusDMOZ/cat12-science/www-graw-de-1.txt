If the processing of personal data is necessary to satisfy a contract, where one of the contracting parties is the person concerned, as is for example the case for processing procedures required for a delivery of goods or to provide a service or consideration, then processing is based on Sec. 6 I lit. b EU-GDPR. This also applies to such processing procedures, which are required to implement pre-contractual measures, such as in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation through which processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as to satisfy tax obligations, then processing is based on Sec. 6 I lit. c EU-GDPR. In rare cases the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect the vital interests of the person concerned or another individual. This would for example be the case if a visitor to our company is injured and then would have to give his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Sec. 6 I lit. d EU-GDPR. Lastly processing procedures might be based on Sec. 6 I lit. f EU-GDPR. Processing procedures are based on this legal basis if they are not included in any of the above-mentioned legal bases, if processing is necessary to preserve a justified interest of our company or a third party, insofar as the interests, fundamental rights and basic freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh other concerns. Such processing procedures are permitted in particular because they were mentioned specifically by the European legislator. The latter represented the opinion to this extent that a justified interest might be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the responsible person (recital 47 Clause 2 EU-GDPR).
