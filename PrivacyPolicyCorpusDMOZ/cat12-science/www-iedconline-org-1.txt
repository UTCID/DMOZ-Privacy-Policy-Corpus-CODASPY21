IEDC respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its website. IEDC strongly believes that if e-commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly. To protect online privacy, IEDC has implemented the following policy.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES IEDC COLLECT?
Most data IEDC collects are used only to help IEDC better serve its members. It is our general policy to collect and store only information that our members and visitors knowingly provide.
From General Visitors
IEDC does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website, aside from a visitor's IP address. This information and other aggregate data - such as the number of hits per page - are collected and used only for internal and marketing purposes.
Additionally, for e-mails sent in HTML format by IEDC, we will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that email. For those emails, IEDC will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: email address of a user, the date and time of the user's "click," a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number and destination page. IEDC only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products. This information is not sold or distributed in any other manner.
IEDC Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Logged In Visitors
To gain access to certain resources and personalization features on the IEDC website, members and other visitors are asked to register and provide general contact information. This data is submitted voluntarily. Similar information may be submitted to IEDC through membership applications, event registration, publication orders, and subscriptions.
HOW DOES IEDC USE DATA COLLECTED?
IEDC uses information voluntarily submitted by members and other customers in the following ways:
IEDC Member Services and Products
Generally, IEDC uses data collected to improve its own web content; to respond to visitors' interests, needs and preferences; and to develop new products and services.
Disclosures to Third Parties
IEDC makes member contact information available through the IEDC membership directory to other members using its website. On occasion, IEDC may also provide limited data to third parties that offer products and services. This data includes names, job titles, companies and business addresses, but does not include business phone numbers, business fax numbers or e-mail addresses. Users may request IEDC refrain from disclosing the data it collects to third parties by contacting IEDC at membership@iedconline.org or (202) 223-7800.
Credit Card Account Information
When members or visitors provide credit card account information to IEDC, IEDC submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate financial institution. IEDC does not further disclose credit card account information obtained from members or visitors.
HOW DOES IEDC USE COOKIES?
Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a visitor's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie). IEDC uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, and to store and track passwords. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about visitors over the Internet or to analyze any information that visitors have knowingly or unknowingly provided. Visitors may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a "persistent" cookie and rather accept only a "per-session" cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the site to enjoy the full benefits. If the visitor declines the attachment of any cookie, the visitor may not have access to the full benefits of the website.
WHAT PRIVACY ISSUES ARISE WITH LINKS TO OTHER SITES?
This website contains links to other websites. IEDC has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites.
IEDC COPYRIGHT & INFRINGEMENTS
All materials posted by IEDC on the IEDC website are subject to copyrights owned by IEDC and other individuals or entities.
WHAT MEANS OF REDRESS ARE AVAILABLE?
If you suspect IEDC has handled its personal information in a manner that does not comply with this privacy statement, please contact us by e-mailing to membership@iedconline.org or by calling (202) 223-7800.
