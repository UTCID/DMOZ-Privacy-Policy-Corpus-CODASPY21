Australia needs a new prescription for healthcare – a focus on prevention and wellness, enabled by technology.
To help meet this challenge, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE) has drawn on expertise from across the nation to prepare a map for step-change, to prepare A New Prescription: preparing for a healthcare transformation.

WEBINAR
The Future of Health Technology
We recorded a webinar we ran on 26th June 2020. See the recording at the bottom of this page.
For several decades, Australia’s healthcare system has increased life expectancy and improved quality of life.
Now healthcare in Australia is under strain, challenged by an ageing population, chronic illnesses, evolving consumer behaviour, and changes in the type and frequency of
emerging diseases.
The digital revolution has readied Australia for a more rounded approach to wellness, and a radical shift to preventive healthcare. A New Prescription outlines how we can take best advantage of existing and emerging technology, to kick-start that shift.
In the decade to 2030, we predict:
paper files will disappear, replaced by secure electronic health records
health professionals will share patient information through universally accessible software
big data will enable accurate monitoring and prediction of population health trends
precision medicine will be more common, with prevention and treatment targeted to individuals
genetic testing and screening for preventable disease will become affordable
smart devices, mobile health and telehealth – all linked through a digital health record – will enable a real-time holistic picture of a person’s health.
technological solutions to the problems of distance and mobility will enable affordable healthcare access for more Australians, when and where we need it.

The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering is undertaking a major three-year (2018–2020) Australian Research Council Learned Academies Special Projects-funded research project to examine the readiness of different Australian industry sectors to develop, adapt and adopt new and emerging technologies, with a horizon out to 2030.
The health technology sector is the second industry sector to be examined by the project.
