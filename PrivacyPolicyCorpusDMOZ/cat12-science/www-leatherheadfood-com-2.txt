Which countries do we transfer your personal data to?
We may share your personal data within Science Group companies who are based in the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA in accordance with this privacy policy and/or in accordance with contractual arrangements agreed with you.

We may also transfer your personal data outside the EEA to other third parties in accordance with this privacy policy and/or in accordance with contractual arrangements agreed with you. Please see the section on “Who we share your personal data with” for more information.
However, we shall only transfer your personal data outside the EEA if one of the following conditions apply:
• The transfer is to a country which the European Commission sees as providing adequate protection for your personal data
• The transfer is to third parties in the USA who are signed up to Privacy Shield. This requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US
• You have consented to this
• There is another legal basis on which we are entitled to make the transfer
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
How we protect your personal data
Our website is hosted on servers in the European Economic Area. We have appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access to your personal data. We use network access control technology to limit access to the systems on which personal data is stored, and our IT team monitor for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However as the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our website.
We note that the information you provide may be confidential and we will not sell or otherwise make your personal data commercially available to any third party except that we may share information with third parties. Please see the section on ‘Who we share your personal data with’
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office where we are legally required to do so.

Please note that we may ask for further information from you in order to prove your identity before disclosing any personal data to you. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request.
