Use of Documentation
ISS is dedicated to provide innovative fluorescence instrumentation to scientists working in the life sciences, drug discovery, material sciences and basic physical-chemical research applications. Our fluorescence product line includes steady-state spectrofluorometers, spectrometers for the determination of multiple decay times, fluorescence microscopes, laser scanning confocal microscopes, a spectrometer for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and a particle-tracking system for single molecule detection.
ISS has a long history of innovation and holds the relevant patents pertinent to frequency-domain instrumentation: ISS is the leader in frequency-domain time-resolved fluorescence instrumentation. ISS instruments share a series of interchangeable accessories covering a variety of applications; modular components allow the user to upgrade the instrumentation with novel capabilities as well as to assemble a custom-designed instrument. Instruments are designed with an open architecture from the excitation side to the collection channels; the excitation light sources of ISS instruments are xenon arc lamps, continuous wave lasers, laser diodes, light emitting diodes, multiphoton lasers and synchrotron radiation rings.
