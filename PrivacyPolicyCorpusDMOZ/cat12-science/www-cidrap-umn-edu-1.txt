Privacy Policy
Online Privacy StatementThe policy of the University of Minnesota and of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) is to respect the privacy of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which CIDRAP Web sites collect information, the uses to which that information will be put, and the ways in which we will protect any information you choose to provide us.CIDRAP Web sites use Google Analytics for gathering statistics about Web traffic. Use of cookies by Google Analytics is covered by their privacy policy. CIDRAP Web pages can be identified by page URLs that begin with the following:CIDRAP Web sitePage URLInfectious Disease Information and other related topics              http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/There are five types of information that a site may collect during your visit: network traffic logs, Web visit logs, cookies, learning tracking information, and information voluntarily provided by you.Network Traffic LogsIn the course of ensuring network security and consistent service for all users, the University employs software programs to do such things as monitor network traffic, identify unauthorized access or access to nonpublic information, detect computer viruses and other software that might damage University computers or the network, and monitor and tune the performance of the University network. In the course of such monitoring, these programs may detect such information as e-mail headers, addresses from network packets, and other information. Information from these activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance of the University's networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable information from these activities is not released to external parties without your consent unless required by law.Web Visit LogsUniversity Web sites routinely collect and store information from online visitors to help manage those sites and improve service. This information includes the pages visited on the site, the date and time of the visit, the internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the domain name and IP address from which the access occurred, the version of browser used, the capabilities of the browser, and search terms used on our search engines. University sites make no attempt to identify individual visitors from this information: any personally identifiable information is not released to external parties without your consent unless required by law.CookiesCookies are pieces of information stored by your Web browser on behalf of a Web site and returned to the Web site on request. A University site may use cookies for two purposes: to carry data about your current session at the site from one Web page to the next, and to identify you to the site between visits. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may turn them off in your browser, or may set your browser to ask you before accepting a new cookie. Some pages may not function properly if the cookies are turned off. Unless otherwise notified on this site, we will not store data, other than for these two purposes, in cookies.
