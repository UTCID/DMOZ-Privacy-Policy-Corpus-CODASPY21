ConclusionJava, JavaScript, Flash, and Shockwave are here to stay.
Although Java will probably never live up to its initial hype,
Java-based stock tickers, mortgage calculators, and graphing agents
provide web developers with convenient and reasonably secure systems
for moving computation from the web server to the end user’s computer.
Likewise JavaScript, despite some initial bumps, has shaped up to be a
reasonably secure system for implementing shopping carts and providing
client-side form validation.Because of the risks that arise from buggy implementation and
the poor track records of Java and JavaScript to date, we recommend
that none of the mobile code systems described in the chapter be used
in high security environments. However, most Internet users can
probably use these technologies without much fear—provided that they
are careful to download browser updates when security problems are
discovered.
