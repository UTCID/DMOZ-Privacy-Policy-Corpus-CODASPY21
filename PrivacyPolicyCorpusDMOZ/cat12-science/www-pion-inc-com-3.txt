Cookie PolicyCookies and Other Tracking TechnologiesWe also collect information about your use of PION Sites through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site, e-mail or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you on the basis of “clickstream” data that shows your previous activities on PION Sites.We use Google Analytics to better understand our audience.  In connection with that we, and Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize and serve information provided on our website as well as potentially displaying ads across the Internet, based on a user’s past visits to PION Sites.We also may utilize Display Advertising (such as Retargeting with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) to (1) show our ads based on your prior visits to PION Sites, and (2) better understand our ad impressions and use of ad services. In connection with the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting service, we may use data from interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to understand and improve our marketing campaigns and Site content.You can opt out of Google Ads by visiting https://www.google.com/ads/preferences. If you do not want your data used by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at the Google Analytics opt-out page.Similarly, we may have LinkedIn tracking script running which serves advertisements based on activity on the PION Sites.We may work with new technologies in the future that require cookies or web beacons to provide their services. As we work with new technologies, their descriptions will be updated in the Privacy Policy.  This PION Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.To learn more about cookies and other tracking technologies, including how to disable them, please visit https://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
