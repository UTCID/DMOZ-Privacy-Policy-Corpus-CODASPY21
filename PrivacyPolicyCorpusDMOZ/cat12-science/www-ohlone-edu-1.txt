Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. Your personal information will not be sold. Your personal information will not be shared with unaffiliated third parties except as necessary to maintain and process client accounts or when the law requires it.
Ohlone College has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Ohlone College websites.
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our websites. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information.
Our site's College registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers (like their Student ID Number), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their ZIP code or age).
The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary.
Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for College registration and to bill the user for classes. Unique identifiers (such as Student IDNumbers) are collected to verify the user's identity. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site to help us determine future requirements for Ohlone's websites.
This site contains links to other sites. Ohlone College is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
To Remove Your Email Address from Our Student Enrollment Database
Ohlone College respects your privacy. Your email address is part of your official record. We highly recommend that if you are currently enrolled, do not remove your email address from our database as this is the main way Ohlone College communicates with students.
If you prefer to opt out of email from Ohlone College, please do so through WebAdvisor. Select the "My Contact Info & Email Change" link to remove your email address from our database. By removing your email address, you will not receive any email from the College regarding registration, special class offerings, student orientation, etc.
You may reverse this action at any time by putting your email address back into our database through WebAdvisor.
To Remove Your Email Address from Other Ohlone College Mailing Lists
A number of sources may be sending you email messages—it could be a student organization, an individual department or program, the performing arts venue, or other group at Ohlone, and all of them might be operating from separate databases or mailing lists.
You can contact the group sending the email message. Or, you can use your email software to block certain email messages and send them to a junk folder. Refer to help information for your email software or search the Internet for assistance.
