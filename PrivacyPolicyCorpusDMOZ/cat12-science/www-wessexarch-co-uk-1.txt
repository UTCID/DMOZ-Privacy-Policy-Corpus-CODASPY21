Staff
For full details of staff data that we legitimately collect and process staff can access the procedure HR-PR-029-A.
Customers
The majority of our customers are businesses and are not therefore supplying us with personal data other than their name along with their business contact details.
Some customers are private individuals requiring our services. We only collect their name, address and phone numbers to be able to supply the required service or advice.
All customer information is held on our secure customer database.
Subcontractors
Subcontracted business services usually supply us with contact names and business contact details thereafter. This information is held on our secure customer database.
Some subcontractors are freelance specialists who we take on, on a temporary contract for a specific project. As such we treat them as suppliers and the data we collect is name, address, (emergency contact details if site working) and payment details to pay their invoice. This information is kept on our secure customer database.
Volunteers & Work experience students
Volunteers are asked to fill in and sign a volunteer application and agreement (HR-F-025-001-A), and we ask for name, address, email and telephone numbers as well as emergency contact name and details. This information allows us to contact them and keep them up to date with opportunities for volunteering with us and attending training events/talks etc.
Medical and relevant prescribed medication information is requested to enable us to ensure volunteer safety and comfort whilst working with us, but it does not exclude them from working with us. Other information is requested to be used in anonymised reporting on our diversity profile but is only given and used by consent on the form.
This information is held securely and confidentially and only available to the HR team and relevant members of the Outreach department.
Work experience students are asked to fill in and sign a contact and emergency contact details form (HR-F-026-001-A).  We ask for name, address, email and telephone numbers as well as emergency contact name and details. We also ask their age and school year to help us deliver the best learning experience. The information we collect allows us to contact them and keep them up to date with their planned work experience week with us.
Medical and relevant prescribed medication information is requested to enable us to ensure work experience student safety and comfort during their work experience with us, but it does not exclude them from working with us.
Other information is requested to be used in anonymised reporting on our diversity profile but is only given and used by consent on the form. This information is held securely and confidentially and only available to the HR team and relevant members of the Outreach department.

The full details are held securely and confidentially and only available to the Company Secretary and the CEO.
Landowners
We need to contact landowners of sites where archaeological archives are generated to gain their permission to deposit the archive with the relevant museum to facilitate its long-term preservation.
The information we request is a name and address so that we can send them a Transfer of Title form to fill in; these details are then passed to the museum who have a legitimate interest in acquiring them as part of the legal agreement that the Transfer of Title constitutes, and will not use them for any other purpose than to acknowledge said Transfer of Title.
At Wessex Archaeology these details are kept securely within the archives folder where only relevant members of the archives team have access and are retained at Wessex Archaeology until deposited and the Archive Transmittal Record is completed.
External Processors
We use data processors for our staff payroll and pensions along with DBS services. We share personal data with them where it is necessary for them to carry out their duties as our data processors or where you have given us your prior consent.
Wessex Archaeology undertakes checks to ensure that external parties who process data on our behalf (such as pensions and payroll) are compliant with the GDPR.
Special Category Data
We may be required to process data that is more sensitive such as:
data relating to medical information,
gender,
religion,
race,
sexual orientation,
