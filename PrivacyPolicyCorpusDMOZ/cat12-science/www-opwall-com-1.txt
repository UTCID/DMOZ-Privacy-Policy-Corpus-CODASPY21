As part of their contract they are required to implement industry best practice for securing the data electronically, and recommend security updates and changes to Operation Wallacea where appropriate.Data collection of participants occurs through https://portal.opwall.com which is the client facing side of the client database.4.2. Other Security MeasuresOperation Wallacea has a data security policy that outlines all practices and precautions that must be implemented by staff in order to keep data safe. This includes items such as password policies, requirements for device encryption, procedures for securing data when on expeditions and local security measures for offices.5. How We Use the Information Collected 5.1. Basis Under Which We Use DataUnder GDPR article six we are required to provide a lawful basis in order to process all personal data. The lawful basis under which we do that processing are as follows;To fulfil our contractual responsibility to deliver services to our participants (processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract)To comply with the legal requirement for invoicing within the UK (processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject)To market to those who have requested information about our services (the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes)To pursue Operation Wallacea’s legitimate interests of improving service experience, ensuring adequate health and safety of all expedition participants. (processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child)5.2. Specific Data Types5.2.1. NameName is how we identify individuals, and is required for numerous booking procedures relating to delivering expedition services. For example they are required to book flight tickets, hotel rooms and transfers.5.2.2. Email Address, Telephone Numbers, AddressesWe use contact information to respond to inquiries, send information as part of providing an expedition, and pass on important pieces of information regarding a participants expedition.We are required to have a valid address in order to issue invoices under UK law.We may use that contact information to market to potential clients (this excludes potential staff and other contacts), and marketing can be opted out of at any time.All participants of an expedition, upon completion of that expedition, are offered the chance to join an email newsletter in order to keep them up to date with Operation Wallacea.5.2.3. Date of BirthWe need date of birth as our programs are not suitable, or may require modification, for certain age groups. Provisions may also need to be made for consent or supervision.5.2.4. Nationality, Passport Number, Passport Expiry DateNationality, passport number and passport expiry date may be required at numerous different levels of expedition preparation. This can include, but is not limited to – booking flights, booking hotel rooms, permit applications.We also use it to advise on visa or other immigration related items.5.2.5. GenderWe require gender in order to do rooming allocations.5.2.6. Emergency Contact InformationWe hold emergency contact information if there is a need to contact someone with regards to an issue or incident that may have impacted an individual on expedition.5.2.7. Diet PreferencesWe require diet information in order to ensure that all dietary needs are met for each participant.5.2.8. Medical InformationMedical information is counted as a special category under article nine of the GDPR, and as such we are required to ensure we have an additional lawful basis for collecting and processing that data.“the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;”We ask for specific consent in order to process the medical information of our participants, however it is required that all of our participants complete this information and we cannot bring those who do not submit medical information on an expedition. (See 2.2)Specific types of medical information required are as follows, as well as the guidance included on https://portal.opwall.com when the participant is completing it and the reasoning behind requesting that information.5.2.8.1. Current Medications“If you are taking any medication please list those, including dosage information and the condition it is used to treat. Please also include any medications you carry but do not regularly take, for example epi-pens or inhalers.”Current medication, or recently taken medication, is a primary piece of information requested by medics or doctors in emergency situations, particularly if the individual is incapacitated or cannot respond verbally.5.2.8.2. Current Allergies, and Severity of Those Allergies“If you have any drug or environmental allergies please indicate their nature.”“If you’ve listed allergies above please describe the severity of the reaction, and whether you carry an epi-pen in the case of severe allergies, when your last reaction was, and the regularity of the reaction.”We need to be able to ensure that we are not putting people at risk from the expedition environment, and use this question to ensure that we can remove or mitigate the risk of a potential allergic reaction, particularly severe ones. In certain instances, this can also impact expedition procedure – for example determining the location of available adrenaline/epi-pens.Drug allergies (for example for antibiotics or anaesthetics) is also information that has to be passed on to medics or doctors in emergency situations, particularly if the individual is incapacitated or cannot respond verbally.5.2.8.3. Current Medical Conditions“Please list anything you regularly see a doctor for, is reoccurring, requires ongoing treatment, or any physical impairments. Please also include in this field any other medically related items that may impact your expedition, e.g. pregnancy.”This is used to give us a general overview of individual health. There are numerous potential conditions that may impact a participant’s safety on expedition, some of which may not be immediately apparent to those that haven’t been to the expedition location.Current medical conditions is also information that has to be passed on to medics or doctors in emergency situations, particularly if the individual is incapacitated or cannot respond verbally.Knowledge of current conditions may impact diagnosis of any potential problems.5.2.8.4. Past Medical Conditions“Anything you’ve regularly seen a doctor for in the past.”It is possible that medical conditions may re-occur in an expedition environment, and in an emergency this information may be requested by medics or doctors.5.2.8.1. Current Psychiatric Issues / Past Psychiatric Issues“Please include any effect these have on your daily life and any triggers where applicable.”“Please include length of time since recovery and how/if you received treatment.”Operation Wallacea expeditions, by design, take place in environments that are frequently challenging both physically and mentally. Understanding participants’ mental health statuses may impact our medical and operational preparations, and allow us to inform our participants about any potential issues they may themselves have on site.5.2.9. CV or ResumePotential staff members are asked to submit a CV or Resume in order to determine their suitability for a job role. These are occasionally, albeit infrequently, given to in-country partners if the role is being recruit for by both Operation Wallacea and the partner.6. Information That We Share 6.1. Permanent Staff MembersOperation Wallacea is based within the UK, but has a number of contracted staff members located in other countries that primarily market internationally. Most prominently this does include offices based in the United States and Canada. Those staff members have access to the client database, which is used to store all information on all categories of individual. The database itself is hosted within the UK (see section 4 and 6.4.5)All our permanent staff members, regardless of location, are required as part of their employment to adhere to a centrally distributed data security policy regardless of the local laws in the country in which they’re based.6.1.1. Country ManagersEach individual expedition is led by an Operation Wallacea staff member known as the “Country Manager” who has overall responsibility for that project and the health and safety of all participants. The country manager has received training on data protection and is responsible for ensuring that the guidelines placed down in the Operation Wallacea data security policy are adhered to on expedition.6.2. Field and Temporary Staff MembersDue to the operating protocols of Operation Wallacea during expeditions, there are certain staff members that need to receive information that are not contracted to Operation Wallacea on a permanent basis. These individuals are typically recruited for a specific contract and due to the nature of their roles may have to receive personal information of participants.These staff members are given information only pertinent to their role, but this may include sensitive items such as medical information. They are trained in data protection procedures and are contractually required to follow the data protection procedures laid out in Operation Wallacea’s data security policy.The staff member responsible for the overall management of an expedition (Country Manager – see section 6.1.1) is required to ensure that the data given to these individuals is deleted upon the completion of their contract.6.2.1. Camp or Site ManagersCamp/site managers are responsible for the wellbeing of all individuals within a specific location. They are only given information related to the individuals at that location, but this may include medical information to ensure on-site health and safety standards or the safety of a participant during an incident or emergency.6.2.2. MedicsExpedition medics are given the details of all participants that they are responsible for during the duration of their contract. They are typically issued this information prior to the expedition in an anonymised format to allow them to prepare, or raise any medical concerns or queries about participants to the site management team. Once they reach site, they are given access to a non-anonymised version of the participants they share a location with.6.2.3. Other StaffAll other on-site staff receive information that is only relevant to their potential job role.For example:Those responsible for food preparation will receive names, dietary requirements and where appropriate allergy information.Those responsible for leading students in the field may be given names and limited health information if the site manager or medic determines that a specific participants medical history may put them at risk on a particular activity.The determination of what is appropriate to pass on to which staff member is made by the country manager. (See 6.1.1)6.3. Transfers of Data Outside the European Economic AreaThe majority of our in-country partners are based in “third countries” that fall outside the European Economic Area. They are all contracted as data processors under article 26 of the GDPR and are required to adhere to the data processing and security described in section 6.2.We do not transfer data to any organisation outside the European Economic Area that is not contracted as a data processor.6.4. Data ProcessorsData processors are organisations that we have contracted to perform a particular service or task for us. Those contractual obligations require that we pass them certain pieces of personal information, and as such we require that there are data protection and confidentiality provisions built into their contract.Specifically, they are required to:Only act on the written instructions of Operation Wallacea;Ensure that people processing the data are subject to a duty of confidence;Take appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing;Only engage sub-processors with the prior consent of Operation Wallacea and under a written contract;Assist Operation Wallacea in providing subject access and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR;Assist Operation Wallacea in meeting its GDPR obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches and data protection impact assessments;Delete or return all personal data to Operation Wallacea as requested at the end of the contract (as a minimum all personal data that is not legally required to keep should be deleted within 8 weeks of the individual’s expedition) andSubmit to audits and inspections, provide Operation Wallacea with whatever information it needs to ensure that they are both meeting their GDPR Article 28 obligations, and tell Operation Wallacea immediately if it is asked to do something infringing the GDPR or other data protection law of the EU or a member state.6.4.1. In-Country PartnersEach Operation Wallacea expedition has a local partner organisation based in the country in which the expedition takes place. The roles and responsibilities of those partners vary significantly from country to country. Some have only minimal involvement in project preparation, setup, and execution whereas others are involved in every single aspect of it.For example, they are frequently required to book accommodation, arrange transfers, buy supplies (eg food) and where appropriate hire local people as assist the expedition as cooks, guides and other ancillary staff members, among other items.The only information passed over is that which is required for the in-country partner to complete their contract. This usually includes the following information collected via the Opwall Portal (https://portal.opwall.com)Name as displayed on passportTelephone numberDate of BirthGenderNationalityPassport numberPassport expiry dateDiet preferencesDetails on current links with academic institutions or schoolsAllergy Information (See 6.4.2.1) 6.4.2. Transference of Medical Information to In-Country PartnersAs a sensitive category of data, medical information is excluded from transfer to in-country Partners in all but the following exceptions:6.4.2.1. Allergy InformationTo minimize the risk to our participants of encountering a potential allergic reaction we do ensure that allergy information is passed to local partners. This is used to ensure that, alongside dietary information, those that may be involved in food preparation are aware of potential risks to the students.It also ensures the participant accommodations are aware of any environmental issues that the participant may have.6.4.2.2. PADI/SSI Documentation and Marine ActivitiesThe Professional Association of Dive Instructors (hereafter known to as PADI) are the qualifying body for dive professionals utilized by Operation Wallacea on the majority of expeditions. We, and our in-country partners, hire PADI qualified staff exclusively to run in-water marine activities for those sites.The sole exception to that is the Madagascar expedition, where Scuba Schools International (hereafter known as SSI) staff members are hired by our partner dive centre.The forms that are required by PADI/SSI are almost identical, with the medical form used by both organizations being put together by the UHMS (Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society).Both organisations have a requirement that all people participating in an activity supervised by one of their professionals complete a medical form to ensure that they are safe to dive, and that form must be seen and inspected by that professional.That medical form lists many conditions that may impact diving, and if the person completing it confirms they have that condition they are required to get the form signed by a doctor.In addition, Operation Wallacea also utilizes more conservative measures for dive safety due to the remote nature of the expeditions. There are a number of additional sub-questions that we have entered into the form at the recommendation of diving doctors, and for certain answers we will require that the participant visit a dive specialist instead of a regular physician.Those forms, as such, can contain medical information. As a number of our in-country partners are also contracted to provide diving activities, these documents have to be passed to the relevant dive professionals.6.4.2.3. Acting as Camp Managers or MedicsIn a small number of instances, the in-country partner will also take a position as on-site management for a camp or expedition, or will have staff that are acting as medics.Within those roles they are responsible for the health and safety of all participants in their care, and as such need to receive the additional medical information submitted by the individual i.e.;Current medicationsCurrent medical conditionsPast medical conditionsCurrent psychiatric issuesPast psychiatric issuesWhile in a position where they are acting in a role as a camp manager or medic, the in-country partner is required to ensure that information is kept safe according to the Operation Wallacea data security policy.6.4.3. Flight ProvidersDuring the booking process participants are asked if they wish for their details to be passed on to a flight provider to simplify their travel procedures. This takes two potential forms that determines what information is transferred.For school/field trip groups that are booking an expedition with Operation Wallacea as a package that includes flights. (Name, nationality, passport number and expiry, date of birth, gender, dietary requirements and allergy information, school attending).For individuals that have opted into that contact during initial booking. (Name, date of birth, email address, phone number).6.4.4. Insurers – AvivaOperation Wallacea has an insurance policy in place with Aviva that covers all participants for the duration of their expedition. This insurance policy includes unlimited Overseas Medical and Travel Expenses, cover for Personal Property and Cancellation, Curtailment and Rearrangement cover for all participantsThere is no data transferred to Aviva prior to an expedition barring the numbers of individuals undertaking it.Data is only transferred to them in the instance of a claim, wherein only data relevant to that claim will be given to them.
