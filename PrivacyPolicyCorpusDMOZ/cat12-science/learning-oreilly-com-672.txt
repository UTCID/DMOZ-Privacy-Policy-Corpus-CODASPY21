technical information that is too detailed for the main body of this
book.Appendix A is a first-person
account of the ISP that offers service exclusively on Martha’s
Vineyard.Appendix B contains more
detailed information about the SSL and TLS protocols. This chapter won’t
give you enough information to write your own SSL or TLS implementation,
but it will give you an understanding of what is happening on the
wire.Appendix C is a detailed
introduction to the P3P specification. This chapter, written by Lorrie
Faith Cranor and included with permission, includes information on how
to write your own P3P policy.Appendix D provides detailed
information on the PICS specification. Although PICS appears largely
dead today, a PICS implementation is included in Microsoft’s Internet
Explorer, so PICS is still there for anybody who wants to use it.Appendix E is a listing of
books, articles, and web sites containing further helpful information
about web security, privacy, and commerce.
