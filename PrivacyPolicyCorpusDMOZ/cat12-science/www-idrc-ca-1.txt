Traffic source data, including the ways visitors arrive at www.idrc.ca (for example search engines, referrals from other sites, marketing campaigns, and social media), keywords visitors entered into a search engine and that brought them to our website, and the landing and exit page used by which a visitors enters and leave our site.
Content related data, including measuring user visits and page views to determine the site’s most popular content, technical performance of the site as measured by such elements as average time taken to load a page and server speed, and technical performance broken down further by country and web browser.
The information generated by cookies about your use of this website (including your IP address, truncated to ensure your anonymity) is transmitted to Google. This information is used to compile statistical reports on the website’s activities and enhance the user online experience.
