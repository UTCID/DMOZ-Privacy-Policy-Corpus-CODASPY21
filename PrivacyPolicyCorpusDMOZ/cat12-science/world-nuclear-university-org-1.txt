The Association may also collect personal data of the same nature for any accompanying persons. The Association may also collect information where visitors or subscribers participate in certain Association activities, such as questionnaires and surveys, and through the use of cookies. When visitors request pages from our server, our web server automatically collects some information about them, including their IP addresses. These addresses are used by computers on the network to send the requested pages to visitors.

The Association will not reveal any of your personal information to any third party without your permission or as permitted in accordance with our legitimate interests or as required by law. The Association uses visitors’ IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our visitors in general. This information does not contain any details that can identify visitors personally.
Using email addresses and appropriate indications of consent provided at registration or collected otherwise, The Association periodically sends out email newsletters and promotional emails to our visitors about services and publications offered by this website. Visitors can indicate whether they wish to receive such information from The Association and may update their preferences by following the instructions included in each such communication.
