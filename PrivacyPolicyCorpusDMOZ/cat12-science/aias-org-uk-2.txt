Originality
All manuscripts submitted to Strata should be original, and not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Plagiarism of other authors, as well as self-plagiarism, will not be tolerated.
Sources of research data
At all times authors should be clear and explicit about the
source of the material they work on and undertake to ensure that their research
data has been obtained in a legal and ethical manner. In accordance with the 1970
UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, Strata will
not knowingly publish articles on unprovenanced artefacts, unless it can be demonstrated
that the material has been in a collection since before 14 November 1970 (when
the convention was signed), or has been legally obtained and exported from its
country of origin since that date. Moreover, Strata will not publish any
material whose ownership is in dispute, or which is under suspicion of having
been stolen or illicitly obtained. An exception may be made for research whose
aim is to examine the illicit antiquities trade, expose fraudulent objects,
explore the loss of archaeological context, or to raise ethical issues
surrounding this material, at the discretion of the editors.
Reviews of books that do not follow these guidelines should indicate as far as possible that the publication includes material lacking archaeological provenance or may involve questionable ethics, and explore the implications of this.Strata also undertakes not to accept sponsorship from antiquities dealers, or to undertake any activities that would promote the antiquities trade.
Journal Access
Strata is currently published in print format, with electronic copies of the journal being made available online after a ‘moving wall’ embargo, currently set to three years. The journal content is regularly backed up onto additional servers as a further security measure.
