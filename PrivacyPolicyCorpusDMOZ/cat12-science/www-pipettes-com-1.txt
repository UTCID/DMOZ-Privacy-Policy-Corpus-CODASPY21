Terms & Conditions
Decontamination of your instruments is a requirement
Pipettes.com requires that all instruments submitted for calibration and repair need to be decontaminated from chemical, biohazardous, and radioactive contamination prior to submitting them for calibration. This ensures the health and safety of our technicians as well as protecting your organization from any potential liability. Details for this procedure can be supplied by a member of our staff. If this requirement is not met, a nominal fee of $50 will be billed when returning the equipment uncalibrated. This fee will then be waived after the pipettes are appropriately decontaminated and resubmitted for calibration.
