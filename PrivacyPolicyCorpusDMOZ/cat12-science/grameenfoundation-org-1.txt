We couldn’t do this work without our corporate partnerships. Organizations like yours provide valuable grants, in-kind donations, employee matches, and volunteers. Our corporate partners are key drivers in our work to break the cycle of poverty for the world’s poorest, especially women, through access to microfinance and technology.
We have a long history of developing unique, mutually beneficial relationships with a wide range of corporations. There are a number of ways your company can get involved with Grameen Foundation:
Matching gifts
Add Grameen Foundation to your matching gift program and help every dollar go farther.
Encourage your employees to volunteer
Grameen Foundation’s signature volunteer initiative, Bankers without Borders® (BwB), strategically connects skilled professionals with poverty-focused social enterprises around the world. Despite its name, BwB is not just for bankers. Every professional in your organization can find meaningful ways to put their time and talents to work to empower the poor.
