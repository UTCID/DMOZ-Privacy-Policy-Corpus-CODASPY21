We believe that Australia’s economic competitiveness and social and environmental well-being depend on translating its science and technology research into industry innovation and application – a process vitally strengthened through effective international engagement.
International engagement is a long-term investment that builds trusted and culturally sensitive relationships developed at the personal, institutional and diplomatic levels.
It is enhanced when programs are aligned with national priorities.
Our long-standing ties with USA and Europe are important, but Australia also needs targeted activities to strengthen ties with Asia, where economies and technological innovation capabilities are growing rapidly.
