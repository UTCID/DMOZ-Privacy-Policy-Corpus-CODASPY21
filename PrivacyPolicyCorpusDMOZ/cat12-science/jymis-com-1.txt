Email:
Email is private correspondence between the sender and the recipient.
Barring the requirements of law and similar exigencies, we won't read
your email or allow others to do so.
See our Service Agreement for full details.
Demographics:
The demographics we collect are used by us, our advertisers
and our agents
solely for the purpose of advertising to our users within the
context of their use of our services.
For example, an advertiser may sponsor an email sent to your
account based on your age, but the advertiser
would not receive the list of users the email is sent to.
For Professional Email service,
we don't share demographics with anyone.
