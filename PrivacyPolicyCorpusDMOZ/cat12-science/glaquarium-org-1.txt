Terms of Use
Welcome to glaquarium.org. This website is owned and operated by the Lake Superior Center dba Great Lakes Aquarium, a Minnesota non-profit corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “GLA“). The following terms and conditions (together with any documents referred to in them) (collectively, these “Terms“) apply to your use of our website (“Site“), and any information we may access through social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter (collectively, our “System“), which is owned and operated by us.
Your use of the GLA website means that you accept and agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms or our Privacy Policy, do not use or access the System.
We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion, and will post any updates to the Terms of Use on the Site. Your continued use of our Site or System, or any other service provided through glaquarium.org, means that you accept and agree to the modified Terms of Use.
Use of Third Party Sites and Services
GLA uses third-party providers for e-commerce store services and credit card processing services.  Currently, GLA’s third-party providers are current WooCommerce (www.woocommerce.com) and Authorize.net (www.authorize.net) (collectively, the “Third-Party Providers”).  GLA reserves the right to change the identities of the Third Party Providers without notice or your consent.  By using the System to purchase tickets or other merchandise from GLA, you are agreeing to be bound by the policies of the Third-Party Providers. The terms of service for WooCommerce are available at www.woocommerce.comand for Authorize.net at www.authorize.net.
By using the System, you agree that you will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend GLA and its officers, affiliates, and assigns, from any claim based on your use or misuse of the Third-Party Providers systems and services.
Credit Card Policies and Access to Personal Data
GLA does not retain, store, or have access to your credit card information, which you submit to a Third-Party Provider as part of the ticket purchase process.  GLA’s Third-Party Service Providers may retain that data as part of the purchase process.
GLA does not have access to any passwords that you create when you use the System to purchase tickets or other merchandise. GLA’s Third-Party Service Providers may retain that data as part of the purchase process.
Ticket Purchase and Delivery
After you complete the purchase process, you will receive an email with the tickets attached as a PDF document. You will need the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug-in, available from www.adobe.com, to view and print your ticket(s). The PDF may be printed or saved on a mobile device for admission to GLA. GLA will not print and mail tickets to you.
Each ticket is unique and every visitor in your party must have an individual ticket, which is valid for a single use at GLA.  The exception is for children age 2 and under, who will receive free admission to the Aquarium.
Ticket Refunds
Refunds are available only for tickets purchased online via the System, and must be requested within 120 days of purchase.
