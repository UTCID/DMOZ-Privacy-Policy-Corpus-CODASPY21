Privacy Policy of Computational Chemistry List, Ltd
Computational Chemistry List, Ltd. does not
share personal information (name, address, e-mail, telephone number,
or credit card and other payment information) that you provide to us when
registering or purchasing our services. The sensitive information
(like credit card numbers), are not stored on the server at all.
We do not sell, rent or share your personal data and email addresses
with anyone, unless you specifically provided us with this information
for this purpose. Your contact information is publicly displayed
on the Web site and shared with CCL subscribers in the
following instances:
during public discussions on the Computational List forums,
in the archives of these discussions that are available on our
web server,
in the archives of contributed materials: data, software, documents, etc.
when specifically provided for public dissemination,
in the advertisements of conferences, job openings, web sites of sponsors,
etc., when you specifically provided this information for public
dissemination or advertising.
In instances listed above, providing your name,
email address, and other contact information is expected, and it is
your responsibility to control the extent of this information.
Even in this case, when it is practically feasible, we obfuscate your
email addresses to make it difficult for spyware on CCL
subscribers computers and for web based email harvesting
robots to collect email addresses from our site.
We will be grateful for any suggestions as to make the CCL site even
more privacy conscious and secure, though, the CCL being a public
discussion forum and Web site, does not condone anonymous postings
and distributions.
All other communications (e.g., email to/from CCL
managers and administrators, invoices and receipts), are kept in
secure, password protected areas of our server, and are not publicly
accessible.
