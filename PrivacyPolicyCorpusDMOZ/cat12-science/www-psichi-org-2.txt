Psi Chi has guidelines regarding the use of chapter contact information found on the Psi Chi website, and has a policy regarding contacting Psi Chi chapters about third-party offers (such as graduate school program information). For Psi Chi's privacy policy concerning membership information, please read that privacy policy here.
CONTACTING PSI CHI CHAPTERS: USAGE POLICY
Contact information for Psi Chi chapters is provided solely for the purpose of aiding communication between chapters and members of Psi Chi. Use of this contact information for unsolicited purposes (without the authorization of the Psi Chi Central Office) is strictly prohibited.
For instance, if a Psi Chi chapter wants to coordinate activities or service projects with another Psi Chi chapter in its local area, this would be a valid reason to look up and use a Psi Chi chapter's contact information. Another valid use would be a member of Psi Chi wanting to contact her or his chapter or chapter faculty advisor.
However, any person wanting to contact a Psi Chi chapter for purposes such as (but not limited to) advertising, recommendations (books, speakers, guides, reference materials), research participation, or other third-party solicitations without Psi Chi's approval is strictly prohibited.
Psi Chi, as an organization and as voted on by the Psi Chi Board of Directors, cannot affiliate, endorse, favor, advertise, or recommend one person's (or one organization's) services, materials or surveys due to Psi Chi's being a nonprofit organization for the entire field of psychology.
