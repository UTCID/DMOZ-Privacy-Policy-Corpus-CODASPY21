Cookies
General principles regarding the use of cookies and other files/tags
Our Websites use cookies, pixel tags and other forms of
identification and local storage (together referred to as "tags/files"
hereunder) to distinguish you from other users of our Websites. This
helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our Websites
and also allows us to improve our Websites and our services.
In many cases, these tags/files lead to the use of your device's
processing or storage capabilities. Some of these tags/files are set by
NSF itself, others by third parties; some only last as long as your
browser session, while others can stay active on your device for a
longer period of time.
In particular, the technologies we use for automatic data collection may include:
Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small
file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to
accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your
browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access
certain parts of our Websites. Unless you have adjusted your browser
setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies
when you direct your browser to our Websites.
Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Websites
may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store
information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our
Websites. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as
are used for browser cookies.
Web Beacons. Pages of our Websites and our
e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also
referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that
permit NSF, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or
opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example,
recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system
and server integrity).
For information about managing your privacy and security settings for cookies, see Your Rights as a Data Subject.
These tags/files can fall into several categories: (i) those that
are necessary for functionality or services that you request or for the
transmission of communications (functionality tags/files); (ii) those
that we use to carry out performance and audience metrics regarding our
website (analytics tags/files) and (iii) the rest (tracking across a
network of other websites, advertising, etc.) (other tags/files).
Depending on applicable law, different rules may apply. Within the
European Union, for instance, functionality and analytical tags/files do
not require your consent. For analytical and other tags/files, however,
we request your consent before placing them on your device. You can
give your consent by allowing cookies in your browser settings, by
continuing to use our website, or by clicking on the appropriate button
on the banner displayed to you.
