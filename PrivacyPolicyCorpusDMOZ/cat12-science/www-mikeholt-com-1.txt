MikeHolt.com Newsletters and Code Forums are optional benefits for members that keep you

online. However, you may always decline to receive these email messages.

conduct
online surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all members. Typically, the

We do not sell individual customer names or other private profile information to third

What other information should I know about

MikeHolt.com contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one

responsibility.
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such sites as their policies may
be materially different from MikeHolt.com's Privacy Statement. Of course, you are solely
responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.
Please be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information, especially
whenever
you're online.
In addition to the circumstances described above, MikeHolt.com may disclose member
information
if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law
enforcement
authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or
advisable
including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of MikeHolt.com or
when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our
rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be
harmed by such activities.
Any material changes in the way MikeHolt.com uses personal information will be described
in future versions of this Privacy Statement. Of course, you may always submit concerns
regarding our Privacy Statement or our privacy practices to mike@mikeholt.com.
Please reference the privacy policy in your subject line. MikeHolt.com will attempt to
respond to all reasonable concerns or inquiries within five business days of receipt.
From what I have observed in my 35 year young life is that Mike Holt wants to teach you to be an
electrician
and has available information to do so, not just to get you to pass licensing tests.
