There is a separate document, which further details our privacy policy and governs our use of your personal information in using the web site.TERMS AND CONDITIONSTerms and conditions on using the BWI site. This information is for your protection as well as ours.Your use of this website and your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions then you are not authorised to use this website. You affirm your assent to the terms of this Agreement every time you access any part of the Site or make use of any of the Content. The following clauses cover a number of situations that the BWI deems as relevant to services provided on the web site.Users consent that in case of ambiguity the Croatian version of this legal document is the original version out of which all further interpretation is taken.DonationDonations received are regulated by Croatian Civil Obligations Act (Official Gazette 35/05, 41/08, 125/11, 78/15). According to the Act, donations are considered “a gift”. Hence, the BWI is not allowed to provide any form of service or goods in return. Donations can be given as a financial contribution, or as goods or services. According to the provisions of the Croatian Profit Tax Act (Official Gazette 177/04, 90/05, 57/06, 146/08, 80/10, 22/12, 148/13, 143/14, 50/16), a donation presents an expense (cost) for the donor and the amount donated can be used for profit tax deduction. Croatian tax law allows donations that cannot exceed 2% of income reported by the donor in the previous fiscal year. The amount can be larger if a relevant Ministry issues a permit/decision/instruction. Please inquire about legal amounts and other donation regulations in your country. In order to be able to issue a donation payment certificate, we need your tax ID or your personal ID (depending on what is used in your respective country). For large amounts, we would suggest contacting us and making a donation contract. Donations are non-refundable. Should you require more information please contact us at info@blue-world.org, call +385 51 604666 or fax +385 51 604668.“Adopt a dolphin” donation programThe BWI is a non-profit organisation. Much of its activities are funded through donations. Our supporters can make voluntary contributions in any amount or can participate in a donation program by making a symbolic dolphin adoption.Dolphin adoption is a voluntary donation program allowing physical or legal persons wishing to support the work of the BWI to do so. The adoption is symbolic and does not represent any form of ownership nor does it give any possibility to make any claim over any dolphin or any other animal or its part. Each dolphin adopter understands that donation is a voluntary act. In case you make a donation through dolphin adoption, you will receive an adoption pack made with the aim of public awareness raising. For details on donations, please see our Donation section [link].By making a Dolphin adoption payment, each donor (person making the payment) agrees to the following:The donor is at least 18 years old or has guidance or permission from a person that is 18 years old or older.The donor has the authorisation to use the payment method to make the donation.The BWI will use the received donation amount for its work in marine conservation and raising of public awareness.The BWI will provide the donor with a public awareness adoption pack consisting of items listed with the chosen adoption. The donor will pay the postage for the delivery of the adoption pack. Cost of postage is not considered part of a donation.If the adoption pack is not delivered, is damaged or is not the one you selected, we will replace the adoption pack. Please email us at info@blue-world.org, call +385 51 604666 or fax +385 51 604668 for help in processing your request. If the problem is down to a BWI fault, additional postage will be paid by BWI.Donors will not charge back, dispute or reverse any payments, nor will they request any goods or services from the BWI in exchange for the donation.The donor voluntarily donates the amount transferred to the BWI account. The amount visible on the BWI bank statement is considered as the donation amount and will be listed on the donation certificate. The full donation amount made in any foreign currency will be transferred to Croatian Kuna based on the exchange rate applied by the relevant bank/service on the day of transfer. In case a donation payment certificate is required, the amount will be presented in Croatian Kuna and the medium exchange rate of the BWI business bank will be used to present the amount in any other currency. Hence some differences in the amounts stated may occur.Dolphin adoption lasts for a period of 365 days, hence it may cover parts of two calendar years. The donation certificate can be used for tax deduction only once, in the calendar year in which the donation was made.Each donor will become a supporting member of the BWI and will receive a membership card giving free access to Lošinj Marine Education Centre in Veli Lošinj. Unless renewed, membership will cease within one year (365 days).Payment processing is done through payment gateways or services. The BWI does not take or process any debit/credit card and/or PayPal account details. The BWI will not be liable for any bank (or similar) charges incurred during payment process or due to any service failure or in case you did not ensure adequate monies are maintained in your account. Standard charges may apply at the rates applicable at the time of the transaction.The BWI aims to dispatch the dolphin adoption pack within five (5) working days of payment receipt, Monday to Friday, 8am – 3pm (Central European Time). However, to permit for all eventualities, please allow up to 28 days for delivery. Postage and packing is free to addresses in the Adriatic countries of Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, and Albania; additional €15 for all other overseas addresses.Your personal details needed for donation/dolphin adoption processing will be kept private and will not be made available to any third party unless legal order for disclosure is made.These terms can be changed and amended at any point by the BWI. All changes will become valid at the time of publishing.By making a payment the donator agrees to everything listed above.Any disputes will be resolved amicably. In case positive solution is not sought, the courts of Croatia are taking jurisdiction.If you do not agree with the terms listed above then please do not make a donation or dolphin adoption.REQUEST PROCESSINGAny e-mail, booking, payment or on-line form sent to the BWI is considered a request. The BWI aims to process any requests within five (5) working days of receipt Monday to Friday 8am- 3pm (Central European Time).
