University of Houston-Clear Lake is an educational institution with a distinct identity,
whose primary role is to provide fair and equitable learning opportunities to graduate
and undergraduate students. The university serves a diverse student population from
the state, the nation and abroad, particularly from the Houston-Galveston metropolitan
area, by offering programs on and off campus.
The university's faculty, staff and administrators are committed to providing a humane,
responsive and intellectually stimulating environment for productive learning and
working. UHCL emphasizes:
Learning through teaching, research, scholarship, and professional and community service
— the advancement of knowledge.
Delivery of educational opportunities through new instructional technologies and through
distance learning.
A commitment to high academic standards.
Sensitivity to the needs of the students and communities served by the institution
and, above all, integrity in all institutional functions.
Solving Problems
UHCL encourages informal resolution of complaints as the most effective solution to
problems. Before filing a formal complaint, individuals are encouraged to first discuss
the situation directly with the other person involved. If a resolution has not been
reached, they're encouraged to discuss the situation with the other person's supervisor.
Individuals needing assistance with directing their complaints or understanding the
proper procedures may consult with the Dean of Students.
Formal Complaint Process
Interface with UHCL customers occurs in three primary areas: Student Affairs, Academic
Affairs, and Administration & Finance. Complainants are invited to submit their complaints
in writing, in person, via email or by telephone to the appropriate office, or to
the university's customer service representative. Office names, on-campus building
locations, box numbers, telephone numbers and email addresses are given below for
offices in each of the three areas. Complaints in writing should be directed to the
appropriate office using the specific office title and box number in the following
address.
