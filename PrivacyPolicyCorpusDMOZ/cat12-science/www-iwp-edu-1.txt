By attending or registering for an IWP event, you signify your agreement to the policy below.
Attendance at all IWP events requires an RSVP in advance. If you purchased a ticket for an IWP event, these tickets are non-refundable. In addition, prospective attendees must receive an e-mail confirmation from IWP indicating that seating will be available for them at the event. IWP reserves the right to ask for a government-issued ID that matches your name on the confirmed attendee list. Please note that general seating for public events is on a first-come, first serve basis.
For events marked “US Citizens Only”: Only U.S. citizens will be admitted to such an event, and only after each has registered online in advance of the event beginning. The following forms of identification will be considered by IWP as proving citizenship: a valid U.S. Passport, a birth certificate proving birth in the U.S. (plus a photo ID), a U.S. Government issued Common Access Card (a CAC card), or a U.S. Certificate of Naturalization. These documents must be original copies. No exceptions will be made for failure to produce one of these documents.
At both in-person and online events, guests are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is courteous and respectful to their fellow event attendees and to the speaker. This might include ensuring that questions asked during the event are relevant to the topic at hand, respectful, concise, and asked at the appropriate time.
Some IWP lectures are held off the record. Media interested in covering an event may contact events@iwp.edu with inquiries one week in advance of the event. We reserve the right to refuse admission to press.
The use of photographic and/or recording equipment is prohibited except by advanced permission from IWP, the event organizer, and the speaker(s). This policy applies to both in-person event and online events/webinars. Please contact events@iwp.edu with any inquiries. IWP reserves the right to prohibit photographic and/or recording equipment, either in advance of, immediately before, or during an event.
The Institute’s dress code requires attire appropriate for a professional setting. This helps to ensure a positive learning environment and a climate conducive to respectful interaction.
The Institute of World Politics is not responsible for lost or stolen property.
IWP is a private organization; as such, all attendees are guests of the Institute.
The purpose of IWP events is to promote academic discourse on a variety of issues related to the subjects taught at our school. Please note that the views expressed by our guest lecturers do not necessarily reflect the views of The Institute of World Politics.
The Institute of World Politics reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deny admission to anyone who, while our guest and on the premises of the event, may not conduct themselves with the courtesy and decorum our organization requires or who otherwise violates this events policy. IWP reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to physically remove from the premises any person who is violating our standards of conduct or other elements of this events policy. The premises of the event shall be defined by The Institute of World Politics in consultation with the owner of the venue and local law enforcement. This policy applies to anyone who may attend the event without registering. This policy also applies to anyone who is responsible for bringing another person to the event who later violates this policy.
By registering for or attending this event, you agree that The Institute of World Politics assumes no liability for injury, damage, or loss which may be related in any way to its implementation of this policy.
Additional provisions to this policy may apply pursuant to our agreement with the owner of the facility of the event. Any person who is removed may be subject to arrest or detention by authorities for violation of this policy or the codes of the jurisdiction of the event. Nothing in this policy is designed to censor anyone’s speech or conduct on public property.
