Personal Information Defined
Oceana considers “Personal Information” to include information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number.

If you choose to make a donation or other activity that requires payment, we may also ask for information required for billing and shipment, such as your credit card number, card verification value code, billing address, phone number, and email address. Oceana will not share or sell a donor's personal information with anyone else, nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations; and Oceana will only share or sell personal information once the donor has given the charity specific permission to do so. This policy is applicable to both online and offline donors.
