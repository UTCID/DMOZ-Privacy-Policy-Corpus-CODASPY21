Terms of Service
Terms and conditions governing your use of the press release distribution and related service(s) (collectively, the “Service”):
1. Use
A. You are responsible for the content and accuracy of all news copy and other information submitted by you to Vocus PRW Holdings, LLC d/b/a PRWeb (“PRWeb”) or entered into the Service (the “Submitted Materials”) even if such copy has been reviewed, edited or written by PRWeb for you. Because of the volume of information and copy submitted to PRWeb, PRWeb cannot be responsible for verifying facts contained in Submitted Materials. All Submitted Materials must follow PRWeb’s editorial guidelines which can be found on PRWeb’s web site and are subject to change at any time at PRWeb’s sole discretion.
B. PRWeb reserves the right (i) to reject or edit Submitted Materials, provided that substantive edits to the Submitted Materials will not be done without your consent; and (ii) to remove any press release from its web site, pull any press release from distribution or deny approval to any press release. PRWeb can only remove Submitted Materials from its network, and PRWeb makes no representation or warranty regarding the removal of Submitted Materials from sites outside of the PRWeb network.
C. PRWeb endeavors to disseminate Submitted Materials promptly and accurately. Any inadvertent errors by PRWeb will be corrected promptly upon discovery, without additional charge, and such obligation to correct shall constitute the sole liability of PRWeb in this regard. If Submitted Material is not distributed within 30 days of the earlier of the (i) date on which you enter such material or (ii) pay for the Service (even if you have not yet entered Submitted Material) for reasons other than a delay caused solely by PRWeb, then PRWeb’s service to you concerning such Submitted Material and/or payment shall be considered complete, and PRWeb shall have no further obligation to you regarding such Submitted Material or in relation to such payment.
D. All Submitted Materials transmitted by PRWeb must contain a user-supplied contact name, phone number and e-mail address that may be verified by PRWeb.
E. PRWeb does not warrant specific placement of any news release nor pick up by third parties of any news release on its wire, but will deliver a news release via online distribution methods to make such content available to be repurposed by third parties who discover the content at various Internet locations, both intended and unintended.
F. You agree to use the Service for its intended purpose and not for any illicit purposes including, but not limited to, the reverse engineering of the site and/or its processes and the inclusion of such processes or services in a derivative service. You shall not query, spider or access any PRWeb systems without the express written consent of PRWeb.
2. Suspension, Termination
A. PRWeb may suspend or terminate your account at any time at its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your account becomes delinquent or you breach any material term or condition herein, then, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, PRWeb reserves the right to suspend your access to the Service, without liability to you.
3. Billing
A. You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. All payment obligations are noncancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable. You must provide PRWeb with valid credit card information to use the Service. PRWeb reserves the right to modify its fees and charges and to introduce new charges at any time.
B. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes based solely on PRWeb’s income. If you believe your bill is incorrect, you must contact us in writing within 60 days at the following address: Vocus PRW Holdings, LLC, Attn: Legal Dept., 12051 Indian Creek Ct., Beltsville, MD 20705.
C. You agree to provide PRWeb with complete and accurate billing and contact information. You agree to update this information within 30 days of any change to it. If the contact information you have provided is false or fraudulent, PRWeb reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service in addition to any other legal remedies.
D. Unless otherwise agreed to by PRWeb, amounts will be billed in U.S. dollars.
4. Warranties; Limitation of Liability
A. You represent and warrant to PRWeb that (i) you have the right to deliver the Submitted Materials to PRWeb, (ii) you will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and laws relating to “spam”, (iii) Submitted Materials will not contain any content that is obscene, libelous, slanderous or otherwise defamatory, false or misleading or which violates any copyright, right of privacy or publicity or other right of any person; and (iv) Submitted Materials will not contain any viruses, scripts, macros, or programs or links to macros, scripts, programs, or any code that alters, destroys, infiltrates or inhibits the operation of computer systems including, but not limited to the Service or data stored within such computer systems including, but not limited to the Service.
B. PRWEB MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND TITLE, AND ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE), REGARDING THE SERVICE. PRWEB DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS, INCLUDING OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS, LOSSES OR DEFECTS, WHETHER HUMAN OR MECHANICAL.
C. PRWeb’s entire liability for damages for any claims arising under or in connection with your use of the Service, regardless of the cause of action, whether in contract or in tort (including without limitation, breach of warranty and negligence claims) shall be limited to your actual direct damages, not to exceed the amounts actually paid by you for your use of the Service during the twelve months immediately preceding the month in which the cause of action arose. IN NO EVENT SHALL PRWEB HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DEMANDS OF THIRD PARTIES OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
5. Indemnification
A. PRWeb will indemnify (“Indemnitor”) and hold you (“Indemnitee”) harmless against any claim or demand by a third party, including without limitation reasonable attorney’s fees, alleging that the Service infringes any intellectual property right under the laws of the United States of a third party. This indemnification does not cover third party claims arising from: (i) modifications to the Service by anyone other than PRWeb or its authorized agents and contractors; (ii) use of the Service by you in combination with other software or equipment not authorized by PRWeb where the Service, if not so used, would not be infringing; or (iii) your failure to use the Service in accordance with these terms and conditions.

You shall indemnify (“Indemnitor”) and hold harmless PRWeb (“Indemnitee”), its affiliated companies and its third party vendors, including distributors, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or relating to any breach by you of any representations and/or warranties contained herein or otherwise arising out of or relating to the Submitted Materials.
C. Indemnification is conditioned upon the following: (i) the Indemnitee promptly notifying the Indemnitor of any claim; (ii) the Indemnitor having sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) the Indemnitee cooperating, at the Indemnitor’s expense, in the defense and furnishing the Indemnitor with all related evidence in its control.
D. If a claim regarding the Service and alleging infringement is brought or is likely, in PRWeb’s sole opinion, to be brought, PRWeb may, at its sole option and expense (i) obtain the right for you to continue using the Service; (ii) replace or modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or (iii) upon notice to you, terminate your use of the Service or any portion thereof, provided that Vocus promptly refunds to you the prorated portion of any pre-paid fees paid hereunder.
