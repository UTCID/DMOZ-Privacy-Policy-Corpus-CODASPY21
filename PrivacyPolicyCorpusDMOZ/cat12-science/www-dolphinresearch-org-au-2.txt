Terms and Conditions
The Dolphin Research Institute (DRI) endeavours to provide a professional and timely response to all of our supporters needs.
We aim to maintain accurate and factual content in all communications and welcome feedback so that we can improve all aspects of our work and the materials we present.
We aim to respond to supporters within five working days of receiving an inquiry, order or donation. We are a lean not-for-profit organisation and we hope that supporters will understand if occasionally delays beyond this are experienced. It is helpful to let us know if you need to meet a special date like a birthday for an Adopt-A-Dolphin.
DRI believes in building positive and long-term relationships with our supporters and will commit to ensuring that expectations are met or exceeded if at all possible. We will work with supporters who feel that we have not met their expectations, with a fundraising vehicle or merchandise item, to provide a replacement or refund where appropriate.
Please contact DRI if you have any concerns, on:
Phone: 03 5979 7100
Fax: 03 5979 7150
Email: DRI Admin
Mail: PO Box 77, HASTINGS, VIC. 3915, Australia.
