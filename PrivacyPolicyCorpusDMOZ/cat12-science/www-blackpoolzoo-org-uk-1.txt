Blackpool Zoo Full Legal Statement regarding the Reopening & Operation of the Zoo during Covid-19
We have been intensively preparing for a re-opening of the Zoo in close cooperation with the authorities. Health and safety of our staff and visitors has always been our highest priority. It is our goal that you continue to feel safe and comfortable when visiting us.
We have conducted a Covid Secure Risk Assessment and implemented measures to reduce the risk of transmission. We have implemented government guidelines regarding the reopening of Zoos and the recommendations of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) who have worked closely with UK Government and DEFRA to publish guidelines for opening zoos and aquariums under Covid-19 Restrictions.
The Zoo will begin to reopen in a way that incorporates enhanced health and safety measures, including increased cleaning procedures, the use of appropriate protection equipment by both employees, limited-contact guest services and additional health and safety training for employees.
There will also be multiple hand washing points and hand sanitizer stations throughout the Zoo and visitors must use them regularly and as directed. As we continue to monitor conditions, and with the health of visitors and staff at the forefront of our planning, we may adapt or change the operational measures with the aim of a constant enhancement of visitor and staff health. The Zoo will have limitations on overall attendance, exhibit and attraction capacity, parking and attraction use.
Notwithstanding open spaces such as our Zoo are of low risk for the transmission of Covid19, there remains an inherent risk of exposure in any public place where people are present which cannot be entirely eliminated.  Covid-19 is a contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. Consequently, it is imperative that all those visiting the Zoo behave responsibly and respect the measures that we have put in place. Please do not visit the Zoo if you are experiencing symptoms of Covid19 or have any underlying health conditions or are otherwise vulnerable in any way that may put you at risk. In the absence of any negligence or breach of duty by us, visiting the Zoo is entirely at your risk.
IMPORTANT: Here's what to know before you go. Please read.
Based on the additional measures and procedures, we ask for visitors’ understanding of and compliance with the following requirements*:
We kindly request that you ensure you are in good health condition before visiting the Zoo. Visitors who have been in contact with a person infected with Covid-19 in the last 14 days or show symptoms of Covid-19, or have been identified by track and trace, must postpone their visit to the Zoo and follow latest UK Government regulations regarding self-isolation. We recommend you do not to visit the Zoo if you or anyone who lives with you is in the high risk or vulnerable category.
Groups of visitors will be restricted to a maximum of six individuals. If the group is not all from the same household or support bubble, they must comply with the social distancing requirements issued by their local authority relating to meeting others outside.
Online purchase of entry tickets in advance will be the primary method for purchasing a ticket. On site sales will be limited and subject to availability.
Visitors purchasing a ticket online (subject to availability) will be required to show a valid ticket and reservation for the date of visit upon arrival.
Annual Pass holders will be required to book their visit in advance online subject to availability. They will be required to show their valid pass and valid reservation to access the Zoo.
Third party ticket holders, TESCO Club Card vouchers and holders of open tickets will be required to book their visit in advance online subject to availability. They will be required to show their valid ticket and reservation to access the Zoo.
Some areas of the Zoo will be closed. Please see below for a full list of these.
It is mandatory to wear a face covering in the majority of indoor areas of Blackpool Zoo unless you declare that you have a government listed exemption. Please ensure you bring a face covering with you on your visit or you can purchase one from us. You may be refused admission if you attempt to visit Blackpool Zoo or enter a relevant indoor area without a face covering and don’t declare an exemption.
Your details will be taken for Government test and trace. Your name, phone number, time and date of visit will be kept on record for 21 days. Please see our privacy policy on our website for further information on how we store and use your data.
IMPORTANT: Zoo Operational Changes: Areas Closed. Please Read.
Our primary concern is your safety. In order to comply with public health regulations and recommendations, the following areas and facilities will remain closed. Please read the facility closures information below before buying your tickets. By purchasing tickets and reserving a visit slot you acknowledge and accept the closure of the areas mentioned below and updated when relevant.
The catering offer will be limited to a small amount of takeaway kiosks only. No indoor catering outlets will be available.
There will be no talks, feeds, displays or animal experiences.

IMPORTANT: Here's what to know upon arrival and during your visit to the Zoo. Please read.
It is mandatory to wear a face covering in the majority of indoor areas of Blackpool Zoo unless you declare that you have a government listed exemption. Please ensure you bring a face covering with you on your visit or you can purchase one from us. You may be refused admission if you attempt to visit Blackpool Zoo or enter a relevant indoor area without a face covering and don’t declare an exemption. We remind visitors that it is mandatory to wear them on any public transportation you may use to travel to and from the Zoo. Our staff will be wearing face mask/coverings.
Card payments will be the primary payment method available and we strongly encourage contactless payment for all purchases up to £45.
It is mandatory to use disinfection and sanitation products before entering the Zoo and at regular intervals during your visit. Hand sanitizers and hand washing facilities will be available throughout the Zoo and be clearly identifiable along with instructions on the correct use.
Please pay attention to the social distance rule and keep, at least, 1m from other visitors who are not part of your household or support bubble throughout your stay. Our Zoo area is large and spacious which means there is enough space for all visitors to keep the mandatory minimum social distance but there is an obvious personal responsibility in doing so which we ask you to strictly follow.  You will find clear information and floor markers will be available. Busy areas in the Zoo may have additional social distancing regulations in place.
One way routes have been installed where necessary to maintain social distancing and you must follow them where indicated.
You may be required to queue for a while to access the Zoo initially and some popular exhibits and attractions where we need to limit capacity. Please follow all queue management systems and adhere to staff instructions.
Should you feel unwell during your visit, with symptoms compatible with Covid-19, please avoid contact with other visitors and seek immediate medical attention.
Always carry tissues and use them to catch any cough or sneeze. Please dispose of the tissue immediately in one of our waste bins and clean your hands as soon as possible thereafter. If you do not have a tissue available please sneeze or cough into your elbow.
Please respect in all instances, instructions from Zoo personnel and obey all written and oral warnings. Visitors who do not comply with these rules may be ejected from the Zoo without refund. We will not tolerate and verbal or physical abuse to our staff members or other visitors.
Given this unprecedented situation, we appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we navigate through this process as responsibly as we can.

Access to information
The Data Protection Act 1998 (prior to 25th May 2018) and the GDPR (on or after 25th May 2018) gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the DP Law.
Rectification
The GDPR gives you the right to require your personal data held by GLG to be rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with procedures stated in the GDPR.
Erasure
The GDPR gives you the right to ask GLG to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for GLG continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask GLG to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where GLG may have processed your information unlawfully or where GLG are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that GLG may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Data portability
The GDPR gives you the right to obtain and relocate your personal data held by GLG to another IT environment. If you notify GLG that you wish to exercise this right, GLG will arrange the transfer in machine readable form to another IT environment within one month if it is technically possible, or within two months if the transfer is complex or if there have been multiple requests.
Restriction on Processing
The GDPR gives you the right to ask GLG to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want GLG to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where GLG’s use of the data is unlawful but you do not want GLG to erase it; (c) where you need GLG to hold the data even if GLG no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to GLG’s use of your data but GLG will need to verify whether it has overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Objecting to Processing
The GDPR allows you to object to the processing of your personal data where GLG are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where GLG are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, GLG may demonstrate that it has compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Automated decision making
You also have the right under the GDPR in some circumstances not to be the subject of a decision based on automated processing or profiling which produces a legal effect or other significant effect on you. If you wish to exercise this right, you should make an objection in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, GLG may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, GLG may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Time limit to respond
GLG try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take GLG longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, GLG will notify you and keep you updated.
Changes to the privacy policy
Any changes GLG may make to its privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to the privacy policy.

Blackpool Zoo is now open!
We are in Tier 3 rules so we are unable to open indoor viewing areas of our animal houses or indoor seating areas – but stick your wellies on, dig out your woollies, wrap up warm and enjoy plenty of fresh air as you explore the zoo.
We are really looking forward to welcoming you all back!!
A full list of restrictions and measures in place can be found here.  Please ensure you read them before you book your tickets as they are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.
