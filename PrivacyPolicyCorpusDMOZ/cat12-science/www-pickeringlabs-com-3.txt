We use Google Drive to store our newsletter email list and Google Analytics to analyze traffic data on our websites (https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/#?modal_active=none).
Salesforce helps Pickering Labs build and manage sales leads, customer lists, technical support issue resolutions and marketing strategies (https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/).

We do not collect or maintain credit card or checking account information online.
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
IP addresses are collected and used to determine your country of origin. If you are an international visitor looking to purchase products online, our websites will automatically redirect you to a list of our international distributors.
Our security software logs email and IP addresses of detected spammers. This information is used to block them from spamming our blog and forms.
7. How Long We Retain Your Data
The following describes some of the data types we collect and the length of time we retain that information:
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register or create an account on our websites, we will store your personal information in a user profile online and/or offline. You can review, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except you cannot change your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
All financial transaction information (credit card, checking, etc.) is processed and managed by Chase Bank (https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security). Pickering Labs does not store or manage credit card or checking information online. After the sales transaction is transferred to Chase Bank for processing, there is no online record of account information.
We keep paper copies of sales transactions for at least 5 years and up to 6 years before they are physically destroyed.  These transactions may contain email addresses and phone numbers along with shipping and billing addresses.
We keep electronic accounting records indefinitely for active accounts in our Adagio accounting software on our onsite server.  Customer accounts can be inactivated and individual/personal data can be removed such as email addresses and phone numbers, which effectively keep the company’s transaction history but removes personal data.  Invoices paid by credit or debit card may have electronic record of the account number stored in the individual transaction data.  Credit card numbers are not maintained in customer accounts unless explicitly requested by customer.
Our security software logs email and IP addresses of detected spammers. We keep this information indefinitely to block them from spamming our blog and forms.

8. What Rights You Have Over Your Data
If you register on pickeringlabs.com in order to leave blog post comments or to shop for our products and services online, we will store your personal information in a user profile where you can see, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except that you may not be able to change your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
Pickeringtestsolutions.com does not require a user profile for purchases and has no blog, so no online user registrations are needed. Online sales data is inputted, printed by the customer, and sent to Pickering Labs’ customer service via email.
If you have requested information, left comments, asked to be added to our mail list, or if you have created an account or user profile, you can request for Pickering Labs to provide a readout of your personal data, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we delete your personal data from our systems. This does not include any data we are obligated to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
You can manage your profile and email preferences, including “opting out” of email. Please see our “Contact Us” section below for more information.
9. California Privacy Right

If applicable, this information would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal information during the prior 12 months.
