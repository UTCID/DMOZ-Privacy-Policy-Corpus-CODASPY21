Use of Cookies

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize FCT pages, or register with FCT site or services, a cookie helps FCT to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
