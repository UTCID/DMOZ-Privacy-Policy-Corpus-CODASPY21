Privacy Policy
Our Commitment to Privacy
CASLT is committed to ensuring the accuracy, confidentiality, integrity, and security of all personal information. Our responsibility for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information provided by our members is an important tenet in our organization.
We use the term “personal” to describe information that identifies an individual, such as home address, home telephone number, credit card information, member identification number, or password. Publicly available information, such as information on a business card or on a LinkedIn profile (name, job title, business address, business telephone, and work email address), is not considered personal information.
Collection and Use of Personal Information
We often communicate with members regarding our activities, products, and services, as well as during membership recruitment campaigns. We collect and use personal information to provide the programs and services members have requested from us, or for the purposes set out in this policy.
Your own personal information is used to communicate with you about your membership in CASLT and the services that we provide. We may contact you to conduct surveys in our continual effort to improve our services.
We will only ask for information that we need and only when we need it. When we ask, we will explain why we need it and what we are going to do with it. We will seek your prior consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of the information as required by applicable privacy legislation.
Please note that by becoming a member of CASLT, you agree that we will collect, use, and disclose information about you. Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse to consent. You may also withdraw your consent to any further collection, use, or disclosure of information about you at any time. If our intended disclosures or uses of information change, we will notify you accordingly.
Information that does not identify individuals, collected through surveys, existing files, and public archives, may be used by CASLT to analyze its markets and to develop or enhance member services.
Disclosure
To enable us to provide the services that members have requested from us more efficiently, CASLT may share personal information with selected third parties acting on our behalf as our contractors, suppliers, or service providers. Such third-party service providers only receive such information as is necessary in the circumstances. Information provided to third parties may be used only for the purpose stipulated and is subject to strict terms of confidentiality.
Accuracy
We commit to ensuring that the information we hold about you is as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as possible. When your personal information changes, please make sure to update your member profile on CASLT’s website.
Security
We are committed to protecting your privacy. Security measures such as locked cabinets, restricted access, passwords, and encryption have been adopted to protect your personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, etc. Employees with access shall use your personal information only in strict accordance with the CASLT Privacy Policy and the laws applicable.
Questions or Concerns
We will be happy to respond to inquiries or complaints about CASLT’s handling of personal information. If you have questions about the collection, use, disclosure, or security of your personal information, or if you simply want to know whether we have any of your personal information on file, please contact our membership administrator at 1-877-727-0994 or This email address is being protected from spambots.
