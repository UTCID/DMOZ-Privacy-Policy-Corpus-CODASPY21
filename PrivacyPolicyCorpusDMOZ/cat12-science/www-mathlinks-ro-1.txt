Art of Problem Solving Privacy Policy
AOPS INCORPORATED PRIVACY POLICY - EFFECTIVE September 23, 2020
This Privacy Policy applies to all users. Please click here for our specific information practices with
regards to children under 13 (also provided at the end of this policy).
We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only
collect the information necessary to provide our services efficiently.
Users using our online community or other online resources
requiring membership
To post information in a forum, to use some of our online educational
tools, or to attend online classes, you must become a member of the Art
of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal
information we require is your email address and a username that you select.
The username that you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you;
it is strongly recommended that it not be your real name, but a pseudonym.
You will also select a password, which is needed to log on. We do ask about
your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none
of this information is required for membership in the Community.
Your email address is used by us to send messages to you. We do so to
confirm your username and password if you should forget your username
or password. We also use your email address to assist in administering
our web site and to help enforce our conduct rules (for example,
people who post offensive messages in the forum can be banned). Should
you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email
address will be used for communication purposes for that class. We
will not send solicitation emails collected as part of the Art of
Problem Solving Community unless the user elects to join our mailing
lists. We will not share your email address with third parties except
when needed for the operation of our mailing list (for which the
third party is ActiveCampaign, LLC) or when required by law.
Our site has forums (message boards), private messaging, and real-time
discussion available to its members. Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas is potentially available
to other members and in some cases to the general public. You should
not disclose any personal information, such as your real name,
address, telephone number, email address, etc. Your username is the
only identity that you need to have, and that is how people should
know you on our site.
We may disclose data we collect from Community members to a third party
for educational research, business, and other purposes. Such data will never contain any
personally identifiable information, and will not allow a third party to identify any
individual user.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a small piece of data placed on your computer by us.
Within your web browser, cookies placed by our website can only be
accessed by our website. We use cookies to
maintain session and preference information to improve the use of the website.
We do not use cookies to target advertisements to specific users. You may set
your web browser to decline our
cookies, however this will render large portions of our website
unusable.
We also allow cookies to be placed on your computer by third parties
for the purpose of website analytics. This allows the third parties to
collect data about your use of our website. The data collected by these cookies may include
information such as your IP address or mobile identifier, the type of
computer operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the
user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information
regarding the online or mobile service provider. This data is not used to target
advertisements to specific users. We don't share the data that a
third party collects with anyone besides that third party.
The third parties are required to not share any personally identifiable
information they may collect with anyone other than us (except as may be
required by law). We use the data that is collected in the following
ways:
to report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use
our website;
to understand overall visitor behavior; and
to inform how we update and improve our website.
Teachers using our Teacher Tools
Teachers using our Teacher Tools on our website must first be
members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We collect certain
additional information from teachers wishing to use the Teacher
Tools. We collect: your name, your school's name and address, a
contact phone number and email address, and your school's website URL.
We use this information to verify that you are a teacher at a
legitimate educational institution or homeschool, and to contact you
regarding the Teacher Tools. We may request from you other proof of
school affiliation, as necessary, to determine your eligibility to use
our Teacher Tools. We will not share this information with any third
party (except as may be required by law).
Teachers may enroll
students in their classes using the Teacher Tools. In the case
that such a student is under the age of 13, teachers agree that they,
or their school, are acting as the students' parents' agent in
providing consent for the online collection of students' personal
information within the school context. (Please see
this website from the Federal Trade Commission
for more information.) Please note that we will only use children's
information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
Students enrolling in a class within their
school, established by a registered teacher using our Teacher Tools
Students who enroll in a class set up by a registered teacher
using our Teacher Tools
do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We
will collect your name, and you will also have to choose a unique
username and password, which are both needed to log on. (If you are
already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
your already-existing username and password, but you may have to
additionally provide your real name.) Your real name and username,
along with other data that we have collected including (but not
necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our
Alcumus online educational system, will be shared with the teacher in
whose class you are enrolling. We will not use this information for any other purpose,
and will not share this information with any other third party (except
as may be required by law). Please note that we will only use children's
information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
Coaches using our Contest Platform
Coaches using our Contest Platform on our website must first be members of the Art
of Problem Solving community. Coaches may invite students to participate in contests
in the Contest Platform. In the case that such a student is under the age of 13, coaches
that are school representatives agree that they, or their school, have authority to act on
behalf of the student and are providing consent on behalf of the parent/guardian for the
collection of the student’s personal information for a school-authorized educational purpose.
(Please see
this website from the Federal Trade Commission
for more information.)
Students participating in contests on our Contest Platform
Students participating in contests that are invited by a school representative coach
to use our Contest Platform do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community.
In addition to the other information described herein, we will collect your name and other
information required for participating in the contest that may include grade, age, parent contact
information, proctor contact information, gender and ethnicity information, address, email, and
consent for the contest organization to share your information with other educational institutions
& organizations. You will also have to choose a unique username and password, which are both
needed to log on. (If you are already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
your already-existing username and password.)
Your real name and username, along with other data that we have collected including (but not
necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our Contest Platform, will be shared
with your coach and the third-party contest organization who is operating the contest.
We will not
use this information for any other purpose, and will not share this information with any other third
party, except as may be required by law and as outlined herein.
Customers purchasing a product or service
We collect certain information from a customer who is purchasing a
product and/or service using our online ordering system. Such
information may include: your name, your shipping address, your
billing address, your credit card information, your email address, and
your phone number. This information is used to process your purchase
and to contact you if there is an issue with your purchase. We will
share this information with our credit card payment processor.
Additionally, your name, shipping address, email address, and/or phone
number may be shared with the United States Postal Service or other
private carrier, for the purpose of delivering any purchased goods to
your shipping address. We will store all of this information on our
secure server, except for your credit card information, which is only
retained until your payment has been processed and is not stored
thereafter; however, this information may be retained by our credit
card processor for the purpose of processing additional transactions,
refunds, and/or chargebacks. We
will not use this information for any purpose other than to process
your purchase, and will not share this information with any other
third party, except as described above or as may be required by law.
We may use your email address for marketing purposes, but only if you
give your permission to do so during the purchasing process, and such
permission may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us (via the
methods listed under "Contact Information" below).
Security
We implement commercially reasonable security methods to protect the
information we collect from you. While the security of your personal
information is of the utmost importance to us, we cannot absolutely
guarantee the security of any information you choose to disclose.

Disclaimer of other sites' practices
Our site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of other such sites.
Effective date and notice of future changes
This Privacy Policy is effective September 23, 2020. This Privacy Policy
may be updated from time to time as necessary.
COPPA Policy
The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires
that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use,
or disclosure of personal information from children under the age of 13, and to
obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any
such information. If we discover we have collected information from a child in a
manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either seek the parent's
consent for that collection or delete the information. We won't require a child
to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an
activity.
1. Information we collect and share
When we use the term "children" or "child", it refers to individuals under the age
of 13. We may collect and share the following personal information with verifiable
parental consent (where necessary under COPPA) from children:
(a) Children may provide us their email address during registration or as part of
receiving our services. We may use this email address to communicate directly with the
child. 	If the child joins one of our email lists, their email address
will be shared with the third party (ActiveCampaign, LLC) we use to manage our email lists.
We will not otherwise share an email
address with a third party except when required by law.
(b) A username used to uniquely identify each child is created during
registration. This username may be
disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online
classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may
participate. Other members of the website may use the child's
username to directly contact the child (for example, by private
message or in online classroom discussions).
(c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name.
The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be
disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific
authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has
requested access from the child to view the child's online school
reports or a coach overseeing the child’s participation in a contest you
have authorized to access your contest results. Such third parties must
request permission from us before
they request this information from the child, and we make a
reasonable effort to determine if the third party has your consent and their request is
legitimate before granting such permission. The child's real name
will never be made publicly available on our website by us.
(d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's
participation on the website; for example, online homework submissions,
live classroom discussions, etc. These data may be combined or associated
with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site, at
the child's or parent's discretion.
(e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal
information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on
a blog or in our online classroom). Such information may be publicly
displayed on the website alongside the child's username. We strongly discourage
users from sharing personal information, but we cannot prevent it in every
instance. This policy addresses how parents can delete information posted by
their children in item #2 below.
(f)
When children use our websites, certain information may automatically be
collected by third parties: IP address or mobile identifier, the type of computer
operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits
various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online
or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such
as cookies, which are described above.
This data is primarily collected and shared with third parties for internal
purposes, in order to:
report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use our website;
understand overall visitor behavior; and
inform how we update and improve our website.
The third-party operators who may collect information for these purposes
on our sites and applications are Alphabet Inc., Microsoft, Facebook, and Hotjar.
This information
is not used to target advertising to specific users.
For any questions about how we or any third-party uses your data, please do
not hesitate to contact us.
Our contact information is provided below in item #3.
(g)
Children using our site may participate in contests hosted on the AoPS Contest
Platform for a third-party organization responsible for operating the contest (“Contest
Organization”).
These users are directed to AoPS by the Contest Organization.
Information
collected for registration in the contest may include your child’s real name, grade, age,
parent contact information (e.g., email and address), proctor contact information, and
optional gender and ethnicity information.
This information will be shared with your
child’s contest coach and the Contest Organization.
(h) We may disclose a child’s personal information if permitted or required by law, for
example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
(i) We generally do not collect personal information from a child until we have received
verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA. There are limited instances where we
may collect information without parental consent in compliance with COPPA, including:
An email address is collected from a child at the time of registration, solely to
contact the child's parent in order to obtain the necessary parental consent;
To protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology; and
A username is selected by the child; however, this username cannot be used to contact
the child, nor be used for the purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of above, unless
and until we receive verifiable parental consent.
2. Parental rights and responsibilities
At any time, a parent can review or ask us to delete a child's
personal information, or can refuse to permit its further collection
or use, by contacting us by any of the means listed in item #3 below.
Parents may also access their child’s personal information by logging
onto their account and can delete their child’s personal information.
Parents
will need their child’s username and password, and our login page explains how
parents can recover a username or password if they cannot recall this information.
3. Contact information
Questions or comments about this policy, or requests pursuant
to item #2 above, may be sent to:
