INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
NASBR considers the information contained in presentations to be the property of the authors. To limit potential distractions during presentations and unauthorized dissemination of others’ work, the Board of Directors requests registrants to refrain from taking photographs or video of oral or poster presentations during sessions at the annual conference. We encourage audience members to contact the author to request further information about their presentation.
ALCOHOL POLICYNASBR encourages all participants to enjoy the social and evening activities but to drink in a responsible manner. Please note that, as a part of the contract with the hotel, no alcohol may be brought into any of the NASBR social events, including the Banquet Dinner.
ONLINE COMMENT POLICY
(enacted by the NASBR BOD on November 9, 2016):
NASBR is committed to ensuring that all online conversations are civil. In all our forums, we monitor comments either before they are published or shortly thereafter.
We never discriminate against any views, but we reserve the right to delete any of the following:
violent, obscene, profane, hateful, or racist comments,
comments that threaten or defame any person, group or organization,
comments that suggest or encourage illegal activity,
commercial advertisements,
several off-topic posts by a single user,
repetitive posts copied and pasted by multiple users, and
personal information such as e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or mailing addresses.
Egregious or repeated violations of the comment policy may result in deletion of your comment, removal from the group, or the reporting of your account to third-party site administrators.
ONE PRESENTATION POLICY
Each registrant is only allowed to be the presenting author on one presentation (either poster or oral). A registrant may be a coauthor and any number of presentations. A presenting author that cancels registration may not have a coauthor present their paper unless that person is a paid registrant and is not already doing a presentation. The Presentation Schedule will be posted on this website when it is finalized (this may take several weeks beyond the abstract deadline). Unless you hear otherwise from the Program Directors, you may assume that your abstract will be accepted as submitted (Oral or Poster, Student Honors if requested).
ABSTRACT ACCEPTANCE POLICY
NASBR will accept submitted abstracts in the order they are received. Every effort will be made to include all submitted abstracts in the program. However, if the program fills, those submitting last may be asked to present posters even if their first choice was an oral presentation. We encourage all registrants considering a presentation to submit their abstracts early and not wait until the submission deadline. When submitting an abstract you will be asked whether you wish to present as a poster or an oral format. Please note that this is an indication of preference only, and the Program Directors will make the final decision on presentation format to best create sessions that are thematic and flow well.
NASBR PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: January 14, 2020
Summary: The North American Society for Bat Research (NASBR) sometimes collects personal data from users of our website and from members. We use personal data for internal purposes related to communicating with members and organizing the annual meeting of the society, and only share that information with third parties as required to conduct society business (e.g., processing credit card payments, website analytics). The program of the annual conference includes contact information of registrants, but members may opt-out of this at the time of conference registration. The NASBR website includes a directory of members (https://www.nasbr.org/directory; accessible only to members), and members can update their privacy options in the My Profile section of the website (https://www.nasbr.org/sys/profile). If you have any questions or concerns about the collection, storage, or sharing of personal data, please contact us via our website (https://www.nasbr.org/Contact).

Examples include information for use in the “Lunch with a Bat Biologist” mentor program, or in post-conference feedback surveys (but note responses to post-conference surveys are collected anonymously). In future we may use anonymous surveys to collect age, ethnic background, interests, household income, or other demographic information.

We reserve the right to disclose Personal Data as legally required, or if we receive a request from a law enforcement agency that we believe is made in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements, protect the rights or property of NASBR, prevent a crime, or protect the personal safety of users or the public.

Some members may provide data from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA).

7.	Your rights under the GDPR with regard to your Personal Data
Under the GDPR, EU-based visitors and members have the rights to request from us access to Personal Data we store about you, to amend (or rectify) this data, to restrict our processing of the Personal Data, to erase the data, and to receive a copy of the data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (data portability). If you wish to invoke a right under the GDPR, you may contact us through the contact page of our website (https://www.nasbr.org/Contact). Your message should include a sufficiently detailed description of the GDPR right with which you seek assistance. We may contact you for further information and reserve the right to charge a fee for certain requests. NASBR will notify you if your request has been granted or declined, or if exemptions apply. If you have provided consent for the processing of your data, you have the right (in certain circumstances) to withdraw that consent at any time, which will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you believe that we have not complied with the requirements of the GDPR with regard to your Personal Data.
