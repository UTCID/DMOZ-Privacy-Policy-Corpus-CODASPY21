PRIVACY POLICYThe IUSSP collects data on its members through the IUSSP membership application form and profile pages. The IUSSP uses this data to communicate directly with members as well as  to better provide benefits and services to the membership. Some of this information is also displayed in the Membership directory. Aside from some basic contact  information, which is required, members can choose which additional information they wish to provide. Members may go to the IUSSP website and identify what information is displayed. They can also choose not to appear in the Membership directory. If they so wish, former members may opt to have all their personal information deleted from the membership database by contacting us at contact@iussp.org. Note that once this option is chosen, no records of a membership history will remain, nor can they be restored! The IUSSP does not sell any membership information to third parties. The IUSSP  website does not track, collect or distribute personal information about visitors. We do, however, regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the number of visitors to our website, the requests we receive for particular information on the website, and the Internet service providers (ISPs) that those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used by  IUSSP technical support staff to improve the website in an on-going effort to provide better information and services to the members and the public. The IUSSP does collect information when users and members  upload or edit content. We  monitor new user-posted content to ensure that objectionable content is not posted to the website and we  reserve the right to edit or restrict any user content posted to the site. IUSSP only uses credit card information to process payments authorized by its members. Credit card information is collected online through a secured payment system managed by Crédit Mutuel-CIC p@iement which provides a secure transaction site for all credit card payments. IUSSP does not receive or store any credit card information on its website or servers; member’s  credit card information is entered directly on the bank’s website.
