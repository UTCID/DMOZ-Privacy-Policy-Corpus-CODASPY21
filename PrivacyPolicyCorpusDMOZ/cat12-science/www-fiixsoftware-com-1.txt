If You do not provide notice of non-renewal of Your subscription for the Service by the applicable time period specified in Section 10.1 for Your Subscription Term (i.e. monthly, annual or multi-yearly), then the relevant fees for the renewal of Your subscription to the Service for a new subscription having the same Subscription Term will be automatically processed and charged to You in full at the then-current fees for the Service for such renewed Subscription Term.
4.5 Fee Changes. Fiix may change the fees Fiix charges for the Service and Professional Services at any time in Fiix’s discretion.

4.6 Suspension of Service. If Your account is five (5) or more days overdue in the case of a monthly Subscription Term or fifteen (15) or more days overdue in the case of an annual or multi-year Subscription Term, then in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, Fiix shall have the right to suspend provision of the Service to You without liability until such amounts are paid in full.

Subscription Term and Termination.
10.1 Term of these Terms. Service subscriptions purchased by You will entitle You to use the Service for the Subscription Term(s) set forth in Your Pricing Agreement and/or Your Quote(s) or applicable Order(s). Service subscriptions may be purchased for monthly, annual or multi-year Subscription Terms and such Subscription Terms are renewable as follows: (i) for a monthly Subscription Term – for an additional month commencing at the end of Your current monthly Subscription Term provided that neither You nor Fiix has provided notice of non-renewal at least two (2) days prior to the end of Your then-current monthly Subscription Term; (ii) for an annual Subscription Term – for an additional one (1) year period commencing at the end of Your current annual Subscription Term provided that neither You nor Fiix has provided notice of non-renewal at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of Your then-current annual Subscription Term; and (iii) for multi-year Subscription Term – for the same multi-year period as Your current multi-year Subscription Term commencing at the end of Your current multi-year Subscription Term provided that neither You nor Fiix has provided notice of non-renewal at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of Your then-current multi-year Subscription Term. These Terms will commence on the date of Your acceptance of the first Quote for the Service issued by Fiix to You, the date of Fiix’s acceptance of Your first Order for the Service or the effective date of Your Pricing Agreement incorporating these Terms, whichever occurred earlier, and shall continue thereafter for as long as You have an active Subscription Term (which period shall constitute the “Term” of these Terms).
10.2 Termination by You. You may terminate these Terms (including all of Your then-current Subscription Terms) and all of Your rights to use the Service by emailing Fiix at support@fiixsoftware.com with Your termination request. Termination will occur once Fiix has disabled Your ability to access and use the Service (which Fiix will do within two (2) business days of receipt of Your termination request). Your termination will not entitle You to any refunds.
10.3 Termination or Suspension by Fiix. Without limiting other remedies Fiix may have, Fiix may limit, suspend, or terminate Your use of the Service, prohibit Your access to the Service and/or delete Your User account(s) for the Service, without prior notice, if You are in arrears in Your payment for the Service by (i) more than five (5) days for monthly Subscription Terms, or (ii) more than fifteen (15) days for annual or multi-year Subscription Terms. Fiix shall also be entitled to terminate these Terms (including all of Your Subscription Term(s)) and Your rights to access and use the Service if You are: in breach of these Terms; creating problems in respect to the operation of the Service; creating legal liabilities (actual or potential) through Your use of the Service; acting inconsistently or in violation of any of Fiix’s policies; infringing someone else’s intellectual property rights; engaging in fraudulent, immoral or illegal activities; or for other reasons that could have an adverse effect on Fiix, its service providers or any other customers of the Service. Fiix may provide You with notice of termination by sending an email to the email address provided by You when registering for the Service. Fiix shall have the right, without any notice obligation, to terminate User accounts for the Free Service that have been inactive for more than thirty (30) days. Fiix shall also have the right to cancel any commercial User accounts that has been inactive for more than one (1) year.
10.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms or any Subscription Term for the Service, Your ability to access and use the Service (including Your Data) will end unless You renew Your subscription for the Service. Upon written request from You, Fiix will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with a copy of Your Data in CSV format, provided that Your access to the Service was not terminated pursuant to Section 10.3 and further provided that such request is made to Fiix within thirty (30) days of such termination or expiration. If You request a copy of Your Data, a minimum two (2) hour Professional Services fee will be applicable and You must pre-pay such fee before Fiix will begin the Professional Services to provide You with a CSV copy of Your Data.
10.5 Outstanding Fees. Termination of these Terms (and/or suspension of Your rights to access and/or use the Service) shall not relieve You of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or payable to Fiix prior to the effective date of any such termination or expiration. If these Terms and/or any Subscription Term(s) are terminated (or if Your rights to access and/or use the Service are suspended), You will not be entitled to a refund for the unused portion of any of Your Subscription Term(s).
