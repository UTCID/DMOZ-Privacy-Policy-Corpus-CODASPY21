Parliament Counts
Parliament Counts campaign
The RSS believes politicians and policymakers should have a basic understanding of statistics to ensure they make good decisions for the people they represent. That is why we offer statistics training sessions to the UK’s elected representatives and their staff to ensure they have a good grasp of the numbers so better decisions are made for the benefit of society.
General Election 2015
The Parliament Counts campaign was initially launched in 2015 to coincide with the Westminster General Election. We called on RSS members and supporters to get in touch with their electoral candidates, asking them to attend statistics training sessions run by the RSS, if elected. 324 candidates across the political spectrum signed up to the campaign, of which 55 were successfully elected on 7 May. We held three training sessions for MPs and their staff and we continue to support parliamentarians through our statistical literacy work.
Devolved Elections 2016
Following the elections of the National Assembly of Wales and the Scottish Parliament on 5th May 2016, the RSS offered statistics training workshops to Assembly Members and MSPs.
