FloTHERM Products
FloTHERM Products
Electronics cooling software from the leader in electronics thermal analysis
FloTHERM v11.0 Presentation
On-demand Web Seminar
The powerful FloTHERM® suite of 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software predicts airflow and heat transfer, in and around electronic equipment. FloTHERM delivers right-by-design products that save design time and reduce the need for physical prototyping from components and boards to complete systems and data centers.

“Thermal design bridges both the mechanical and electrical disciplines. Thermal management is mainly a mechanical issue, but heat is generated in silicon, so it is necessary to also understand electronics to do thermal design correctly.”
Takuya Shinoda, DENSO Corporation
“Our evaluation showed that FloTHERM and FloTHERM PCB thermal simulation software can save time in modeling while integrating the design process to a higher degree than other tools.”
Fabio Vitale, Galileo Avionica
“FloTHERM continues to allow us to design better and more innovative electronics cooling devices for smaller and hotter applications. Using FloTHERM versus a prototype build in this type of application saves approximately $5-10k worth of development costs.”
Matt Connors, Thermacore
