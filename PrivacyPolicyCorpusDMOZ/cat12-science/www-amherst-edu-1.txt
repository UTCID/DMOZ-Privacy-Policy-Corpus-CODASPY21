Privacy Statement
Please review the College’s Privacy Statement, which forms a part of these Terms. The Privacy Statement describes the collection, use, and protection of information about you on the Site.
Using the Site
The Site is intended to foster communication among the students, alumni, faculty, staff, friends, and others who together form the extended College community. It is a resource and forum for members of the community to exchange information of interest to them. To that end, various parts of the Site allow users to post messages, information, or other material, including text, images, photographs, video, sounds, musical works, computer files, computer programs, and works of authorship (collectively, "User Content"). User Content may appear, for example, on group activity pages, user-created pages, message boards, or other interactive forums.
The College is not responsible for User Content or any injury or offense it causes. The College has no obligation to (and generally does not) pre-screen, monitor, edit, or delete User Content, but the College reserves the right to do so if any User Content fails to comply with these Terms or is otherwise harmful, inaccurate or objectionable. The College is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing User Content that fails to comply with these Terms. The College does not endorse or adopt any User Content. The College does not endorse third-party web sites that may be listed in User Content.
The College values a diversity of viewpoints and expects users of the Site to exhibit the same level of respect for others on the Site as they would in any other College forum. All users of the Site are obligated to practice discretion and maintain civility in their online communications. While the College does not condone censorship, you may not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any User Content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or libelous, or that is threatening, hostile, harassing, or abusive on the basis of personal beliefs or characteristics. These include, but are not limited to, race, gender, sexual orientation, political affiliation or belief, age, color, religion, national origin, ethnic identification, physical or mental disability, economic status, or veteran status.

You may not use any material from the Site in a manner that attributes a false or misleading statement to, or implies a false endorsement by, the College or related parties.
You may have access through the Site to the Personal Data (as defined in the Privacy Statement) of others. This Personal Data is provided only for your personal use or for approved use in connection with College-related activities. You may not engage in or permit others to engage in data mining or the systematic collection of Personal Datafor any reason.
Without authorization, you may not reproduce, distribute, publicly display or perform, transmit, incorporate into a database or compilation, adapt, translate, modify or create derivative works of, or in any way exploit or use any material, User Content, or Personal Data on the Site (or any computer programs and other coding) that is protected by copyright or otherwise, whether owned by the College or a third party.
Certain areas of the Site are protected by user names and passwords and may be accessed only by members of the College community. If you have a user name and password, you agree not to share them with any other person, including any person who may have his or her own user name and password. You are responsible for all uses of your name and password to gain access to the Site and for all activity under them, including the use of any information or material obtained by using them. You may find further details in the Policy on Acceptable Use of the Amherst College Electronic Environment.
As a condition to your continued use of the Site, you warrant that you will not use the Site for any illegal or fraudulent purpose or for any purpose prohibited by these Terms. If the College believes, in its sole discretion, that your use of the Site violates these Terms or creates a liability for the college, the College reserves the right to take any and all actions it deems necessary. These include, but are not limited to, deleting content or information you have posted to the Site, terminating a discussion group or other collaborative page or activity, or limiting or denying your access to the Site.

Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
The College intends that all material posted on the Site respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties.

A notice of infringing material that complies with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) ("Notice") must be sent to the agent the College has designated with the Copyright Office:
John Manly (dmca[at]amherst.edu)
Director of Systems & Networking Rm B-15 Converse Hall Amherst College
Amherst, MA 01002-5000
(413) 542-2641
To comply with the Copyright Act, your Notice must be in writing and must include the following:
A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the College to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit the College to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
When the College receives a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, it will remove the identified material immediately. The College will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide the College with a counter-notice ("Counter-Notice) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include:
A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer;
Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error;
The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number; and
A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent.
Upon receipt of a Counter-Notice, the College will notify you of the Counter-Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days of receipt of the Counter-Notice, unless you inform the College that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.
