To remain internationally competitive, Australia’s mineral resources sector must achieve world-class productivity through enhanced collaboration, improved support for development and demonstration of more efficient technologies, and widespread adoption of productivity innovations including automation and big data analytics.
The mineral resources sector will continue to play a substantial role within the Australian economy.
Technology and process innovations will enable substantial capital, labour, resources and operational productivity improvements to ensure a sustainable and internationally competitive future for the sector.
Featured publication
Technology innovation for the mineral resources sector
Australian mineral resource exploration and development can only deliver positive economic and community benefits if it remains efficient and sustainable through ongoing investment in technological innovation.
