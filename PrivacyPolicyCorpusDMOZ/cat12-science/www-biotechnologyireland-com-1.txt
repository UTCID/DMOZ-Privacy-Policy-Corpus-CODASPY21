BioConnect IrelandOverviewBioConnect Ireland is an informal, open and independent networking organisation for individuals in the biotechnology, life science and medical device sectors in Ireland, North and South. It was founded in 2001 to promote interaction and exchange between all of those working in this broad field.   BioConnect Ireland meetings are where people make new contacts and reconnect with old friends and colleagues in this wide-ranging community. We run free open meetings several times per year on topics of general interest to the life science community. It is funded by contributions from annual sponsors – currently RFT Group and Enterprise Ireland.  We also encourage sponsors for single meetings on particular themes.  Upcoming BioConnect Ireland EventEvent Title:BioConnect Ireland - Harnessing the Power of GenomicsDate & Time:Wednesday 13th December, 2017 at 2.30pmAbout GenomicsGenomics is the study of genes and their interactions and functions. It has the potential to radically transform disease understanding, diagnosis and treatment. However, harnessing this potential raises a number of ethical, legal and social issues. This event will help inform clinicians, researchers (both in academic and industry) and the Irish Life Science community on the significant opportunities, potential pitfalls and international practices in this field.Agenda:Download Harnessing the Power of Genomics AgendaVenue:RCSI's Albert Theatre, 123 St. Stephens' Green, Dublin 2Registration:Register here BioConnect Meetings    The format of our afternoon meetings is two or more presentations on the core theme followed by a Q&A session. We also have a series of ‘Open Mike’ presentations which allow any relevant organisation 3 minutes to present needs, ideas, products or services. Each meeting ends with a networking session and refreshments to encourage interaction between participants.  In our recent survey the majority of the respondents report that they always or usually stay for this session, which many consider to be the highlight of the events, and only 18% never attend.Listing of BioConnect Ireland meeting themes to date Who attends?   Meetings attract from 70 to 150 people, depending on the theme. A 2015 survey of meeting attendees showed that 32% of attendees were from academic institutions; 21% from bio-industry; 30% were service-providers in consulting, legal or technical areas; and 11% from State agencies or civil service.  ContactFor further information, please contact:Jim Ryan  CIRCA Group Europe Ltd.
