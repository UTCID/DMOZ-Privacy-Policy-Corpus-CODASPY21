Terms of Use
First the Simple No Nonsense Version
At ezeebike
Canada, we pride ourselves on being good, ethical
people. We are trying to sell, and support, our products and to provide
some good information to the
electric bicycle community. We take great care in trying to appoint dealers who will respect and uphold our values.
Our web site(s) attempt to be accurate and up to date, but they are
maintained by humans
as such, they will almost always contain some
errors.
Products change as do prices and our website(s) may
sometimes be out of step with the latest product specifications and
pricing information.
We can assure you that we never
knowingly misrepresent anything
that is not our way. If you find
mistakes or errors and report them to us, we promise to promptly fix
them.
If you find a mistake in a price or a description,
do not try to sue us
thats just insane and the electric bike community
will hate you forever. Work with us to make this site the best source
of information that it can possibly be. That will be good for you and
good for us and part of our mission is to make positive changes.
One
last thing
dont steal content from our site without asking us. We
will usually allow it if you give us some sort of an acknowledgement.
Everything in this site is protected with copyrights and trademarks and
we can get more than a little snotty if you steal our stuff. For the electric bikes these is many lube substitutes
Thank you
