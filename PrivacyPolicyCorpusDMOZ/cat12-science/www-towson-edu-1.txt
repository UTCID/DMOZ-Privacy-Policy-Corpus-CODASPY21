HomePrivacy Statement
This privacy statement primarily addresses ways Towson University (“TU”) collects
and manages both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information
for users of its various websites and online portals.
TU complies with both federal and state law regarding privacy rights. For example,
as a state agency, TU does not create personal records unless the need for information
is clearly established. Such records must be relevant to the purposes for which they
are collected, be accurate and current, and not be obtained by fraudulent means.
Student Information
TU collects and retains relevant information, including “education records” as defined
under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R.
Part 99) (“FERPA”), for both prospective and enrolled students. Its purpose is to
further its mission, including providing successful academic opportunities throughout
a student’s academic journey. Students’ education records are protected and not disclosed
to third parties unless the student consents to the disclosure or a FERPA exception
applies. Learn more about TU’s compliance with FERPA.
Data Collection Forms
TU’s websites allow users to do things like request information, opt-in to receive
messages/updates, register for events, purchase goods, and complete various tasks.
To do so, TU uses electronic forms which collect necessary information, such as first
and last name, address, phone number, and email address. This information is provided
voluntarily and can be inspected and updated at a user’s request.
Cookies
TU uses various user-tracking technologies, including cookies, which allow it to collect
and analyze user data. Information collected in this way includes how often a user
visits a site, where users enter the site (e.g., by clicking on an advertisement or
link on another web page), and what actions users take while on TU’s websites. TU
utilizes this aggregate- and user-level site data to benchmark performance of websites
and inform marketing strategies. Individual web browsers provide instructions on rejecting or deleting cookies. Please
note some website pages and applications may not function properly if cookies are
rejected or deleted.
Advertising
TU uses display advertising on other websites and search engines which measure performance
and user behavior as it relates to those ads. Third parties, such as Google, Facebook,
and YouTube, show TU ads to various audiences. These third parties then provide data
to TU which helps it evaluate performance and assess user interactions before, during,
and after visiting a TU website. To do so, TU places tags or pixels on its websites
to capture information and inform interest-based advertising.
Security
Protecting personal information is our priority. TU takes appropriate and necessary
actions to safeguard user information and personal records. It employs reasonable
practices to help prevent the loss or misuse of data. Learn more about the university’s
data privacy practices.
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
Beginning May 25, 2018, the European Union (“EU”) will enforce data protection legislation
known as GDPR, which requires TU to protect the personal data of EU residents. Protected
personal data includes IP address, email address, and other device identifiers. TU
is committed to processing personal data in compliance with GDPR.
Privacy Updates
This statement has been updated as of May 25, 2018. Additional updates will be added
to this page. TU reserves the right to revise this statement at any time.
