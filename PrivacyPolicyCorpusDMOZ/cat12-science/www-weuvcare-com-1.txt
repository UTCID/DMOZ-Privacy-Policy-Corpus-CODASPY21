identifying a person and information concerning a person’s health, sex

absolutely necessary: we will ensure it is only seen by those who have
to see it; and will keep it secure. By law we are required to have a
policy document outlining how we protect such information and how long
the information is held for. Our policy document on this information
will be reviewed from time to time.

former employers, information from background check providers, and in
certain situations information from credit reference agencies.

period of your working relationship with us. This may be collected in
the course of your work-related activities. Whilst some of the personal
information you provide to us is mandatory and/or is a statutory or
contractual requirement, some of it you may be asked to provide to us on
a voluntary basis. We will inform you whether you are required to
provide certain personal information to us or if you have a choice in
this.

longer period.

certain conditions, and in certain circumstances, you have the right to:
request access to your personal information – this is usually known as making a data subject access request and it enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing itrequest rectification of your personal information – this enables you to have any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you correctedrequest the erasure of your personal information – this enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where there’s no compelling reason for its continued processing, e.g. it’s no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collectedrestrict the processing of your personal information – this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information, e.g. if you contest its accuracy and so want us to verify its accuracyobject to the processing of your personal information – this enables you to ask us to stop processing your personal information where we are relying on the legitimate interests of the business as our legal basis for processing and there is something relating to your particular situation which makes you decide to object to processing on this grounddata portability – this gives you the right to request the transfer of your personal information to another party so that you can reuse it across different services for your own purposes.
