Eurosystem balance sheet
This section contains links to information about the balance sheet of the Eurosystem as a whole, as well as disaggregated data
for the ECB and the euro area national central banks (NCBs).
The Eurosystem balance sheet comprises the assets and liabilities
of euro area NCBs and the ECB. It is published on a weekly
basis (consolidated financial statement) and on an annual basis (consolidated balance sheet).

The disaggregated data provide harmonised information about the decentralised implementation of the single monetary policy of the ECB, as well as about the non-monetary policy financial activities of the euro area NCBs.
The data are published on a monthly basis, both as contributions to the consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem (from June 2016), and as contributions to
the Eurosystem statistical balance sheet (from January 1999).
