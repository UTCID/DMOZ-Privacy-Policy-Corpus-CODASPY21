- Translations — If You create a translation of PISA content, please add the following disclaimer along with the attribution: This translation was not created by the OECD and should not be considered an official OECD translation.

OECD Legal Instruments .
Official texts of OECD Legal Instruments in both OECD official languages (English and French), as well as related information, are made available in the Compendium of OECD Legal Instruments at https://legalinstruments.oecd.org.  OECD Legal Instruments may be found elsewhere, including on OECD websites, but You should always consult the Compendium, as it is the only source of the official and up do date texts and information.
You may reproduce and distribute individual OECD Legal Instruments free of charge and without requesting any permissions, as long as You do not alter them in any way.  You may use excerpts of a Legal Instrument, as long as You ensure that the legal nature/integrity of the Instrument is preserved and the excerpt is not used out of context or provides incomplete information or otherwise mislead the reader as to the actual legal nature,  scope or content of the Legal Instrument. OECD Legal Instruments may not be sold but may be used in the context of commercial activities such as, for example, consulting or training services.
OECD Legal Instruments are available in the two OECD official languages (English and French). Translations into other languages may be available on the website, but the only official texts remain the English and French versions.
You may translate OECD Legal Instruments and related information and documents provided in the Compendium into other languages, as long as the translation is labelled “unofficial translation” and You include the following disclaimer: “This translation has been prepared by [translation author] for informational purpose only and its accuracy cannot be guaranteed by the OECD. The only official versions are the English and French texts available on the OECD website https://legalinstruments.oecd.org.
We encourage You to provide your translation (PDF format) to the OECD, e-mail legal@oecd.org
(c) Data
The OECD makes data (the “Data”) available for use and consultation by the public.  Data may be subject to restrictions beyond the scope of these Terms and Conditions, either because specific terms apply to those Data or because third parties may have ownership interests. It is the User’s responsibility to verify, either directly in the metadata or, if available, by clicking on the  icon and then referring to the "source" tab, whether the Data is fully or partially owned by third parties and/or whether additional restrictions may apply, and to contact the owner of the Data before incorporating it in your work in order to secure the necessary permissions. The OECD in no way represents or warrants that it owns or controls all rights in all Data, and the OECD will not be liable to any User for any claims brought against the User by third parties in connection with the use of any Data.
Permitted use
Except where additional restrictions apply as stated above, You can extract from, download, copy, adapt, print, distribute, share and embed Data for any purpose, even for commercial use. You must give appropriate credit to the OECD by using the citation associated with the relevant Data, or, if no specific citation is available, You must cite the source information using the following format: OECD (year), (dataset name),(data source) DOI or URL (accessed on (date)). When sharing or licensing work created using the Data, You agree to include the same acknowledgment requirement in any sub-licenses that You grant, along with the requirement that any further sub-licensees do the same.
Availability of Data
The availability of the Data is contingent upon the availability of the OECD’s corresponding resources, whose capacity is subject to change at any time. The OECD may monitor your use of the Data and reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without limitation, to modify the amount of Data You may request in a single query, to modify the number of queries You may make over a specified time, to remove certain Data and to alter the file formats in which Data are available.
OECD Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
You may use one or more OECD-developed application programming interfaces (“APIs”) to facilitate access to the Data. APIs are made available on an “as-is” basis, and use of an API is at your own risk. In particular, but without limitation, the OECD disclaims all warranties as to an API’s compatibility with your hardware and software and accepts no liability for any damages or claims arising out of or in connection with your use of an API and/or the underlying Data accessed through an API. For the avoidance of doubt, the OECD accepts no obligation to provide technical, administrative or other support in connection with the APIs or for any other purpose. The OECD may decide to suspend or terminate the provision of the APIs and API-accessible Data at any time.
The OECD may release updated versions of the APIs from time to time and at its sole discretion. Once the OECD releases updated versions, previous APIs may no longer function properly, and You therefore agree, for each API, to use the most up-to-date version available.
You agree not to modify, distribute, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or perform any similar action on the APIs or any of their portions or components.
The OECD reserves the right to limit or suspend any User’s IP address access to the APIs at any time and without notice for any reason, including if the OECD determines that You are using or are attempting to use the Data and/or the APIs in violation of these Terms and Conditions in such a way as to harm the OECD or any other party, or if You are placing too great a strain on the infrastructure necessary for making the Data available to a reasonable number of people. You agree not to use any technical means to interfere with the OECD’s monitoring of usage of the above-mentioned resources. The OECD reserves the right to use any technical means to overcome attempted technical interference with usage monitoring. Finally, the Data and the APIs will be unavailable from time to time, at the OECD’s sole discretion, for periodic maintenance.
When entering an API query, the OECD encourages, but does not require, You to register your details so that we can keep You informed of technical updates to the APIs. The information You provide to the OECD during the voluntary registration process will be handled in accordance with the OECD Privacy Policy.  Registration in no way impacts the application of these Terms and Conditions on You or the OECD.
As noted above, these Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to time. By using an API, You agree to periodically review these Terms and Conditions, to take note of any changes thereto, and to adapt your usage of the API accordingly.
II. Communication and Messaging Facilities
You shall not do any of the following in any messaging or communication facilities that may be found on an OECD Website:
defame, abuse, harass, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights of others;
publish, post, distribute or disseminate any defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful material;
upload or attach files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws unless You own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary permissions;
upload or attach files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer;
upload, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available unsolicited advertising of any goods or services, or conduct or forward surveys, contests, "spam" or chain letters; etc.
The OECD reserves the right to deny, at its sole discretion, any User’s IP address online access to the OECD Websites or any portion thereof without notice.
You specifically acknowledge and agree that the OECD is not liable for any conduct of any other User, including, but not limited to, the types of conduct listed above.
III. Linking to the OECD Websites
In order to promote its work, and because linking is an essential aspect of the Internet, the OECD encourages You to include hyperlinks to the OECD Websites without having to ask prior permission, under the following conditions:
These hyperlinks must not:
infringe the OECD's rights, in particular relating to its name, logo, acronym and intellectual property rights;
be used for the promotion of an organisation or company, or of any commercial products or services.
Consequently,
if You link to an OECD Website, You must refrain from creating frames, or using other visual altering tools, around the OECD Website;
once a link to an OECD Website has been created, it should be tested to ensure that it works and meets the above conditions. We would then appreciate being notified via webmaster@oecd.org.
If You have further questions about linking to the OECD Websites, e-mail webmaster@oecd.org.
IV. OECD Name, Acronym and Logo
Linking and referring to the OECD
The OECD encourages You to use its logo when linking or referring to the OECD. To receive graphic files and a user’s guide, send your request to logo@oecd.org.
All reproductions of the OECD logo must respect the current rules for use and the OECD’s corporate identity. Only the most recent version of the OECD logo should be used.
OECD logo for authorship and endorsement
As stated in Section I above, You may not claim any affiliation with the OECD. If You wish to use the OECD name, acronym, logo or other identifying symbol in a way that implies endorsement, partnership or authorship, You must obtain our written permission and agreement on how the name, acronym, logo or other identifying symbol will be used. Send your request to logo@oecd.org. If permission is granted, it is only granted for the specific usage referred to in OECD’s reply; each new use requires a new request.
V. Disclaimers
THE MATERIAL AS WELL AS ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE OECD ON THE OECD WEBSITES OR ON ANOTHER MEDIUM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. The OECD makes every effort to ensure, but does not guarantee, the accuracy or completeness of the Material (including the Data). If errors are brought to our attention, we will try to correct them.
The OECD may add, change, improve, or update the Material without notice. The OECD reserves its exclusive right in its sole discretion to alter, limit or discontinue all or part of the OECD Websites and/or any Material. Under no circumstances shall the OECD be liable for any loss, damage, liability or expense suffered which is claimed to result from use of the OECD Websites or the Material, including without limitation, any fault, error, omission, interruption or delay. In particular, and without limitation, the OECD disclaims all guarantees as to the compatibility of the OECD Websites with any hardware, operating system, web browser, or other means of accessing the OECD Websites. Use of the Material or any OECD Website or any component thereof (including the Data and APIs) is at the User's sole risk.
We make every effort to minimise disruption caused by technical errors. However, some Material on the OECD Websites may have been created or structured in files or formats which are not error-free and it cannot be guaranteed that the OECD Websites will not be interrupted or otherwise affected by such problems. The OECD accepts no responsibility with regard to such problems (failure of performance, computer virus, communication line failure, alteration of content, etc.) incurred as a result of using the OECD Websites or any link to external sites.
For site security purposes, and to ensure that the OECD Websites remain available to all Users, the OECD employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorised attempts to upload or make changes to the OECD Websites or any Material, or otherwise cause damage and to detect other possible security breaches.
The OECD Websites may contain advice, opinions and statements from external websites. Hyperlinks to non-OECD Internet sites do not imply any official endorsement of or responsibility for the opinions, ideas, data or products presented at these locations or guarantee the validity of the information provided. The sole purpose of links to other sites is to indicate further information available on related topics.
The mention of specific companies or certain products does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by the OECD in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned.
Territorial disclaimers
Information contained in the Material and on the OECD Websites does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the OECD Secretariat or its Members concerning the legal status of any country or of its authorities. Its content, as well as any data and any maps displayed are without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory, to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory, city or area.
The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.
Note by Turkey The information in the documents with reference to “Cyprus” relates to the southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of the United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”.
Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in the documents relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
VI. Preservation of immunities
