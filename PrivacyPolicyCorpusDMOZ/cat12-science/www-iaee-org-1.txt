The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan was established in June 1966 and certified as an incorporated foundation by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in September that year. The aim of its establishment is to carry on research activities specialized in the area of energy from the viewpoint of the national economy as a whole in a bid to contribute to sound development of the Japanese energy-supplying and energy-consuming industries and to the improvement of people's life in the country by objectively analyzing energy problems and providing basic data, information and reports necessary for the formulation of policies. With the diversification of social needs during the three and a half decades of its operation, IEEJ has expanded its scope of research activities to include such topics as environmental problems and international cooperation closely related to energy. In October 1984, the Energy Data and Modeling Center (EDMC) was established as an IEEJ-affiliated organization to carry out such tasks as the development of energy data bases, building of various energy models and econometric analyses of energy. In July 1999, EDMC was merged into IEEJ and began operating as an IEEJ division under the same name, i.e., the Energy Data and Modeling Center.
The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) was founded in 1968 and currently under the administration of Atomic Energy Council (AEC), Taiwan, ROC. INER is the sole national research institute to promote peaceful applications of nuclear science in Taiwan. To comply with the energy policy of the government, INER has initiated an integrated energy research program using our nuclear technologies, consisting of several projects, to develop new/renewable and eco-friendly energy technologies with lower cost and high efficiency. As a national research institute, INER possesses a strong research team composed of nearly 500 talented researchers with graduate degrees. In the future, INER is determined to actively meet the severe domestic challenges in energy and environmental areas. Through the use of research results, INER aims to bring welfare to the people as well as feedback to the society and the country.

The Baker Institute Center for Energy Studies (CES) provides new insights on the role of economics, policy and regulation in the performance and evolution of energy markets. Independently and through collaborations with other Baker Institute programs, Rice University faculty, and scholars from around the world, the CES consistently produces data-driven analysis to support a deeper understanding of local and international political and economic issues impacting energy markets. Programs at the CES center on economic modeling and forecasting, the nexus between energy and environment, and emerging technologies, regulations and geopolitical risk. Thus, the CES provides policymakers, corporate leaders, and the public with a non-partisan, high quality, data-driven, analytical voice on energy and environmental issues that often can be politically divisive.
Aramco Services Company (ASC) operates as a vital link between Saudi Aramco, the worldâs leading energy company and North America.

The Technische Universitaet Berlin (TU Berlin) with its seven faculties and 320 senior and 15 junior professors strives to promote the accumulation of knowledge and to facilitate technological progress by adhering to the fundamental principles of excellence and quality. Regional, national and international networking with partners in science and industry is an important aspect in all these endeavors. The university focuses on six core research priorities defined by related competencies and social obligations. One of these is Energy Systems and Sustainable Resource Management. This research priority includes energy technology, energy economics and politics, climate change, water supply, and the management of limited resources in general. Areas of research presently focus on efficient gas turbines, photovoltaic systems, networks and functional energy storage, energy-efficient cities, and water supplies. Scientific innovations and their impacts on production and consumption patterns play pivotal roles in this process, as do local environmental factors. In close cooperation with other research fields such as "Materials, Design and Manufacturing" and "Infrastructure and Mobility", research is devoted towards sustaining future living standards and ensured energy supplies for society at large. The professors chairing "Energy Systems" and "Infrastructure Policy" have, among others, for many years served IAEE in different functions.
