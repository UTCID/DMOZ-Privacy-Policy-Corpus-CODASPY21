Collecting your personal details IHE Delft collects personal details (if this is necessary) in order to provide services, to conduct transactions, to register students in its programmes, to distribute information or to grant access.

This includes measuring surfing behaviour using web statistics and other systems that are integrated into the website to collect active feedback from users or to conduct research with various versions of websites.
Contact by e-mail We roughly distinguish two types of automated email: transactional email that you have initiated/requested yourself, and recruiting email. Transactional email is an essential part of a service that you have chosen, such as resetting a password or confirming an application or a request for information. You therefore cannot unsubscribe for this type of email.
If you have consented to receiving recruiting emails such as newsletters or invitations to events, you may withdraw your consent. This type of email has opt-out options. Due to the decentralized nature of email communication, there is no institute-wide opt-out option.
Just as for the websites, IHE Delft uses analysis tools to analyse the reading and clicking behaviour for newsletters in order to analyse and improve our newsletters. We do not however link this information to your personal details.
