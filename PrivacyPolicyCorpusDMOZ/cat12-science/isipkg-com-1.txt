This information may be maintained in locations within the United States, accessible to our global recruiting team, and be shared with our corporate affiliates for the purpose of evaluating you for positions within our company.  The information submitted by job seekers, such as name, contact details and any other information relevant to the application is used to evaluate their qualifications for employment and to contact them regarding possible employment opportunities. It is in our legitimate business interests to use this information in the selection process and to communicate with you, and it will be necessary to provide us with this information so that we can assess your application.
Job seekers may also choose to provide sensitive personal information such as gender or ethnic background.  Providing this data is optional and is not required to apply for a job with Koch Industries.  This information will not be considered in evaluating candidates’ qualifications for employment.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT BY AUTOMATED MEANS
When you visit and interact with our websites and applications, we may collect “Other Information” that does not inherently reveal your specific identity, in order to learn how to best tailor our websites for our visitors.  Examples of what Other Information we may collect and how we and third-party service providers may collect this information include:
Aggregation Information – Aggregated user information does not personally identify you or any other user (for example, we may aggregate user information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).  Aggregated data is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
App Usage Data – When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
Browser and Device Information – Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your computer type, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the online services (such as the Apps) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the online services function properly.
Cookies –  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer or mobile device that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the online services, pages visited, referring URL, and other aggregated website traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to collect statistical information, and to personalize your experience while online.
Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the online services or to send you advertisements and marketing emails.  We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and marketing emails.  You can opt out of such interest-based advertising using cookies set by participating NAI members at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/.  Opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertising online. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opt out will no longer show ads that have been tailored to your interests.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser or, depending on your jurisdiction, by managing your tracking preferences as noted in a separately posted cookie statement or via a posted cookie manager.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the online services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.  At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals except in jurisdictions where we are required to do so by law.
IP Address – Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the online services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering our online services.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address to understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come.
Physical Location and Mobile Location-Based Services – We may collect the physical location of your device if you have consented to us doing so, by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, Wi-Fi signals, or other technologies.  We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.
If you have downloaded one of our Apps, you may enroll to receive offers by agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information about your location through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or similar capabilities.  We will collect this information if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or later) to receive the offers and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device.
Pixel Tags or Similar Technologies – Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some online services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the online services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the online services and response rates.  We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our services and report on activities and trends.  These services may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/,and opt-out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Business Transfers – We may disclose your personal information, usage information, and other information about you to parties acquiring part or all of our assets, as well as to attorneys and consultants. If we transfer your information to an acquirer, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the acquirer to use your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, your information may be considered a company asset that may be sold or transferred to third parties.
Corporate Affiliates – We may share the information you provide (such as information about your orders, enquiries, applications or use of our websites) within Koch Industries and with Koch affiliates for marketing, recruitment and internal reporting purposes.  We do this to run our business more efficiently and to have a better understanding of our customers across business lines.
Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulators, Government Authorities or other Third Parties – We may transfer and disclose your information to third parties (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, (iii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, (iv) to verify or enforce our policies, Terms of Use and other agreements or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Koch Industries, our customers, or others (v) to respond to an emergency, (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity or (vii) otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, users of our services or the public.
Marketing Partners – In some cases, we may permit certain network advertising companies and publishers to collect personal information on our sites.  In addition, our business partners may access personal information about you that we have combined with such business partners’ data.

If you agree to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third-party subject to the privacy notice and business practices of that third party.
Third-Party Service Providers – In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the services, to respond to your inquiries, and for other purposes described in the “How We Use Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy, we may share your personal information or usage information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our sites; analyze data; provide customer service; mail product samples or manage payments; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions, e-commerce activities, provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list), or assist with risk management, compliance, legal and audit functions. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU
We may make automated decisions about you using your personal information in the following circumstances:
Automated processing may be used when evaluating large numbers of applicants for job vacancies. For these purposes we would request that you create a profile and answer some job-related questions to evaluate your skills as compared to the published job requirements.  An algorithm may then be used to determine which candidates will be allowed to proceed to the next step within the selection process. We consider this data and process to be relevant because it will assist us to select the applicant most suitable for our vacancies.  The outcome of the evaluation may have an impact on whether you are offered a role for the vacancy you apply to.
You can contact us via the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy to request further information about automated decision-making, object to our use of automated decision-making, or request an automated decision to be reviewed by us if required by local law.
