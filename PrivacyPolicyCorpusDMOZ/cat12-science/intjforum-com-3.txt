Log Files
As is typical of sites on the Internet, INTJ Forum collects and applies to its own functioning user data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes but is not necessarily limited to the user's IP (internet protocol) address, ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Comcast), the browser used to visit INTJ Forum (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time at which INTJ Forum was visited, the pages visited throughout INTJ Forum, and the contents of all posts, comments, and messages transmitted by users to INTJ Forum. Please see the INTJ Forum Terms of Use for more information.
Cookies and Web Beacons
INTJ Forum uses Invision Power Service cookies to store information for the functioning of the Invision Power Service software running at INTJ Forum, including but not necessarily limited to Forum settings toggled by the user (if any) and the ability to login to INTJ Forum. Users can disable the Invision Power Service cookies set by INTJ Forum via their own browser settings, or by managing preferences in local programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this is likely to alter the user's ability to interact with INTJ Forum. For example, it is not possible to login to INTJ Forum without enabling the Invision Power Service software running at INTJ Forum to set cookies.
In addition, third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to INTJ Forum.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visits to INTJ Forum and/or other sites on the Internet.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting Google's advertising opt-out page. Alternatively, users may opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Users can opt out of some (but not all) of these cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
