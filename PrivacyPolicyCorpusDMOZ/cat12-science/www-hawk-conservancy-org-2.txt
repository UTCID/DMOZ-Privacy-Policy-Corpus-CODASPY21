Please note that a valid Blue Peter Badge Holder will be admitted free of charge with each full paying adult and must present their ID card on arrival.

Large groups are advised to contact the main office (01264 773850) in advance of their visit.
By using this site to buy tickets, you agree that they are for the personal use of you and your party only, and you will not attempt to resell them in any way.
We reserve the right to cancel ticket bookings which we reasonably suspect to have been made fraudulently.
The right to admission is reserved by the Hawk Conservancy Trust, who may take health and safety, environmental and security concerns into account, and may carry out security searches. We are unable to offer you a refund if you are refused entry to or ejected on account of declining to be searched, abusive, threatening, drunken, or other antisocial behaviour (including smoking in no smoking areas), carrying offensive weapons or illegal substances, or making unauthorised audio, video or photographic recordings.

Vouchers and tickets are non-refundable and no change will be given. Once a specific date is booked, they are non-transferable.
The Trust reserves the right to vary the content and format of any event, experience, course or workshop, without notice, if necessary.
For events, experiences, courses or workshops that include refreshments, we are able to cater for special dietary requirements; however, these must be pre-booked. Please let us know, at least 14 days in advance, of any special requirements for example vegetarian, gluten-free, diabetic or any other food intolerances.  Please telephone 01264 773850 or email: info@hawkconservancy.org.
Experiences, courses, workshops and events will take place during all weathers, unless it is deemed unsafe to proceed by the Hawk Conservancy Trust. If an experience, course, workshop or event is cancelled by the Hawk Conservancy Trust due to safety issues, you will be offered an alternative date; if there is no alternative date, the value of your ticket can be exchanged for a different activity provided by the Trust. We will endeavour to contact all the guests on any activity that we cancel. However, for larger events as well as our general admissions, a message may be posted on the Trust’s Facebook page and/or the Trust’s website, and we advise monitoring these prior to attending any activity.

The judge’s decision will be final and no correspondence will be entered into.
The prizes exclude:
Any form of insurance.
Any accommodation.

Any personal expenses and spending money
Any additional events or experiences at the Trust

Photographic Competition
You must be the sole author and owner of the copyright for all images entered.
By entering your images into the competition, you give the Hawk Conservancy Trust a non-exclusive licence to reproduce the images for any purpose including, but not limited to, the following purposes: judging the competition, display of winning entries held at the Trust, inclusion into the BIAZA photographic competition, inclusion within Trust marketing and promotional material and for use in Trust merchandise. The Trust reserves the right to display, reproduce and publish in any media any entry, without payment, for the sole purpose of the Trust and its promotion and publicity. Should the Trust use any image for promotional or other purposes every effort will be made to give credit to the photographer (where possible).
There will be no cash alternative to the announced prizes; the judges’ decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into by the judges. Winners will be announced in the spring of the year following the competition.
Images should not include copyright details on them. If and when your images are used by the Trust, we will make our best efforts to include this information alongside your image.
In order to submit your photos to the competition, you must seek permission from anyone featured in photos entered unless they are a Hawk Conservancy Trust member of staff who is at work at the time the photo was taken. The Hawk Conservancy Trust accepts no responsibility for publishing images of people who have not given their permission to be included within a published and shared image.
All entries must be taken during the year of the competition, and must feature only birds of prey taken at the Hawk Conservancy Trust (or at other locations where Trust birds are displayed by Trust staff), wild birds of prey taken in their natural setting, or animals, insects, wildlife, plants and/or fungi found at the Trust’s visitor centre, or the sculptures featured there.
Images that show birds of prey eating or catching prey and that, in the opinion of the Trust or its representatives, could cause offence will be removed from the competition. No correspondence will be entered into.
An entry of no more than 12 images per photographer may be submitted during each month from the commencement of the competition until its closing date. Images submitted for the competition during a calendar month should be sent together in a single batch, covered by a single entry form.
Images should be at a size of at least 2000 pixels on the longest edge.
Any image that, in the opinion of the Trust or its representatives, is deemed inappropriate will be removed from the competition. No correspondence will be entered into.
The competition is open to amateur and professional photographers.
In order to enter the competition the entrant must pay a one off fee of £7.50. This allows the entrant to enter up to 12 images per month. If an entrant wishes to enter more than this, they will need to pay for an additional entry fee.
The photographic competition is not open to members of the Hawk Conservancy Trust staff and their immediate family.
Images which could be eligible for more than one category can only be entered once and in one category only.
The Hawk Conservancy Trust reserves the right to withdraw any images that could be deemed offensive or inappropriate.
Membership and Supporters
Current membership and supporter types are available for a limited time only.
Membership is only valid for the person(s) named on the membership card. It is non-transferable and any misuse will result in membership cancellation with immediate effect without compensation.
The minimum term for all membership and support options is 12 months from the date purchased.
Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult.
Membership does not allow voting rights.
The Hawk Conservancy Trust reserves the right to withdraw or vary any of the aspects of the membership scheme at any time.
The Hawk Conservancy Trust reserves the right to ask Members to leave the Trust at any time.
Membership does not grant free admission to events.
Photography and filming
The Hawk Conservancy Trust location, logo and livestock are the property of the Trust and, as such, if used in photos remain the property of the Hawk Conservancy Trust.
