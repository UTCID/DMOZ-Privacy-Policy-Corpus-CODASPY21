Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions
Maine Maritime Privacy Policy
1. PRIVACY POLICY
Maine Maritime Academy is a supplier of information about our higher education. We are committed to using the Internet and its derivatives to make this process easier. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy. Our privacy charter has three promises to you:
We will not release personally identifiable information about you without your permission (except as needed to provide to you the services you have expressly requested). See “9. Third party relationships” below.
You can manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us.
You can tell us what your privacy questions and concerns are so that we can respond.
From time to time new tools and enhancements will be introduced onto the site. Please visit this page from time to time to find out what’s new in relation to these enhancements.
2. HELPFUL DEFINITIONS
Personally identifiable information is information, such as name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address that can be used to identify the individual.
Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as sites you visit and searches you do). Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or IP addresses (see “8. Use of IP addresses” below) of Internet browsers that visit our site, the time of day the site was visited, and other non-personal information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any person, but helps us know what our users do (for example, the average stay on our site lasts over 5 minutes).
The next sections tell how and when we collect anonymous information and personally identifiable information from you.
3. COLLECTING AND USING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
You can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself to us. It is only when you register for certain services with Maine Maritime Academy that you will be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information.
Most of our services do not require any form of customer registration, but we do require registration for some services. For example, we ask for information so we can contact you (like your name, email address, and mobile phone number). We use this information in several ways:
to tell you about new features and services available on our campus that are relevant to you
to provide a first and last name on messages you receive from us
to record your visit to certain pages, in order for us to improve the content we provide
4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR IDENTITY
From time to time we receive requests to disclose the identities of our users. We do not disclose the identities of our users unless we are legally required to do so.
5. ANONYMOUS INFORMATION
We collect anonymous information when people use our site, even if they have not registered with us. We use this information to produce more relevant content, and to improve our services in general.
We will not share any anonymous information about your use of our site with third parties if we know that this information will be linked with your personally identifiable information obtained from another source, unless you have given us permission to do this.
6. COOKIES
A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. We may use cookies to help us provide personal services and to allow you to sign-in to our site without having to enter your username and password each time. Cookies also make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re on our site. Cookies may also be used by other companies on co-branded Web pages, as explained below in “9. Third party relationships”.
You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your computer. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you do not accept cookies, then some of our features may not work as we intended them to work.
7. SPECIAL TYPES OF INFORMATION
We will not share with third parties any personally identifiable information about you unless you have given us your permission.
8. USE OF IP ADDRESSES
An Internet protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your Internet service provider or through your company’s local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers, the computers that provide web pages for viewing, automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online.
We may collect IP addresses for some purposes (for example, to report anonymous user information and to audit the use of our site). We do not link a user’s IP address to a person’s personal information, which means we will have a record of each user’s session but the user remains anonymous to us.
PLEASE NOTE: Under certain circumstances, IP addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when this information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries such as Network Solutions or ARIN.
9. THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS
We will only pass on your personal information to named third parties if you expressly permit it and we will always give you the option to decline this.
No third-party sites are covered by our Privacy Policy, but we will make every effort to ensure that third party sites comply with our Privacy Policy.
10. COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS (GDPR)
Compliance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) applies to European Economic Area (EEA) visitors/users. In order to complete a requested action for a visitor/user, we may collect and use personal information with your consent. Under certain circumstances, you have the rights under data protection laws in relation to our personal data.
You have the right to:
Request access to your personally identifiable information (personal data)
Request correction of the personal data we have collected
Request erasure of your personal data
Reject processing of your personal data through a third party
Request a limitation on processing of your personal data
Request a transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party
Withdraw or change consent at any time
If you wish to act on any of the rights listed here, please contact us at gdpr@mma.edu.
11. SECURITY
We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.
Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
