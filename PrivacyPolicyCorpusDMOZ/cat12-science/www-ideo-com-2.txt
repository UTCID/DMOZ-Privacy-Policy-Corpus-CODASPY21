Survey questions may include questions asking for your personal information (such as your age or gender) or preferences (such as whether you like cats or dogs). The amount of compensation you receive varies based on the amount of questions in the survey you have filled out. Additional incentives may be offered for surveys targeted at harder to source respondent audiences. The more questions you are asked to, and do fill out, the more compensation you will receive. Most Shape feedback respondents are sourced from targeted Facebook ads. For example, we may use Facebook to target rock climbers. However, in some cases, you may directly provide SHAPE with additional information about you and we may reach out to you to complete surveys based on that information. For example, you may choose to build your profile on SHAPE by telling us you are female, aged 25-35 and you love dogs and cats. If you provide that additional personal information to SHAPE this may increase the likelihood that we will reach out to you to complete further surveys and thus the amount of compensation you will receive. For example, if you have told us you are female and love dogs and cats, you may receive a survey targeting female pet owners and will receive compensation if you choose to fill out that Survey. Survey topics and desired feedback survey respondents on SHAPE are determined by SHAPE clients and not IDEO. As a result, IDEO cannot guarantee that providing any kind of information to IDEO will result in increased compensation to respondents.Contact UsIf you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies or practices, please contact us at privacynotice@ideo.com.6.

Users are invited to the tool using a unique meeting link sent by the moderator and will be assigned a unique session ID (no account registration required) which will be deleted when the group session ends. Alternatively, a temporary account can be created.DCT uses Google Analytics and as stated above in this privacy policy, we recommend you review their privacy terms. The digital technology developed by IDEO in partnership with the Sundance Institute, is used alongside remote conferencing software. IDEO uses zoom as its chosen provider. Zoom’s privacy policy can be found here. It is possible if you are part of an organization that your organization has requested a different software provider to facilitate the session remotely. If this is the case, we suggest you review the privacy terms before accepting any invite or downloading related software.During use of the DCT, users will have an option to identify themselves by uploading a personal image, which represents them during the session, and by inputting the name by which they would like to be referred. The user determines which personal image and whether to choose an avatar or other image to represent their participation. Other users will do the same, and we ask you to respect the privacy of other users and do not capture their image, participation in the CT app, or any other personal data you may be privy to during the session, unless you have permission to do so.
