We process your personal data for the following purposes:
To ensure you receive the service, product or information you have requested or bought from us

If we plan to introduce further processes for the use of your information, we will provide information about that purpose prior to such processing.
The legal basis for processing
Under Data Protection Law, there are various grounds which are considered to be a ‘legal basis for processing’.
The legal basis for processing should be determined by the Data Controller.
Where we are the Data Processor, the legal basis is determined by the Customer. Typically, the legal basis in this scenario is:
‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’
Where we are the Data Controller, the legal basis for processing is based on:
‘processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller’
It should be noted that in some circumstances this legal basis may vary, however, we always operate in full compliance with Data Protection Law and will only process data with a fair and reasonable legal basis for doing so.

Sharing personal information with third parties
We use a range of trusted service providers to help deliver our services. All of our suppliers are subject to appropriate safeguards, operating in accordance with our specific instructions and limitations, and in full compliance with Data Protection Law.
These service providers include:
Payment Processors – to securely process your card payments (we do not see, or store payment card details)
Email Providers – to send out our email notifications or messages to ALL members, current and lapsed
Hosting Providers – to manage our secure enterprise data centres
Security Providers – to protect our systems from attack
Telephony Providers – we might record calls for training, quality and security purposes
Mailing houses – we provide postal and member data to enable the mailing of printed materials (e.g. Languages Today)
We may also have access to your personal information as part of delivering the service. If we need to change or add additional third parties, we will always update our Privacy Notice accordingly. We will only disclose your information to other parties in the following limited circumstances
where we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. to law enforcement and regulatory authorities
where there is a duty to disclose in the public interest
where disclosure is necessary to protect our interest e.g. to prevent or detect crime and fraud
where you give us permission to do so e.g. by providing consent within our website or via an online application or consent form
How long will we keep your personal information
We will only retain information for as long as is necessary to deliver the service safely and securely. We may need to retain some records to maintain compliance with other applicable legislation – for example finance, taxation, fraud and money laundering law requires certain records to be retained for an extended duration, in some cases for up to seven years.
