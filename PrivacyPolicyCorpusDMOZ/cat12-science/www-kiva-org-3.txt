How do I get a loan?
Kiva is not a bank or microfinance institution, which means that most of the loans fundraising on our website were not provided by Kiva directly. Because we know that finding the right loan can be a challenging process here are a few options to consider:If you’re an entrepreneur in the U.S. --Kiva supports entrepreneurs in the U.S. with interest-free loans which are crowdfunded by lenders across the globe and are paid back over the course of a couple of months to a few years. Kiva U.S. loans can be as large as $10,000.Rather than assessing credit history and financial statements, Kiva U.S. relies on trust networks as a measure of creditworthiness. For that reason, applicants are required to secure initial lenders from within their own network prior to fundraising on Kiva (and sometimes a Trustee as well). To learn more and apply for a loan please visit: kiva.org/borrowQuestions about applying for a U.S. loan can be sent here: borrowers@kiva.orgIf you live in another country around the world --Kiva partners with Field Partners in many countries around the world who may be able to make a loan to you. These loans vary in interest rates, loan amounts and requirements. To apply for a loan through a Field Partner, please contact them directly. A list of Kiva's Field Partners and their contact information can be found at: kiva.org/about/where-kiva-worksIf you can’t find a partner near you please try the MIX Market, which is a great website that collects data on microfinance institutions around the world. Please refer to their website: mixmarket.orgPlease note, MIX Market is an information service and doesn’t provide funding. Also note that Kiva does not have a say in which businesses are selected by our Field Partners. Contact each partner directly for more information on loan requirements and underwriting guidelines.

Donations to Kiva's operating expenses are always optional, although vital to what we do. 100% of every dollar lent on Kiva goes toward funding loans and we never take a cut -- instead, we support our operations through donations from our lender community. While a donation is automatically suggested during checkout, you can always opt out on the Basket page by clicking the pencil icon next to the donation amount and then the "No donation to Kiva" link.

Repayments
Can I forgive a loan or request that a borrower not have to repay?
While offers to forgive loans are very generous, Kiva's lending process is designed to accommodate loans and not donations. This means that all funding requests posted to Kiva are considered loans, and there unfortunately isn't a way to request that a borrower not repay your portion of the loan they received. Our hope is that once you've been repaid you'll recycle your credit to make even more loans on Kiva -- helping reach even more borrowers around the world.

Lending basics
What's the difference between a Kiva loan and a donation?
Lending and donating on Kiva are distinct actions which are easy to confuse. To clarify, loans are made to borrowers, while donations are made to our operating expenses. When you lend to a borrower, your loans are not tax-deductible. Our hope is that all Kiva loans will be repaid so you can use your funds to lend again. When you make a donation to Kiva, you're helping cover the costs of running the website and allowing our nonprofit to continue providing loans around the world. Donations, unlike loans, are one-time gifts that don't return to you, but are eligible for a tax-deduction in the U.S. Please note that when you lend you're also given the opportunity to make a donation to Kiva in addition to your loan. You can also donate to Kiva at any time here:

Lending amounts
Can I lend less than $25?
Kiva divides loans into $25 amounts and the minimum amount that you can contribute to a loan is $25. However, you can still make a loan if you have less than $25 of Kiva credit in your account. When you select a loan to support and proceed through the checkout process, we'll automatically deduct the Kiva credit in your account from the amount of your purchase. You can then pay for the remainder of your loan with funds from a credit card or PayPal account.  That said, Kiva is still weighing the value of alternative loan amounts, and feedback like yours is helpful for our team to consider while evaluating a change like this.

When their loan is repaid, they can use those funds again and again to make even more loans on Kiva.

Delinquency & default
What does it mean that my loan is delinquent?
Loans can become delinquent if either the borrower or Field Partner falls behind on making repayments according to the repayment schedule that was set when the loan was posted to Kiva. If you click on the "Repayment Schedule" link on a loan profile and then "Show advanced", you'll be able to see further explanation for why the loan is delinquent. If a loan is marked as delinquent, this means that Kiva still expects repayments to be made on the loan. In the case of a borrower's delinquency, you can assume that the Field Partner is working with the borrower to reschedule the loan term, if necessary, to try to recover eventual repayment of the loan. If the delinquency is due to a Field Partner being late in repaying Kiva lenders, you can assume that a member of the Kiva team is following up with the partner to work on recovering the amount owed to lenders. If Kiva or the Field Partner determines the collection of funds is doubtful, the loan will be marked as defaulted and you'll be notified by email. Until then, we will continue making efforts to recover lender funds.

However, if you are logged into your existing Kiva account and have applied the code from your Kiva Card at kiva.org/redeem, the funds will be applied after you choose a loan and reach the Basket page during checkout.Please note that if you do not apply the total amount of your Kiva Card toward loans at the time you redeem it, the remaining amount on your Kiva Card will be reflected in your total Kiva credit. However, in order to redeem it, you will need to make at least one $25 loan. Any remaining funds deposited in your Kiva account also can’t be withdrawn without first being lent to a borrower.

Attributing loans to a team
How do I attribute loans to my lending team?
To attribute a loan to a team, you will see a drop-down box on the "Basket" page next to "Team." Use this drop-down box to select the correct team. If you'd like loans to be attributed to your team automatically, you can set a preferred team on the My Teams page at: kiva.org/teams/my-teams
Under the headline "Lending Teams I Belong To" you'll see
a pulldown box where you can set your preferred team next to the team of your choice. You can also count loans toward a lending team for up to 14 days after the loan is made. To do so, just go to kiva.org/portfolio/loans and use the drop-down next to the loan to select a team to attribute it to. After 14 days there is unfortunately no way to attribute that loan to your team.

Availability of loans
Why are there no loans matching my area of interest?
At Kiva we rely on our Field Partners to upload loans to the website. Sometimes the demand for specific loans outpaces our partners' ability to upload these loans. Additionally, many partners are currently unable to post loans due to restrictions in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This may be the reason you are not seeing the specific type of loans that you're looking for. To respond to the COVID-19 crisis, we have created a loan category for borrowers whose businesses have been impacted by the pandemic. You can find these loans here: https://www.kiva.org/lend-by-category/covid-19In that category, you’ll see loans to Field Partners whose operations are impacted by the pandemic. These Crisis Support Loans are a great way to extend support to the organizations who normally administer loans to borrowers to help them continue to provide loans during and after the crisis.If you wish to support borrowers impacted by COVID-19 as they become available, you can also make a one-time or reoccurring contribution to the COVID-19 Response Fund here: https://www.kiva.org/covid19responsePlease note, when you contribute to the COVID-19 Response Fund, at this time there is not a way to further specify loan characteristics (such as location or business type) within this category.If you prefer to wait for a particular type of loan to become available, Kiva allows you to save searches and be notified when new loans matching your search criteria become available on the website.To sign up for these alerts, you'll first need to sign in and save a search for that criteria. To do so, please go to: kiva.org/lend and use the search filters to find loans matching your preferences (using either the keyword search at the top of the page, or "Filters" on the left).When you're done click "Save this search" at the top of the page. A pop-up will appear where you can opt into receiving emails when loans within that search are posted.To manage your saved searches and email alerts later, just go to: kiva.org/lend/saved-search or use the drop-down menu on the "Lend" tab and click "Saved searches" under "My Kiva". If you can't find loans matching your preferences please continue to check back as new loans are posted every day.

Auto lending
How does auto-lending work?
Kiva's auto-lending tool enables you to make sure your funds are always active, even if you can't make a loan yourself. Lenders can customize the feature so that auto-lending happens automatically after repayments reach $25, or lenders can set a window of time (up to 4 months) to make a loan manually before auto-lending takes effect. Auto-loan categories, as well as other details, can also be customized to match your lending preferences.
Please note that the system gives precedence to active lending. The amount of loans being made through auto-lending depends on the supply of fundraising loans and demand from other lenders choosing loans manually. This also means that for popular or very specific kinds of loans, there's a chance those loans will be fully funded before auto-lending kicks in. Take this into account when customizing your loan preferences - if your criteria are too narrow, we may not be able to lend your funds.

Kiva's Response to COVID-19
Can I forgive a loan or request a deferral on repayments for a borrower due to COVID-19?
Your concern for borrowers is truly appreciated. While offers to forgive loans are very generous, Kiva's lending process and that of the Field Partners that facilitate loans are designed to accommodate loans and not donations. This means that all funding requests posted to Kiva are considered loans, and there unfortunately isn't a way to request that a borrower not repay your portion of the loan they received.  However, our Field Partners are working to address the current economic crisis with their borrowers. Kiva’s risk-tolerant capital grants Field Partners greater flexibility in rescheduling repayments and offering more impactful loan products during this time. For example, some Field Partners have begun to provide loans with a grace period on repayment, and to help borrowers refinance loans. Through the loan disbursement and collection process, our Field Partners remain deeply committed to client protection.While we are not able to defer repayments for individual borrowers, we do anticipate continued delays in repayment over the next few months and will stand by partners and borrowers during this time. Our hope is that lenders will choose to recycle repayments to continue helping more borrowers around the world during this crisis.Kiva is also developing new loan products that are designed to support borrowers and Field Partners through the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the Global COVID-19 Response fund, and Crisis Support Loans. You can learn more here: https://www.kiva.org/blog/introducing-crisis-support-loans-how-we-can-support-our-field-partners

Free credit
How does my free credit differ from Kiva credit?
Any free credit you receive is funded by a sponsor and can only be used to make loans.

Repayments on loans made using free credit are returned to the sponsor rather than you as the lender.
Help Center
>
Withdrawals
Why does it take so long for my withdrawal to complete?
Completing withdrawals via PayPal is a manual process, and as such takes longer than accepting funds. Kiva needs to manually compile all withdrawal requests, review them, and then send them to PayPal for processing. Depending on our capacity we try to process withdrawals once a week, meaning you'll most likely see these funds in your PayPal account this coming Friday. From time to time, however, withdrawal processing can be delayed (which is why the confirmation email you should have received said it can take 1-2 weeks).Once Kiva sends withdrawn funds to PayPal, you should be able to access them immediately.

This means that if you use a credit card via PayPal Guest Checkout or a PayPal account to make loans on Kiva, PayPal will process your payment and send you a receipt. If you're paying with a PayPal account, you will need to update the credit card associated with the account by logging into PayPal before going to Kiva and adding the new card details in the "Bank and cards" section of your account.If you have any trouble with your PayPal account, please visit their website at paypal.com/help or contact their customer service team at 888-445-5032 (Toll Free US) or 402-952-8811 (International) / Monday through Friday / 8AM-5PM CST.  If you choose the "Pay with card" option at checkout, you can enter your new credit card details directly, and there is an option to save your card.

Delinquency & default
What happens if a loan defaults?
In microfinance, it's common to try and reschedule delinquent loans in order to accommodate eventual repayment of the loan. However, despite these efforts to be flexible a loan will sometimes end in default. At Kiva, default (non-repayment) happens when:1. Kiva determines that collection of funds from a borrower or Field Partner is doubtful, or:2. The cumulative amount repaid as of our quarterly reconciliation process is less than what was expected as of 180 days prior, and when there have been no repayments reported to Kiva during this time.When a loan is defaulted, we notify all contributing lenders by email and these lenders can consider the remaining amount outstanding as a loss.

Borrower Verifications & Spot Checks

[NOTE TO SENDER: CC IM ON THIS EMAIL]I hope all is well at [PARTNER NAME]!It is now time for us to conduct your next Kiva Borrower Verification (BV). A BV is part of the regular operational monitoring that we conduct every 12 to 24 months with all of our Field Partners. The purpose is to confirm the accuracy of information published to the Kiva platform and verify compliance with our policies. In order to be most efficient for you and Kiva, we will do the Borrower Verification process remotely, meaning we will not actually visit the clients on site. As we also do with on site Borrower Verifications, we will select a sample of [5 OR 10] borrowers randomly and ask you to provide relevant documentation for these borrowers such as MIS reports, Client Waivers and loan contracts. For remote Borrower Verifications, it is necessary that we receive all of the requested information within 48 hours of our request. I want to choose a suitable date to send you the sample.Is [INSERT DATE HERE] acceptable for you? This means we would need the information to be returned to us by [INSERT DATE TWO DAYS LATER HERE].So you’re aware of what to expect of this process moving forward:On the pre-selected date, I will send you an email with the list of borrowers and the relevant information you will need to submit for each borrower within two business days. Once the requested documents have been received, I will review them, follow-up with any questions and submit a report for your Investment Manager to review.Your Investment Manager will review my report and communicate your final results to you, including any corrections or improvements that need to be made to your Kiva processes in order to remain compliant with Kiva's policies.For more information on Borrower Verifications, refer to this article in the PA2 Help Center.The BV is an important part of being a Kiva partner, so we thank you in advance for your cooperation throughout this process!

Interest rates
Why are your Field Partners' interest rates so high?
We often get questions about the interest and fees charged by our Field Partners, as the rates on Kiva are often higher than what lenders are used to seeing. The average interest rate charged by a partner is noted in the "Average Cost to Borrower" field on a loan profile. At Kiva we believe sustainability is critical to reaching more families and communities around the world, and charging interest to borrowers allows our Field Partners to cover the high operational costs of microfinance.
As only some partners pay a small fee for using Kiva as a platform for fundraising, Kiva loans provide our partners with the flexibility to reach more communities -- especially rural and/or underserved populations. Most Kiva Field Partners do charge interest in some form; however Kiva will not partner with an organization that charges unreasonable interest rates and we require our partners to fully disclose their rates. In addition, Kiva only partners with microfinance institutions and other organizations with a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved.
A couple of things to consider when thinking about interest rates:
1. Because many of our partners serve rural communities, the labor of distributing and collecting loan payments can add to their operating expenses
2. Comparisons of interest rates in developed countries with those in developing countries can be misleading. A developed banking system can provide funds at lower rates, and when a bank facilitates larger loans its transactional expenses are reduced. Microfinance is an expensive business, which is part of the reason why big banks don't provide small loans in the first place.
3. Developing countries typically have high inflation rates which need to be factored into a partner's interest rates. For example, an interest rate of 13% per year in a country where the inflation rate was 15% per year would not cover costs.
We also list our Field Partners' return on assets (ROA) on their partner pages (kiva.org/partners) so lenders can see how much money the partner is making based off the loans they're providing. ROA is a measure of profitability, and our partners currently average a negative ROA.

Updates
I received a journal update with an incorrect translation/untranslated. Can you translate it?
Updates on borrowers are usually provided by Kiva's Field Partners and are often written in their native language. We unfortunately don't have the resource to translate every update by hand, and while some Field Partners use a translation software to provide updates in English, it is not required.From time to time there are minor errors in translation, but we hope the partner's message still comes across clear enough for lenders to understand. In this case, since the update has not been translated, we'd be happy to run it through Google translate for you, which is a tool that you can use to translate any updates going forward.

Expirations
Why do loans expire on the Kiva website?
Kiva allows lenders to make choices about who they support with their Kiva credit. Every loan has 30 days to become fully funded, and many loans are funded within a matter of days.
Loans fundraise on either a flexible or fixed funding model. Flexible means that any funds raised will be sent to the field, whereas fixed funding loans are returned to contributing lenders if the full amount is not reached within the fundraising period. Any previous mention of "Expiring soon" will now be labeled "Ending soon" to include both models of funding.

Monthly Good
How does Monthly Good differ from auto deposit?
While Monthly Good and auto deposit are both recurring contributions to Kiva, they function a bit differently.
When you sign up for Monthly Good, your balance will be automatically lent to borrowers on Kiva as soon as you have $25+ in your account.
As a Monthly Good contributor, you’ll receive an inspiring email from Kiva once a month telling you whom you supported and why it mattered, but will not receive other emails related to your loans, such as repayment notifications or updates. Additionally, Monthly Good gives you the option to make recurring contributions with card payments or your PayPal account, while auto deposit contributions can only be made through PayPal.
When you sign up for auto deposit, funds will be added to your account on a monthly basis, and available for you to lend to the borrowers of your choosing. You can also choose to enable auto-lending on your account, to automatically have your funds lent out to borrowers according to your lending preferences.

Interest rates
Does Kiva charge interest?
Kiva never collects interest on loans and lenders do not receive interest from the loans they fund. However, many of our Field Partners do charge some interest to borrowers. Self-sustainability is critical to creating long-term solutions to poverty, and charging interest is often necessary for our partners to achieve this. While our Field Partners are free to charge interest, Kiva will not partner with an organization that charges exorbitant interest rates and we require our partners to fully disclose their rates. You can find more information about the interest rates charged by a partner on their Field Partner page (kiva.org/partners) as well as on each loan profile. Microfinance is an expensive business, which is essentially why small loans aren't provided by large banks. Charging interest to borrowers enables our Field Partners to bear these costs and achieve self-sustainability.

Social underwriting & risk
How does Kiva U.S. manage delinquent loans?
Loans are marked as delinquent when a borrower has repaid less than owed to date, as agreed upon with their repayment schedule. In traditional finance, borrowers can be subjected to high interest rates, late fees, and inflexible collection methods. Kiva U.S. takes a more empathetic approach with our direct lending program in the United States. When Kiva U.S. loans become delinquent, our team follows up with the borrower and Trustee (if applicable) to create an open channel of communication with the goal of understanding the delinquency. In the case of changed circumstances or business struggle, we work to create a new repayment schedule they can follow toward eventual repayment of their loan, while also encouraging them to update their lenders. Our U.S. team sets the expectation that the borrower repays their loan in full even if the business continues to struggle. For more detailed information on delinquency management, please check out this blog post: kiva.org/businesscenter/human-centered-risk-management Our U.S. team may post comments on the loan from time to time, but due to time and staffing constraints can't commit to doing so regularly for every loan. As a lender you're more than welcome to post a comment on loans you've supported as well. In doing so, the borrower may respond and provide more details into the challenges they're facing.

Field Partner basics
What's a Field Partner?
Kiva is able to reach more borrowers in some of the most remote places around the world through our global network of Field Partners. These partners are local organizations working in communities to vet borrowers, disburse loans, collect repayments, provide services and administer loans on the ground in general. Our Field Partners are nonprofit organizations, microfinance institutions, schools, and social enterprises. Many provide services alongside their loans, such as entrepreneurial training or finanical literacy development. Our partners all share one thing in common: a desire to improve people's lives through access to safe and affordable credit. You can see a list of Kiva Field Partners here: kiva.org/partners

Currency exchange loss
What does "Partner covers currency loss" mean & how could it affect my Kiva loans?
When lending internationally, the local currency in a borrower's country may lose some of its value compared to the US dollar -- requiring the partner to use more of its local currency to repay Kiva in USD. We offer some Field Partners the option to protect themselves against currency fluctuations by choosing to pass on these losses to Kiva lenders. By bearing this risk, lenders protect the partner and its borrowers from catastrophic currency devaluations and contribute to the sustainability of their operations.Potential for currency exchange loss is noted on every loan profile under the loan details:"Yes" means the Field Partner will cover any currency loss. Lenders will not bear losses due to currency fluctuation "Partial" means that the Field Partner has opted to cover losses only up to 10%. If the U.S. dollar appreciates more than 10% against the local currency, those losses will be passed onto lenders."No" means that the Field Partner is not covering any currency losses and all losses will be passed onto lenders."N/A" means the Field Partner disburses loans to borrowers in USD so their loans are not subject to any currency fluctuation.

Repayments
How does Kiva’s repayment system work?
Kiva’s repayment system is designed to accurately reflect the way that our Field Partners collect funds from borrowers in the field.When one of Kiva’s Field Partners uploads a borrower’s loan request to Kiva, they set the anticipated repayment dates for the loan and the date that the loan is set to be disbursed to the borrower. Our Field Partners have until the end of the month that each anticipated repayment is due to let Kiva know whether or not they actually collected the repayment. Once we have all of this information, we use it to generate a bill to charge our Field Partners for all of the repayments they collected that month. Because we work on a net billing system with our partners, it means that for any given month we subtract the amount of repayments that a partner owes to lenders from the amount that a partner fundraises for new loans on the Kiva website. If the balance is positive, that means that the Field Partner has raised more than they need to repay, and we use those funds to credit lender account with the repayments due and send the remaining amount to the Field Partner via wire transfer. If the balance is negative, then the Field Partner has 30 days to send us a payment for the balance. As soon as we receive that payment, we use those funds to credit lenders account with the repayments due. Once the repayment is made into a lender's Kiva account, they can choose to relend the funds, donate them to Kiva’s operating expenses, purchase a Kiva Card or withdraw them into a PayPal account. Please note that Kiva's repayment system doesn't take into account transactions between the Field Partner and the borrower that do not involve Kiva, such as interest payments, fees paid or any mandatory savings.

What can fundraise
Why does Kiva allow loans to be posted when they're for non-sustainable farming methods?
While the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides isn't necessarily an environmentally friendly practice or proven to be the most sustainable method of farming, we allow borrowers who use these types of products to be posted on Kiva because it's such a normal and necessary practice in many parts of the developing world. Until cheap, sustainable ways of growing and harvesting crops are more common in these regions, people are likely to continue using these products and farming methods. This issue introduces a much greater development challenge that Kiva can't take on alone, but we certainly hope that sustainable methods of farming will become more commonplace in the developing world in the future. We have a sector on our website for "Green" loans, which may help you to better find borrowers whose activities are related to sustainable farming methods, solar power, wind power, biofuels or energy efficiency. As we grow we hope to continue to expand our green loan offerings so there will be more loans for organic and sustainable farming on Kiva. You can find green loans by going to: www.kiva.org/lend?attribute=1 There is also a tag for "Sustainable Ag" that you can find on the Filters menu, or at this link: www.kiva.org/lend?tag=8If you know of any organizations working in the area of sustainable agriculture who you think would make a great Kiva Field Partner please encourage them to check out our partner criteria at: kiva.org/partners/info

Does Kiva charge a fee when I lend?
Kiva never takes a fee from lenders, which means 100% of the funds you lend on Kiva go to supporting borrowers’ loans.
We support our operations through optional donations from our lending community and it's estimated that for every $1 donated to Kiva's operating expenses, we are ablt to facilitate $8 in loans to borrowers.
When you check out on Kiva with a loan, you'll see an optional donation automatically added to your basket. If you'd like to change this donation amount, you can do so on the "Basket" page by clicking the pencil icon next to the donation amount. Enter a custom amount or click "No donation to Kiva" and submit your changes. When checking out with a Kiva Card or donation, you can edit the amount directly and click "Update".

What is Kiva's international response to COVID-19?
We are monitoring developments around the world for our Field Partners in other countries, and are in close contact with them to assess operational impacts. We expect to see our Field Partners introduce flexible payment terms to accommodate quarantine measures. These measures would be taken to ease the impact their operations and their borrowers’ businesses have experienced as reduced economic activity follows COVID-19. In the aftermath of the crisis, Kiva will support Field Partners in their efforts to design new loan products tailored to help borrowers recover and restart their businesses.
While offers to forgive loans are generous, our system was built to accommodate loans not donations. This means that all funding requests posted to Kiva are considered loans, and there unfortunately isn't a way to request that a borrower not repay your portion of the loan they received.
Kiva has set up a Global COVID-19 Response fund in order to engage lenders in an effort to help borrowers and Field Partners make it through the challenges brought on by COVID-19. We believe this community has an important role to play, as credit is an appropriate tool to address the immediate crisis Field Partners and borrowers are facing. We have also launched a new product, called Crisis Support Loans.

Updates
Why didn't I receive an update on why my loan is delinquent?
Thank you for your interest in learning more about the status of your loan. The updates lenders receive about borrowers are written by our Field Partners, and we highly encourage partners to post updates about how borrowers are doing. However, we understand they have their own time and staffing constraints so we don't require them to do so.One of the reasons updates can be difficult to obtain is because many borrowers live in remote and difficult-to-reach locations, and the flow of information between borrower and Kiva can be lengthy and costly. A borrower may only interact with a loan officer, who would then need to report that information back to the branch manager, who would then have to report that information back to the Kiva Coordinator at the partner's main office, who would then translate the information and post it to the Kiva website.If receiving updates on borrowers is important to you, you may want to lend through Field Partners with a reputation for posting updates. You can check out the journaling rate of a Field Partner by clicking on “More about [the partner’s name]” in the Field Partner section of a loan, or by checking this list: kiva.org/partners (scroll down on the partner's profile to see their journaling rate).

How does loan matching work?
Loans marked with a "x2" icon on Kiva's website will be eligible for matching funds from our sponsors, which means that if you lend $25 to that borrower, a fund set up by the loan matcher will also lend $25 to that borrower -- essentially doubling the contribution made to that loan and helping it reach its goal. Repayments on the matched amount, however, will return to the sponsor not to your Kiva account. Please note, while loans with a "x2" icon on them should be matched by a sponsor, we do not guarantee that all loans will be matched. Matching will occur as long as matching funds are available that meet the criteria of that loan and the matched amount does not exceed the total loan amount.

How lending works
Can I support the same borrower more than once?
Borrowers may take out successive or concurrent loans on Kiva, and when they do we encourage Field Partners to use a feature called "relisting" to post them on the website, which notifies lenders who've previously supported that borrower by email.If you subscribe to loan updates (www.kiva.org/settings/email), you should receive notices when a borrower you've lent to in the past posts a new loan. You can also filter loans by the Repeat borrower tag to find all borrowers who have had a previous loan on Kiva: https://www.kiva.org/lend?tag=28

Kiva Card basics
My Kiva Card converted into a donation, can you change it back so I can use it for loans?
A Kiva Card is a gift product that combines the ability to make both a loan and a donation to Kiva. When you give a Kiva Card, you give someone else the chance to make a loan to a borrower who inspires them. When their loan is repaid, they can use those funds again and again to make even more loans on Kiva. If the recipient does not use their Kiva Card within 12 months of the purchase date the funds are automatically converted into a donation to Kiva's operating expenses.Unfortunately, once a Kiva Card is converted into a donation there's no way to reverse the donation or apply those funds toward a Kiva loan. Please be assured that these funds are still being put to good use, as every $1 donated to Kiva helps us raise $8 in loans.For more information, please review the Kiva Card terms and conditions: kiva.org/gifts/kiva-cards/terms

Interest rates
How does Kiva ensure its Field Partners are offering fair and appropriate interest rates?
Kiva chooses to partner only with organizations that have a strong commitment to serving the needs of poor, vulnerable and/or excluded populations, either through financial services or by using credit to expand access to beneficial products and services. We also require that all of our Field Partners endorse the Smart Campaign's Client Protection Principles (smartcampaign.org/about/smart-microfinance-and-the-client-protection-principles), an industry-wide initiative to establish a baseline for responsible microfinance. So far, the vast majority of our partners have endorsed the principles, helping safeguard borrowers against over-indebtedness and ensure transparent pricing for borrowers.We ensure that our partners are adhering to the "responsible pricing" principle by reviewing their audited financial statements and calculating the return on assets (ROA) and Average Cost to Borrower, adjusted for inflation. Our Field Partners with the highest cost to borrowers and return on assets, in addition to those with a real ROA above 5% and a Field Partner Premium (Field Partner Premium = portfolio yield adjusted for inflation - financial expense) above 30%, are subject to additional scrutiny, such as collecting compensation information for executive staff, reviewing loan schedules and calculating APR on all loan products.Based on this information, Kiva has chosen to exit relationships with partners where the justification for their pricing could not be established.

Lending amounts
Can I lend more than $25?
Lenders on Kiva can lend any amount in increments of $25. On each loan profile you'll see a drop-down box under the borrower's name, which gives you different options for how much you want to lend. The default is $25 but you can click the box to select a different amount. Select the amount you wish to lend and click "Lend now" to add the loan to your basket.
If you'd like to lend more than $500 just add the loan to your basket at any amount and proceed to the "Basket" page. There you'll see another drop-down box that will allow you to contribute up to the total amount left.

Loan details
Why do the loan descriptions from certain Field Partners seem so similar?
The loan descriptions on Kiva's website are written by our Field Partners. To help the staff at our partners, who may not have English as a first language, our team will sometimes provide loan description templates. These templates help make it easier for our Field Partners to draft loan descriptions by allowing them to fill in different facts about the borrower, such as number of children, marital status, etc. Because some of our partners have and use these templates, you may see similarities in the style of different loan descriptions from the same Field Partner. While these similarities shouldn't be cause for alarm, please know that Kiva does use a process called borrower verification to to confirm the accuracy of the information included in borrower profiles. To read more about this process, please check out this Fellows Blog: https://www.kiva.org/blog/on-the-road-again-borrower-visits-throughout-southern-uganda

Risk & due diligence
What is a risk rating?
There are many levels of risk associated with Kiva loans, which are explained on our website here: kiva.org/about/riskThe Field Partner risk rating reflects the risk of institutional default associated with each of Kiva’s Field Partners. A 0.5-star rating means the organization has a relatively higher risk of institutional default, while a 5-star rating indicates the organization is at a relatively lower risk of default, based on Kiva's analysis and the available information displayed in the Field Partner section of every loan. Field Partners with the lowest credit tier undergo a lighter level of due diligence and do not receive a risk rating; instead, in places where a risk rating would normally appear, these partners are labeled as “Experimental.” For more information, see "What is an Experimental Field Partner?"Direct loans also do not receive a formal risk rating. Instead, these loans are approved through “social underwriting”, where trustworthiness is determined by friends & family lending a portion of the loan request, or by a Kiva approved Trustee vouching for the borrower. Direct loans will appear as "Unrated" and lenders should always assume these loans represent the highest level of repayment risk on Kiva.

How does Kiva ensure that loans aren't over-indebting borrowers?
At Kiva we take concerns about over-indebtedness and client protection very seriously. We have directed a significant portion of our resources to foster responsible microfinance at all of our Field Partners around the world and do so through due diligence, monitoring, and staffing. A great place to read more about our efforts and approach is on our website here: kiva.org/about/socialperformanceKiva seeks to partner with organizations that have a strong social mission, and when conducting due diligence on potential Field Partners we favor organizations that excel in:1. Client protection (especially when it comes to the prevention of over-indebtedness) fair and transparent pricing, good collection practices, and the security of client information2. Outreach that ensures vital services reach the poor, unbanked, and under-served3. Innovative loan products, savings, and non-financial services specifically tailored to the needs of the target group4. Measuring outcomes in the lives of borrowersMany of our partners are chosen because not only do they lend money, but they also
offer services such as savings accounts, financial literacy training, and empowerment
programs.Please note as well that we conduct social audits of all active partners to ensure we (and they) understand their strengths and weaknesses as an organization. Kiva's Field Partners include both for-profit and non-profit institutions, and all must have interest rates that are comparable to other institutions in their region. Kiva has also chosen to endorse and promote the Smart Campaign's Client Protection Principles (smartcampaign.org/about/smart-microfinance-and-the-client-protection-principles), an industry-wide initiative to establish a baseline for responsible microfinance. To post loans on Kiva, all our partners must endorse the campaign (or provide justification for why their standards effectively meet the same requirements). Lastly, we have dedicated staff responsible for selecting, servicing, and monitoring our Field Partners. This investment of resources reflects Kiva's commitment to working with the right organizations. Kiva staff themselves are selected from a competitive pool to ensure excellence, accountability, and commitment to our mission of connecting people through lending to alleviate poverty.

Expirations
What happens if a loan doesn't fully fund on Kiva?
Kiva loans have 30 days to become fully funded. If a loan is unsuccessful in doing so, it expires and all lenders have their contributions returned to their available credit.
The borrower actually isn't directly affected in the case of most partner loans. If their loan expires, most Field Partners will use their own capital to fund the loan. There are some situations, however, where borrowers will not receive their loan if it expires. This happens with direct loans and partner loans that are not pre-disbursed, or when the Field Partner does not have the resources to cover the loan.
We know it can be hard to see a loan expire, which is why we're working hard every day to grow our community of lenders making positive impacts in the lives of Kiva borrowers and their communities.

How can I minimize my risk of currency loss?
Currency exchange losses will be a possibility for most loans on Kiva’s site. However, some Field Partners choose to bear this risk themselves instead of passing it on to lenders. Lenders can learn more about the level of risk associated with each loan by referring to the currency risk section on the loan profile page.
Lenders can also choose how much risk they’d like to take on by filtering their loan search in Advanced filters (kiva.org/lend) with the checkbox labeled “Exclude loans with currency risk.” This will narrow the search to loans without the risk of currency loss.
To minimize currency risk, lenders can also diversify their portfolio across various countries. This helps to limit exposure to currency losses in any one region.

Interest rates
Do Kiva borrowers pay any interest on their loans?
Yes, most Kiva borrowers do pay interest to our Field Partners in some form. Kiva and Kiva lenders themselves do not receive interest on these loans.Our partners collect interest from borrowers because there are many operational expenses associated with microfinance in developing markets, especially in rural areas. Many of Kiva's Field Partners also provide additional services alongside their loan products such as business training, financial literacy lessons, or health services. Kiva will not partner with an organization that charges unreasonable interest rates, and we require Field Partners to fully disclose their rates. In addition, we only partner with microfinance institutions and organizations that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked, and underserved. There are some 0% interest loans on Kiva, including all direct loans in the United States. To learn more about the interest rates Kiva borrowers pay, you can review the "Average cost to borrower" field on a loan profile.

If you are using a non-U.S. credit card, you can select "Pay by card" tab next to the PayPal login screen and pay without any additional fees beyond what your credit card or bank charge for international transactions.

Loan matching
What is loan matching?
Loan matching is a feature that allows the loan you make on Kiva to be matched by an individual or larger organization that has set up a loan matching fund. If you lend $25 to a borrower whose loan is being matched, the matcher will lend $25 to that borrower as well. Matchers may match all Kiva loans or just a particular type of loans (loans in a certain area, through a particular Field Partner, to a particular type of borrower, etc.). To find loans that are eligible for matching, look for a x2 icon on the loan, or search for these loans using this direct link: www.kiva.org/lend?matchedOnly=true

What type of monitoring does Kiva do with its Field Partners?
Kiva conducts routine monitoring of our Field Partners, including:-- With the exception of certain safety-related travel restrictions, Field Partners are physically visited by staff at Kiva at a frequency that corresponds with the amount of funding they are allowed to raise on the Kiva platform (i.e. partners with a larger credit limit are visited more frequently).-- Many Field Partners also host Kiva Fellows who expand Kiva's on-the-ground ability to monitor and support our partners. To learn more about the Fellows Program, please visit: kiva.org/fellows-- Each year Kiva reviews in detail the financial statements and relevant ratios of each Field Partner (with the exception of experimental partners). -- If a Field Partner has been given a risk rating, that rating is updated 1x per year with the most recently available qualitative and quantitative information.-- Kiva conducts periodic audits of a sample of each Field Partner's borrowers posted to Kiva, which is a process called borrower verification.-- Kiva examines each Field Partner's loan pricing on an annual basis, and if we learn that a partner is charging borrowers a higher than usual rate, we collect extra details about the Field Partner and the country to better understand the decision-making and context behind this pricing.As part of our ongoing monitoring, we may discover potential issues of concern at a partner. In these cases, we work to investigate and, if possible, resolve the issues as quickly as possible. While we investigate we may, at times, pause a partner’s ability to raise funds and/or delay the timing of distribution of collected repayment to lenders until the investigation is resolved. If a partnership is paused, we will share more information with lenders via the partner page: kiva.org/partners

Why is there a difference between my total deposits and total amount lent?
The total amount lent listed in your portfolio is the sum of funds that you have applied to Kiva loans, which includes loans made using repaid Kiva credit. For example: if you deposit $25 to make a loan, get repaid, and then make another $25 loan with those repayments, then your total amount lent will be $50 but only $25 is still due to return to you.You can see the total amount you've deposited into Kiva at: kiva.org/portfolioYou can also review your transaction history at kiva.org/portfolio/transactions (to see deposits only, use the pull-down menu to select "Deposits" and sort your transactions).

Loan details
Why is the loan listed for a woman when the description says the it's for her husband?
There are some microfinance institutions that make loans to women for use of the entire family in order to support their family business. In many of the communities where our borrowers live, women have no role at all in the family business. In order to empower these women, the Field Partner will lend money to a woman to help grow her family's business. Even if her husband runs the day-to-day operations, the wife becomes their money manager and is responsible for the loan -- making repayments and applying for any future loans.Our hope is that this will give women a direct role in the business, which she may never have had before. Many of these women, after establishing a good repayment history, can use this history to get a loan of their own and work to establish their own businesses. That said, we know lenders have different preferences for how to use their money on Kiva. If you're not compelled by these stories, I'd encourage you to continue contributing to loans that better align with your preferences. If you're explicitly looking for woman-owned business, please use our "Woman Owned Biz" tag: kiva.org/lend?tag=6

Why do loan repayments come back to Kiva on dedicated loans?
Loan dedications allowed Kiva lenders to make two gifts for the price of one. When you dedicated a loan, you were able to both honor a friend or family member by supporting a loan in their name while also supporting Kiva with a donation to our operating expenses. For this reason all dedicated loan repayments are automatically donated to Kiva rather than returned to your account.

Can I post a borrower's photo or information on my own website?
We appreciate lenders' interest in spreading the word about Kiva on their own websites, however we unfortunately cannot grant permission to copy borrower information or photos to other websites.
Kiva borrowers have all signed a form granting permission for their photo and story to be published on Kiva’s websites, but not elsewhere on the Internet. One of Kiva’s core values is respect, and we strive to respect our borrowers by limiting their information to Kiva’s own sites.
Instead of copying information from Kiva onto your website, we encourage you to link directly to loan profiles on Kiva, or to your public lender page, which shows all the loans you've supported. This way, your website visitors can still read about Kiva borrowers, but the information is being displayed in a way that the borrowers themselves have agreed to. You can access your lender page by going to: kiva.org/portfolio and clicking the link “Public lender profile” link in the menu bar. You can then copy and paste your unique lender profile URL to post on your own website.
Thanks so much for understanding and for your support of borrowers around the world through Kiva.

Repayments
How do repayments get back to lenders?
Loan funds are repaid from borrowers to lenders through Kiva's Field Partners, or by utilizing PayPal. For partner loans, local Field Partners collect repayments from the borrowers, based on each loan repayment schedule and the borrower's ability to repay. The partner then repays Kiva and repayments are deposited into your individual Kiva lender account. This typically happens on a monthly basis. Lenders should be aware that this introduces a layer of risk: repayment of Field Partner loans relies on the borrower repaying the Field Partner, and the Field Partner repaying Kiva. For direct loans, borrowers use PayPal to transmit repayments and Kiva deposits repaid funds into your individual Kiva lender account. Lenders should be aware that this model introduces a different kind of risk: there is no Field Partner working on the ground to follow up with the borrower and encourage or collect repayments. In either case, as you're repaid you can withdraw your money, donate it to Kiva, or relend it to another borrower. Learn more about the risks of lending on our website here: kiva.org/about/risk

Impact
How does Kiva measure impact?
Kiva has developed a multi-method approach to measuring impact across its wide, Field Partner-driven, portfolio.  This approach incorporates external data (i.e. poverty and financial exclusion data from the World Bank, robust evaluation evidence of impact of loans) and data we intentionally go out and collect ourselves (at both the partner and borrower level) to inform the following key questions:1. Who are we reaching?  Are our borrowers poor, marginalized, or otherwise financially excluded?2. How well do our loan products serve our borrowers?  What loan attributes or features are known to make the biggest impact?3. Are our Field Partners aligned with us in both mission and practice?  Do they understand, track, and report on their impact at the borrower-level?  What is the quality of the service they provide and how do they maintain it?We have an impact measurement system that quantifies each of these 3 major components into a targeting score, product impact score, and partner process quality score.  These scores inform whether we’ll work with a particular organization, and if so, which products to provide to which borrowers.
Additionally, Kiva regularly partners with foundations, academic institutions, and research institutions to design and conduct larger studies. This includes impact evaluations within our Field Partner portfolios (i.e. the impact of a riskier loan type at Partner X) as well as broad, multi-stakeholder impact assessments (i.e. data on borrower households, financial histories, businesses, and longer-term impact of loans).
We are currently evaluating how to better share all of the above with more transparency and frequency throughout the Kiva website, content pieces, and other channels, to highlight the work we’re already doing more publicly. For now, you can read a bit more about our approach to impact on our website here: kiva.org/about/impact

Delinquency & default
How does Kiva define default?
In microfinance it's common to try rescheduling delinquent or defaulted loans to accommodate eventual repayment of the loan. At Kiva we define default (non-repayment) as the time when Kiva determines repayment from a borrower (or partner) is doubtful, or when the cumulative amount repaid as of our quarterly reconciliation is less than the amount expected 180 days prior (with no repayments reported to Kiva during that time). Kiva typically processes defaults on a quarterly basis for partner loans, and on a monthly basis for direct loans (however, case by case exceptions may be made if future repayments are possible). Field Partners also have the option to default loans at any time should they determine further repayments are unlikely. When a Kiva loan defaults all lenders are notified by email.

Expirations
How does loan expiration affect the borrower?
In many cases, when a loan expires on Kiva the borrower isn't negatively affected. For partner loans, it's common for Field Partners to use their own capital to fund a loan before posting it on Kiva and then backfill that amount with funds provided by lenders.
In these cases, while a loan expiration may not directly impact the borrower, it can sometimes negatively impact the partner -- especially if they continue to experience a large number of expirations that reduce the availability of their capital reserves.
Direct loans are made without a Field Partner, so if these loans expire, the borrowers will not receive any funding from Kiva lenders.

How Kiva works
Can I forgive loans to borrowers who have been affected by a natural disaster?
While offers to forgive loans are very generous, Kiva's lending process is designed to accommodate loans and not donations. This means that all funding requests posted to Kiva are considered loans, and there unfortunately isn't a way to request that a borrower not repay your portion of the loan they received.
Instead, we rely on our Field Partners to let us know which borrowers are affected in the event of a natural disaster. If a borrower you've supported has been affected and can no longer repay their loan, the partner administering the loan may not require them to repay and in that case will hopefully notify you by email with an update.

Why don't my estimated repayments accurately represent my outstanding loans?
The estimated repayments noted in your Kiva portfolio (kiva.org/portfolio/estimated-repayments) are calculated based on the original repayment schedule for each of your loans. These estimates don't account for delinquencies, defaults, currency loss, or for when borrowers pay more than was scheduled and the principal has been paid down. This means that if a borrower ends up making repayments early on their loan, this early repayment will not be reflected in the estimated repayments schedule. For example, if a borrower ended up paying back their loan in full in February, but wasn't scheduled to be paid back until May, it would still show up as a portion of the estimated repayments for May. The amount repaid in February wouldn't be removed from your estimated repayments just because it was paid back early.

Kiva U.S. is a lending program through which lenders make loans directly to borrowers in the United States. Unlike partner loans, direct loans are not facilitated through a Field Partner, so they carry higher risk, but are also benefiting entrepreneurs who are financially excluded or having a social impact in their communities.This program was originally launched as a pilot in November 2011 under the name Kiva Zip, and graduated out of beta in June 2016.

Lending team basics
How do I set my preferred lending team?
If you're a member of more than 1 lending team, you may want to set a preferred lending team, which will be the default team listed in your basket, making it easy to count your loans toward your team's impact automatically, whether you are lending manually or via auto-lending. You can set your preferred team by signing into your Kiva account and going to My Teams (kiva.org/teams/my-teams)
Under the headline "Lending Teams I Belong To" you'll see
a pulldown box where you can set your preferred team next to the team of your choice.

Loan disbursal
If my loan is pre-disbursed, is the money I lend on Kiva going to support the borrower I choose?
We get this question often, and here’s what we want to make clear: although your loan may be pre-disbursed, there is a direct 1:1 relationship between you and the borrower you choose to support. If you lend money to Tarek in Lebanon, for example, to purchase seeds for his farm, those funds are going to cover the pre-disbursed loan to Tarek. In addition, your repayment is 100% tied to his repayment. If Tarek makes a loan repayment, that repayment will be passed along to you. If he doesn't make a payment, the Field Partner will let us know that and you won't get repaid. This establishes a true financial link between lenders and the borrowers they choose to support.To learn more about this, you can also check out this extensive Q&A which also talks a bit more about disbursal dates for Kiva loans: blog.kiva.org/faqs/direct-loans-qa

What can fundraise
Does Kiva prohibit certain businesses from fundraising on Kiva?
At Kiva we trust our Field Partners to determine whether or not a loan request is appropriate. We only prohibit loans for business activities that are illegal in the borrower's country or violate major UN conventions. We trust our partners to make these decisions because they're familiar with the communities and cultures where borrowers live and work. A loan that is inappropriate to one person may be perfectly reasonable in another cultural context.We understand some lenders are less comfortable supporting these loans than others, and we always recommend lenders exercise their consumer choice in selecting loans that match their values and preferences. If a specific kind of loan product continues to expire before it can be fully funded then our partners know they shouldn't post loans of that nature in the future.

Risk & due diligence
What is borrower verification?
Borrower verification is a process Kiva uses to verify the accuracy of the information included in the borrower profiles posted on the Kiva website. To conduct a borrower verification, a Kiva staff member or Kiva Fellow obtains a random sample of 10 borrowers. The Kiva representative must then obtain contact information for each selected borrower, including instructions on how and where to locate them. If necessary, the Kiva representative will arrange for a Field Partner employee to visit the borrowers with them. When visiting borrowers, the Kiva's representative will confirm the borrower's identity by checking it against the name on their national ID card, voter registration card or utility bill. They must visually compare the borrower to their profile photo on Kiva and take a photograph of the borrower during the visit. Kiva's representative must also obtain a copy of the borrower’s loan activity record and compare it to the loan information entered on their Kiva profile, making sure that the disbursal date, the loan amount and the loan term match on both records. They must also verify the profile details listed on Kiva and the borrower's repayment history as it is reported to Kiva. Lastly, they will verify the client waiver and make sure that the borrower signed the loan description and photo waiver. Once the borrower verification is completed, the Kiva representative will write up a report for Kiva's Portfolio Team. Borrower verification reports are used to monitor our Field Partners and make sure that the loans being posted on Kiva are for real people and contain accurate information on the borrowers.Many of our Kiva Fellows have blogged about their experience conducting borrower verifications, which you can read about here:fellowsblog.kiva.org/fellowsblog/tags/borrower-verification

How lending works
How does the money for the loan get to each borrower?
Loan funds reach borrowers through Kiva's Field Partners or PayPal, depending on the type of loan.
For most loans on Kiva, our local Field Partners are responsible for distributing the funds to borrowers. Depending on the Field Partner, the funds may be given to each borrower before, during or after the individual loan is posted on Kiva. Most partners give the funds out before the loan is posted (which is called pre-disbursal) because it allows borrowers to use the funds immediately. When a lender supports a partner-facilitated loan on Kiva, the borrower may already have those funds in hand. However, support for that loan is still needed to backfill the loan and allow the partner to sustain their operations. As the borrower makes repayments, they're passed along to the specific Kiva lenders who supported the loan, securing a true lender-borrower connection.
With Field Partners, Kiva sends lender funds by international wire to the respective Field Partner. This process happens on a monthly basis. To speed things up and to minimize the number of wire transfers being sent overseas, Kiva works on a net billing system. That means, for any given month, we subtract the amount of repayments that a Field Partner owes to Kiva lenders from the amount that a partner fundraises for new loans on Kiva, and either the Field Partner or Kiva sends a wire of funds for the difference.
For direct loans, once the loan is fully crowdfunded on Kiva, funds are transmitted to the borrower via PayPal.

Withdrawals

We have put a number of filters in place which allow us to check for unauthorized activity, as well as unloaned Kiva credit (which needs to be refunded to the original method of payment rather than manually withdrawn -- see: Kiva Withdrawal Policy). Our systems tends to block withdrawals if you've requested more than you've been repaid, multiple withdrawals to the same PayPal account, or a withdrawal to a PayPal account you haven't deposited from before.That said, please note that blocking withdrawals simply flags them for our finance team to review. They do not take any longer to process than unblocked withdrawals, as all requests are uploaded to PayPal at the same time every week.

Direct lending basics
How does the private fundraising period work?
When a loan is approved for fundraising, it's first posted on the website in a 15-day Private Fundraising Period (PFP). During the PFP, the borrower must recruit a given number of lenders from their personal network to lend as little as $25 to their loan and kickstart their fundraising. Once the required number of lenders has been reached, the loan will graduate into a 30-day public fundraising period, where it will then be publicly viewable by our worldwide community of lenders. The private fundraising period is the last step of our social underwriting process and Kiva uses it as a means to assess creditworthiness. Instead of asking for collateral, we choose to rely on a borrower's social capital to determine whether or not they?re able to access a loan. To learn more about PFP, please visit the Borrowers Hub at http://www.kivaushub.org/fundraising-disbursals

How are mixed-gender group loans categorized?
The gender of groups is determined by the group majority. That means that group loans are designated as female if more than half the borrowers in the group are women. If more than half of the borrowers are men, the group will be categorized as a male loan. Even if the group leader is a male and/or the description is of a male borrower in the group, as long as more than half the borrowers in the group are women, then the loan will be categorized as a female loan.

Does Kiva earn interest on lenders' funds?
Kiva only earns nominal interest (less that 0.5 percent) on the balances in lenders' accounts. All Kiva lender funds sit in an escrow-like account called "Kiva User Funds" which is a FDIC insured, low-yielding “For Benefit of Others (FBO)” account that we administer. Kiva set up this FBO account so that Kiva users’ funds (meant for lending) are fully separate from Kiva’s operational funds as a nonprofit (Kiva Microfunds) and protected. Kiva also doesn't make money on the loans we facilitate through our website. Instead, we rely on donations. The majority of donations to Kiva Microfunds are given by our lenders in addition to the loans they make on the Kiva website. They do this because they believe in Kiva and the work that we’re doing, and recognize it takes infrastructure to make this work in 80+ countries. A large majority of the rest of our donation income is provided by foundations, who encourage us to create innovative programs to serve the poor more effectively (see: kiva.org/about/supportus/supporters).At the end of 2012, Kiva had $31.3 million in cash for Kiva Credit value, which is the total of user cash balances that have yet to be lent by Kiva lenders. And in 2012 Kiva received about $50,000 in interest on this FBO account. That interest helped to pay for things like transaction fees to transfer those funds to the field (and in 2012, the transaction fees on these funds were about $30,000). So in total, Kiva earned roughly $20,000 from the bank, net of transaction fees. (And for reference, our operational costs in 2012 were around $14.2 million.) This reflects our philosophy that we shouldn't put our lenders’ capital at risk, and instead should be as conservative as possible in safeguarding those funds.For more information about Kiva's finances, we publish our yearly audited financials on our website here: kiva.org/about/finances

Loan details
Why is a man pictured if the loan says it's for a woman?
There are a few cases where a man might be featured in the photo when the loan is for a woman. Some Kiva borrowers live in conservative areas in which women are not comfortable having their photographs on the internet. In order to honor female borrowers' modesty and protect their privacy, we allow a family member to be pictured on their loan profile. The loan will be used by the borrower described, rather than by the man pictured. In these cases, information about why a male family member is being pictured should be described in the loan description. There are also group loans that have a majority of female borrowers and are listed as to "women" but feature a male borrower in the photo. This depends on who in the group is available for a photo at the time when the partner is posting loan profiles. You should be able to read a list of names of all the group members on the loan page, the majority of which should be women.

Why do group loan amounts seem so high?
In a group loan, the loan amount you see is the full amount of the group loan, with each member receiving a portion of that amount. For example, if there are 10 people sharing a loan of $2,000, each individual borrower will receive roughly $200 toward their chosen loan use.Kiva has found it to be more effective for our Field Partners to choose 1 borrower from a group to highlight in the loan description and loan use statement, instead of listing information about every member of the group and how they will use their loan. By encouraging partners to highlight 1 borrower and telling that person's story, our hope is also that lenders will feel more of a sense of connection to that borrower (and the loan).

Repayments
What happens if a borrower can’t repay the loan?
If a borrower is behind on paying back a loan, the Field Partner or Kiva (in the case of a direct loan) may try to reschedule repayments on the delinquent loan in order to make it possible for the borrower to eventually repay, which is common practice in microlending. However, even with these efforts to be flexible, at times borrowers simply can't repay and their loans end in default. When a Kiva loan defaults, we notify all contributing lenders by email and these lenders can consider the remaining amount outstanding as a loss. Field Partners may decide not to lend to a specific individual again if they aren't able to repay, depending on their circumstances. In the case of direct loans, borrowers can't apply for another loan on Kiva unless they've repaid previous loans.

Creating & managing a team
How do I become the captain of a lending team?
There are 2 ways to become the captain of a lending team. First, you can create a new lending team, which automatically makes you the captain. Second, you can be made the captain of an existing lending team. To do this, one of the current team captains has to give you captainhood. As the captain of a lending team, it is your responsibility to make a good faith effort to remain involved in your team. This includes approving or declining requests to join your team, reading messages posted to the team message board, and responding to lender messages sent to you by members of your team.
In the event that a team captain fails in these responsibilities, a team member may contact Kiva
and request to be appointed as an additional team captain. In these circumstances, we will reach out to the original team captain. If the captain does not respond within 7 days, the new team captain will be appointed.

Amount of currency exchange loss
The amount of currency exchange loss is the amount of loans not repaid due to currency fluctuations. When lending internationally, the local currency in a Field Partner's country may lose some of its value compared to the US dollar -- requiring the partner to use more of its local currency to reimburse Kiva in USD. We offer Field Partners the option to protect themselves against severe currency fluctuations by sharing losses with Kiva lenders. By bearing these losses, lenders protect the partner and its borrowers from currency devaluations.

Islamic finance
What are "Islamic Finance" or Sharia-compliant Muslim loans?
A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. A few of Kiva's Field Partners who work in predominately Muslim communities have developed a sharia-compliant loan product, adapting the loan terms to fit this cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, these partners do charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fee. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.To help lenders find these loans, they are tagged with the "Islamic Finance" loan attribute, and if a loan is sharia-compliant this will be noted on the loan profile under "Additional information about this loan."To learn more about why Kiva supports Islamic microfinance and how these loans are structurally different than other Kiva loans, I'd encourage you to check out this blog: kiva.org/updates/kiva/2012/05/01/kivas-approach-to-lending-and-islamic.html

Donations to Kiva
Is my Kiva Card purchase tax deductible?
Kiva Cards are intended to be used to make loans on Kiva's website, which are not considered tax deductible donations because there's a possibility that the lender will be repaid. Therefore, Kiva Card purchases are also not considered donations. However, if a Kiva Card you purchase is not redeemed, it will automatically convert into a donation to Kiva 1 year from the purchase date. At that time, as the purchaser, you will receive a receipt confirming the donation (which can be considered a tax deductible donation at that time).

Loan Types
Why might a borrower use their loan for another purpose than what's described in their loan profile?
While the situation of a borrower taking out a loan for one reason and using it for another purpose doesn't happen very often on Kiva, in the microfinance industry it is common for borrowers to use funds they receive for various purposes outside of the primary loan use. Due to lack of available cash flow to help meet changing needs in the life of a borrower, often times they may use some of their loan funds to meet more immediate needs instead of using the loan in its entirety for the primary purpose. This blog post, written by one of our Kiva Fellows, does a great job at better explaining this concept: https://www.kiva.org/blog/loan-use-not-as-simple-as-you-might-think

About the Field Partner
What do “Average Cost to Borrower” and “PY” mean?
Many of Kiva's Field Partners do charge borrowers in some form in order to make possible the long-term sustainability of their operations, reach and impact. While Field Partners may request payment from borrowers, and some Field Partners are profitable, Kiva carefully chooses to partner with organizations that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved, and our due diligence methods include thorough analyses of the costs and benefits of individual loan products. Moreover, partners with a very high cost to borrowers undergo additional annual screening by Kiva to further review their pricing rationale.Currently, there are 4 different types of information about our Field Partners that may appear in this Average Cost to Borrower field: Portfolio Yield (PY), Annual Percentage Rate (APR), Monthly Percentage Rate (MPR) and Not Applicable (N/A). Kiva displays only versions of these rates that are nominal, meaning that the effect of inflation in each country is not taken into account. See The World Factbook for a publicly available list of inflation rates.For this specific Field Partner, Kiva displays Portfolio Yield (PY), which is equal to a Field Partner's financial earnings divided by its average loan portfolio outstanding during a given year. Currently, Kiva displays Portfolio Yield for most of its Field Partners that are microfinance institutions (MFIs). Portfolio Yield applies to the institution as a whole, and thus is a proxy for cost to borrowers rather than a direct measurement. Kiva calculates Portfolio Yield directly from the most recently available financial statements of a Field Partner and compares this result with other publicly available sources of pricing information such as mixmarket.org and mftransparency.org.Although there's a strong correlation between Portfolio Yield and APR, in some circumstances Portfolio Yield underestimates borrower cost, primarily because it does not account for the cost to borrowers of mandatory savings and/or security deposits. For more information on the relationship between Portfolio Yield, APR and cost to borrowers, see this analysis. Although Portfolio Yield remains a valuable metric, Kiva is also exploring ways to simplify and standardize the process to collect, calculate, assess and share APR pricing information for more partners.So why does Kiva choose to show Portfolio Yield for some partners?- It's a better metric than self-reported interest rates because it includes fees and other charges, and is annualized.- It's readily available from an analysis of a Field Partner's financial statements.- It's widely understood and commonly used within the microfinance industry, and many MFIs report this data publicly to Mix Market.- It's much quicker and cheaper to calculate than APR, saving Kiva resources to invest in efforts such as expanding to new countries and supporting new and innovative lending.

Why are there so few education loans fundraising?
Kiva relies on our Field Partners to upload new loan requests on Kiva’s website. Loans for educational purposes tend to be very popular with Kiva lenders, which means that when they're posted they tend to fund very quickly. The great news is that as Kiva grows, one of the areas we're looking to expand our impact in is education, which means that we're continually looking for new partners in this space.

Loan matching
What would cause my loan not to be matched?
Due to the popularity of loan matching, our sponsors' funds are often used up very quickly. Therefore we cannot 100% guarantee your loan will be matched. If a loan has a "x2" icon on it, it means matching funds will match your contribution made to the loan, as long as sponsors' funds are still available. When a loan is almost fully funded, there may not be enough of the loan left for a matcher to match your contribution. For example, if you fund the last $25 of a loan, there would be no loan balance remaining for the matcher's fund to support, so in that case your loan may not be matched.

In the meantime, if you'd like to support microloans in India, you may want to check out Milaap.org, which is a crowdfunding microloan website based in India, and also a Kiva Field Partner.

How lending works
How does a group loan work?
Group loans are a powerful innovation in microfinance because they are often less expensive for partners to manage in terms of time and resources. Organizations can leverage the local knowledge of individuals to select good borrowers, disburse many loans at once, and collect repayments more easily.In a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan, usually an equal portion of the amount stated on the loan page. The group is there to provide support to its members and also provides a system of peer pressure in repayment of their loans. They may or may not be formally bound by a group guarantee, which requires other members to cover the loans of their fellow group member if someone has difficulty repaying.

You see if the loan is at risk of currency loss by visiting the loan page. This information is noted on the right side of the page next to the label "Currency Exchange Loss." The Field Partner-specified currency exchange loss to lenders can be one of three values: Covered, Possible, or N/A.Covered: The Field Partner has opted to cover any losses on the loan that are due to currency fluctuation. Lenders will not bear losses due to currency fluctuation. Possible: The Field Partner has opted not to cover losses on the loan that are due to currency fluctuation. In this situation, lenders face additional risk because they will bear losses greater than 10%. N/A: The Field Partner disburses loans to borrowers in USD so their loans are not subject to any foreign currency conversion.

Kiva has found it to be more effective and efficient for our Field Partners to choose 1 borrower from a group to highlight in the loan description, instead of having them list information about every member of the group and how they will use their loan. By telling 1 person's story, our hope is that lenders will feel more of a sense of connection to that borrower (and the loan) than they would if the description were only a list of group names and loan uses. Therefore, it is our policy to ask our partners to choose a member of the group, typically a person who acts as a group leader or has a particularly compelling story to share, and write up more detailed information about that person in the loan description.

Social underwriting & risk
What are the risks involved with lending to direct loans?
Lending money to U.S. loans is inherently riskier than lending to partner-facilitated loans, as there is less on-the-ground oversight and penalties for non-repayment. U.S. loans go through a different risk evaluation process and don't receive a formal risk rating. These loans are approved through our due diligence and social underwriting processes, which allow borrowers to prove their creditworthiness by having a Trustee vouch for them, or by recruiting their networks to lend to them before being posted publicly on Kiva. There are many reasons why a loan might not be paid back, ranging from poor market conditions for the business to the borrower experiencing a catastrophic accident, or simply falling out of touch despite our efforts to contact them. As a newer type of lending, there are more unknown variables in direct lending that we continue to discover as we support more borrowers and perfect our risk management strategy.Although U.S. loans carry greater risks, we're also careful to ensure they are having a high impact, providing opportunities to borrowers who are excluded from traditional funding sources or who are offering a social benefit to their community.

Kiva's Response to COVID-19
What are Crisis Support Loans?
Crisis Support Loans provide loans directly to our Field Partners and small-to-medium social enterprises, to cover their operating needs during this challenging period. Some of these needs include paying salaries and retaining staff jobs in order to lend and operate their business as usual. They also enable investments in upgrading communication technology to be able to work remotely and continue to serve borrowers. Through these loans, Field Partners and social enterprises will be able to create, market, and finance new emergency loan types specifically designed for borrowers affected by this crisis.  These loans are an important way for Kiva to immediately help organizations who are working to disburse loans to borrowers in the context of COVID-19.Some loans in this category will be used to support existing Labs Social Enterprise (LSE) borrowers, who need additional financing to cover their costs.

Impact
Does Kiva measure its Field Partners' environmental impact?
When Kiva selects new Field Partners to work with, we certainly try to look at the holistic vision of the institution, and how it measures the progress / impact / growth of its clients in both financial and non-financial terms. The amount of information available to institutions on these issues varies widely, as do the ways that they monitor and evaluate their process. For this reason, at this time, Kiva does not have anything formal in place to evaluate our partners in regards to animal rights and environmental sustainability issues.
One way that we try to maximize the good created through Kiva is by partnering with organizations that go above and beyond to generate positive outcomes for the communities they serve.This is called social performance and you can read more about the social performance strengths of our partners on our website here: kiva.org/about/socialperformanceIn addition, Kiva has focused our efforts to expand the number of green loans fundraising on our website, by specifically seeking out partner organizations focused on clean energy solutions, sustainable agriculture and the recycling and repurposing of materials. We've also been working on creating incentives to encourage our current Field Partners to post more green loans.
As Kiva grows and we have tools in place to better measure impact, one thing we may be able to do in the future is rate businesses on our site by how "friendly" they are to the environment, to the health and safety of their communities, and to the well being of their workers (if they employ others). We look forward to exploring opportunities like this in the future.

Updates & Repayments
Why do some borrowers make early repayments on their loans?
A culture of early repayment is common in many countries where we work. Field Partners tell us that often times borrowers will repay loans early if they have the financial means to do so. This has both social implications (i.e. pride, respect, reputation, etc.) as well as practical financial reasons for the borrower. Some partners operate on a "declining balance" payment system, which means that by paying more money early on, the borrower is charged less in total interest payments. Also, many of these partners don't charge early repayment penalties, which means there isn't a charge to the borrower should they decide to repay ahead of schedule.

Currency exchange loss
Can I make money if the value of the local currency appreciates relative to the US dollar?
Kiva loans are not securities or investment vehicles and therefore can't be used to make money via currency exchange fluctuations. While lenders will not gain funds beyond their prinicipal loan amount if the local currency appreciates against the US dollar, gains will be credited back to lenders to offset losses on the same loan, if losses were previously experienced. If no losses were experienced, currency gains will go into a general loan fund managed by Kiva to be used for engagement campaigns.

Borrower Selection
Why aren't borrowers smiling in photos?
We know that many lenders prefer to support borrowers that are smiling in their photo, as it's a common practice to smile when you're in front of a camera in many Western countries.
However, this is not true for all cultures and regions of the world. In fact, in some cultures it's inappropriate to smile in pictures, as it might imply that someone is foolish or doesn't take their loan or business seriously. Or, it could be that someone isn't accustomed to smiling in photos, so it didn't occur to them to smile for the loan officer when taking a photo for their Kiva loan.
Whatever the reason, we want to respect the cultures where borrowers live and work, allowing them the choice to smile or not. To read a bit more about this, check out this blog post written by one of our Kiva Fellows: https://www.kiva.org/blog/dona-elsa-meets-her-smile

Loan disbursal
What is the disbursed date?
The disbursed date indicates the date that the borrower receives their loan funds.
Loan disbursal for loans on Kiva can happen anywhere from 30 days before to 90 days after the loan is posted on the Kiva website. Direct loans are always post-disbursed, and will be done only after the loan has fully fundraised on Kiva. In the case of partner loans, many of our Field Partners choose to disburse loan funds before the loan request is posted on Kiva. We allow pre-disbursal because it ensures that the funds reach the borrower as soon as they are needed. Loan funds from Kiva lenders then go to backfill that amount and as a lender you assume the risk of the loan. By doing this, our Field Partners assume the risk that, if the loan isn't funded by lenders, they will have to fund the loan without any funds from Kiva. If a partner loan is not pre-disbursed, it will be listed on Kiva with an expected "post-disbursed" date. If a post-disbursed loan is not funded on Kiva, there is a chance that the borrower may not receive their loan. Some Field Partners choose to disburse loans with other sources of funding, while other partners don't have the resources available to fund loans without Kiva lenders' support. No direct loans will be disbursed unless they fully fundraise on Kiva.

Borrowers are allowed to take out concurrent loans.

Risk & due diligence
What is an Experimental Field Partner?
If a Field Partner is labeled as Experimental, this means that Kiva has required only a comparatively light level of due diligence and monitoring, in exchange for only allowing this Field Partner access to a small amount of funding through Kiva at any given time. The Experimental Field Partner program was created to facilitate access to Kiva for small social enterprises and innovative pilot credit programs. Frequently, Kiva will conduct further due diligence on these Field Partners after an initial testing period, potentially graduating the Field Partner out of Experimental status. Since Kiva does not conduct a full risk analysis of Experimental Field Partners, they are not assigned a formal risk rating on our website. Lenders should always assume that these partners represent the highest level of repayment risk on Kiva.

If a Kiva U.S. loan does not reach its fundraising goal in time, all lenders to that loan are refunded their contribution, and the borrower does not receive any portion of the loan. Unfortunately, Kiva doesn't yet disburse partial loans or make up the difference of the amount that they didn't fundraise in the U.S.However, borrowers are welcome to apply for a second time if they reached at least 50% of their goal. If your loan expires, you can begin and submit a new application at kiva.org/borrower
If you do choose to reapply, we encourage you to consider requesting a lower loan amount, while also, working to improve the quality of your profile by following these guidelines: https://www.kivaushub.org/application

How will Kiva decide which loans my Monthly Good supports?
Monthly Good contributions are lent automatically to borrowers who need help reaching their 100% funded goal. This could be anyone on Kiva: from a farmer to a student, an artisan to a shop keeper.
This automatic lending is based on who real people are supporting on Kiva at any given moment. So when another lender supports a particular borrower, we can match that support with an automatic loan from your Monthly Good. The wisdom of the Kiva lending crowd will direct your automatic loan.

Currency exchange loss
What does it mean for a partner to cover currency loss?
When a Field Partner covers currency losses, they agree to cover any losses on loans due to currency fluctuations, even those in excess of 10%.This would happen in the case where the US dollar appreciates significantly relative to a local currency. When the borrower pays back the full loan amount in a local currency, that amount converted to US dollars would be less than the original amount lent by Kiva lenders. The Field Partner would then cover the loss, so that lenders would be repaid the full amount they originally lent.

Currency exchange loss
How does Kiva calculate currency exchange rates?
All currency conversion rates come from XE, which calculates its rates using live, up-to-the-minute mid-market currency rates. For more information please visit: xe.com The starting amount is calculated on the date that the loan is posted to the Kiva system by the Field Partner, and we’ll use the currency rates on the billing date every month to calculate whether there has been any currency exchange loss on the repayment.

Field Partner's default rate
The default rate is the percentage of ended loans (no longer paying back) which have failed to
repay (measured in dollar volume, not units). How this is calculated: default rate = amount of ended loans defaulted / amount of ended loansNotes: - Many Field Partners do not yet have many ended loans due to their
short history on Kiva (see "Time on Kiva"). If this is the case, a more meaningful indicator
of principal risk is "delinquency rate."- At Kiva, we define default (non-repayment) as: the time when Kiva determines that collection of funds from a borrower or partner is doubtful, or the cumulative amount repaid as of a quarterly reconciliation is less than the amount expected as of 180 days prior and there have been no repayments reported to Kiva during this time. . Kiva typically processes defaults on a quarterly basis, and case by case exceptions may be made if the partner or Kiva anticipates future repayments to be made on the loan. Field Partners also have the option to default loans at any time, should they determine that further collection of loan repayments from the borrower is unlikely.

Repayments
Why did repayments show up in my account the month prior to when they were due?
Kiva works on a net billing system with our Field Partners, which means that for any given month we subtract the amount of repayments that a Field Partner owes to Kiva lenders from the amount that the partner fundraises for borrowers on Kiva. Any money that the partner has raised during the month is first used to cover what is owed to Kiva lenders. Field Partners then have until the 1st of the following month to send Kiva any additional amount outstanding. This process of returning funds to Kiva lenders is called "settlement" and has historically started to run on the 17th of the month prior to when repayments are due to lenders. For example, settlement for repayments due to lenders by February 1, 2016 would start to occur on January 17, 2016. Depending on how much the partner had raised on Kiva, repayments owed to lenders may begin posting to lender accounts on the 17th of January (when settlement began) and would continue to post Kiva received additional funds from the partner, up until the 1st of February (when the actual repayments were due). Because of this process, a month's repayment will usually show up in your account the second half of the month prior on partner loans.

Currency exchange loss
Why do some Field Partners decide not to pass on currency loss to Kiva lenders?
Kiva allows its Field Partners to choose whether to pass catastrophic currency losses on to Kiva lenders. In these cases, if the value of the US dollar appreciates more than 10% against the local currency, repayments made on Kiva loans will be marked with a currency loss.
However, some Field Partners opt to cover all losses on the loan that are due to currency fluctuation. For instance, some Field Partners disburse loans to borrowers in US dollars, thereby posing no currency risk as the loan will never have to be converted into a local currency that might fluctuate against the USD. Other Field Partners simply do not see foreign exchange rates posing a significant risk, as they operate in countries where the local currency exchange rate has fluctuated very little over the past several years.
Meanwhile, some Field Partners may simply want to eliminate risk for its lenders, thereby hoping to increase the amount of loans made to the borrowers they support. These are just a few of a variety of reasons why Field Partners may decide to opt out of sharing currency risk.

Withdrawals
Kiva Withdrawal Policy
All funds added into Kiva accounts must first be used to make microloans on Kiva's website before being withdrawn. Once funds have been loaned out and repaid, the owner of the funds may choose to withdraw that money into a PayPal account. Kiva is a charitable financial intermediary involved in philanthropic and social microlending, and is subject to the authority of the California attorney general and the Internal Revenue Service. By virtue of its status as an American organization, Kiva is required to abide by anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism funding prevention regulations applicable to all U.S. persons. In order to ensure that Kiva is in compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism funding prevention regulations applicable to all U.S. persons, Kiva monitors all lender withdrawals before sending funds to PayPal to monitor for unusual behavior. If we notice unusual behavior, we reserve the right to reach out to the requestor of a withdrawal to confirm that they understand Kiva's withdrawal policy and are in full compliance with such guidelines.

Updates & Repayments
I received an update indicating a loan has been fully repaid, but that isn't reflected in my account. Why is that?
Because Kiva works on a net billing system, there's a delay between when the borrower pays back their loan in full and when those funds are settled back into lenders' accounts. This mean that if a Field Partner writes an update at the time in which the borrower repays their loan in full, it may be sent to lenders prior to the point in which those funds are actually returned to lenders. However, during the next billing cycle, the Field Partner should send any repayments collected on the loan, at which time Kiva will credit your account with the repayments due to you and mark the loan as fully repaid.To learn more about how Kiva's repayment system works, check out this answer in our Help Center: kiva.org/help/solution/how_does_kivas_repayment_system_work

Thanks to the generosity of Kiva's sponsors some loans are being matched on Kiva's website. Due to the popularity of matching, our sponsors' funds are often used very quickly. Therefore we cannot 100% guarantee your loan will be matched. If a loan has a "x2" icon on it, it means that matching funds will match your contribution made to the loan, so long as sponsors' funds are still available.

Loan disbursal
Why is the disbursal date in the past?
Loans can be disbursed to the borrower anywhere between 30 days before it's posted to Kiva to 90 days after being posted. Most partner loans are pre-disbursed, which we allow because it ensures the funds reach the borrower as soon as they are needed. Contributions from Kiva lenders then back-fill that amount, and lenders assume the risk of that loan. If the loan is not fully funded then the Field Partner may fund the loan from their own capital reserves.While allowing pre-disbursal may seem to disconnect lenders and borrowers, this isn't true. As a lender, your repayments are tied to the repayments of the loan you choose to fund. By assuming the risk of a loan, you allow Kiva's Field Partners to offer loan products to borrowers at a lower cost than traditional financial institutions.

How do abandoned property laws impact Kiva?
Organizations like Kiva are required by many state governments to turn over unclaimed property to the state for safekeeping after several years. If your account becomes inactive, Kiva will need instructions for what to do with any funds left in your account.  Kiva accounts are considered inactive for purposes of unclaimed property laws if they have no activity for 24 consecutive months.  “Activity” includes things like logins, loan purchases (even via auto-lending), repayments, and withdrawals.If you haven’t selected an option in your account settings for inactivity, or if you have asked us to return your remaining credit to you but you haven’t provided a valid PayPal account for withdrawals, Kiva may be required to send your funds to your home state for safekeeping (or to the state of California if we do not know your location).

Direct lending basics
Why does Kiva lend funds to borrowers in the United States?
At Kiva, we believe that access to safe, affordable capital can help enable people work towards their dreams and create better lives for themselves and their communities. This is true for people all around the world. While an entrepreneur in the United States may appear to have access to many financial resources and options, this isn't always true. Many people in the U.S. today are still excluded from traditional funding sources like banks, and are unable to access the capital they need to grow or start their business. And the need for new solutions is great: there are 46.7 million people living in poverty in the U.S. and income inequality has been growing for decades (see: cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality)
Kiva has facilitated loans to borrowers in the U.S. since 2009, and in 2016 our direct lending program became our main strategy for impact in the U.S. We pride ourselves on working with people from all different backgrounds, from the formerly incarcerated to veterans, immigrants and sustainable food producers. Our hope is that by providing these entrepreneurs with access to affordable capital, they'll be able to grow their businesses and their credit history, so they can access more traditional loans in the future.
That said, we know and respect that lenders have different preferences for how they want to use their money on Kiva. We encourage all lenders to direct their funds toward loans that align with where they want to make an impact, locally or abroad.

What can fundraise
Why are some loan amounts so high?
In most emerging markets, the average microfinance loan is under $1,000, so larger loans are not necessarily considered microloans. In development terms, $50-100k is on the small end of small and medium enterprise loans. At Kiva we don't think of ourselves as only about microlending, but more focused on the broader goal of creating financial inclusion. Microloans will continue to constitute the vast majority of the loans on Kiva, but we also believe that addressing an issue as large and complex as poverty is best tackled from a variety of different angles. And today, one of the biggest unmet needs to spur economic development in less-developed countries is the Missing Middle (small enterprises that create jobs and provide large-scale solutions for poverty). We believe that by supporting both types of loans, we can all play a significant role in building the foundations for thriving communities both today and long into the future.

More information about successive and concurrent loans
Field Partners often work with borrowers over time to help them build credit and expand their businesses. In order to make it easier for partners to post loans for borrowers who have been listed on Kiva before, we allow some partners the ability to relist a loan without having to re-enter all of the borrower's information. When this occurs, you'll see an updated loan description, as well as excerpts of the original descriptions from an earlier loan. Most borrowers take out loans consecutively, meaning that they receive a second loan after having repaid the first. However, sometimes our Field Partners give out concurrent loans, allowing borrowers to take out one primary loan and a secondary "add-on" loan along with it. These additional loans are typically smaller than the borrower's primary loan and serve a different purpose. We trust our partners to determine whether a borrower has the means to be able to repay a successive or concurrent loan.

borrower in his/her picture or not indicating their name and/or location.Because Kiva works in areas of the world where there are political and social challenges, Kiva allows our Field Partners the
option to anonymize borrower profiles as they see fit. Rest assured, as with all borrowers on Kiva, those with blurred photos have been vetted by Kiva's Field Partners and their names screened against U.S. Treasury and Homeland
Security anti-terrorism lists.

Does Kiva work with for-profit or nonprofit Field Partners?
Kiva is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, but we work with both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In
many cases, banking regulations in the countries where our Field Partners
operate determine whether the organization needs to be a nonprofit or
for-profit company. At Kiva we are committed to working with Field Partners with a strong social mission and those that offer relevant and useful services to their borrowers, regardless of the organization's
profit status. We do extensive due diligence and have conducted social
performance audits on all of our Field Partners. We also require
all Field Partners to endorse the SMART Campaign for Client Protection
(smartcampaign.org/about/campaign-mission-a-goals),
which includes transparent and reasonable pricing as one of their
client protection principles. By working with both for-profit and nonprofit organizations we are able
to expand the reach of our loan portfolio. For example, some of our
nonprofit Field Partners serve areas or populations that for-profit
organizations don't reach, whereas our for-profit Field Partners may
offer savings services to borrowers, something nonprofit organizations
cannot do. All of our Field Partners, regardless of their profit status, are committed to doing good in the areas in which they work.

Loans at risk rate
The loans at risk rate refers to the percentage of Kiva loans being paid back by this Field Partner that are past due in repayment by at least 1 day (also known as arrears). This delinquency can be due to either non-payment by Kiva borrowers or non-payment by the Field Partner itself. Loans at risk rate = outstanding $ value of delinquent paying back loans / outstanding $ value of all paying back loansExample: A partner has fives loans that are in “paying back” status and the loan amount for each is $100. All of the loans have first installments of $10. One borrower repays only $9 and hence, his loan is in arrears. The other four borrowers repay $10. The loans at risk rate is 91 / 451 = 20.18%. The loans at risk rate is an aggregate that does not distinguish between borrower delinquency and partner delinquency. So in the example above, the loans at risk rate will be 20.18% regardless of whether it is the borrower or partner that is behind in repayments.

How lending works
What does "XX Days Left" mean on a loan?
All loan requests can fundraise for up to 30 days on the Kiva website. In the last 5 days of a loan's fundraising period, if the loan hasn't yet reached its full amount, we add a box to the loan profile which displays the number of days or hours left to fundraise. Our hope is that this will make it easier for lenders to know what loans are getting close to the end of this funding period.If a loan request is not fully funded within this period, any funds that lenders contributed to that loan request will be returned to their Kiva accounts as Kiva credit.

Social underwriting & risk
What is social underwriting?
Rather than determining a borrower's financial eligibility based on traditional financial factors like credit scores, cash flow or collateral, social underwriting allows a borrower's community to vouch for their creditworthiness. Kiva U.S. uses social underwriting to lend to socially impactful borrowers based on their character.Social underwriting is implemented in multiple ways. Borrowers can be endorsed by a Trustee who writes an endorsement and can help the borrower in fundraising and provide business advice. All Kiva U.S. borrowers also go through a private fundraising period where they must have a certain number of their personal network make a loan to them before they are posted to the greater Kiva community. Finally, every loan must be funded by Kiva's lender community, and every lender has the chance to independently decide if they want to support the loan.

Why isn't PayPal accepting my lender's credit card?
PayPal provides Kiva with free payment processing on all financial transactions, which means that regardless of whether a lender pays using a credit card or PayPal account, PayPal will process their payment and send them a receipt. Because of this, if your lenders run into trouble using a credit card to make a payment on Kiva, we unfortunately can't do anything directly to figure out why your payment isn't going through.To help troubleshoot the issue, you may advise them to use a different browser, use a private browser or go into "incognito mode", to clear their current browser's cache and cookies, or use a different credit card.If they continue having trouble using their credit card, they can give PayPal's customer service team a call at 888-445-5032 (Toll Free US) or 402-952-8811 (International).

Can partners cover borrower default?
In the case of borrower default, we do not allow our Field Partners to cover what is owed to the lenders. When Kiva started we originally allowed Field Partners the option to cover borrower defaults. However, after receiving much feedback from our lender community about the desire for a stronger connection between lenders and borrowers, Kiva changed its process around default protection to no longer allow our Field Partners to cover borrower defaults.

Why does Kiva allow Field Partners to post larger loans?
In keeping with Kiva’s mission to expand financial access to help communities thrive, we're committed to making sure that lenders’ capital is being used to address poverty in the most effective and impactful ways. Most of the time, that’s through catalytic microloans that enable borrowers to make transformative changes in their lives and the lives of their families.In addition to these microloans, we see that ideas for addressing poverty can happen on a bigger, community-sized scale. Kiva strongly believes that the largest development gains are enjoyed not only when there’s a thriving microenterprise sector, but when we also see a healthy number of small enterprises that can create jobs for other members of their community. To learn more, please check out this blog: blog.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/12/27/bridging-the-missing-middle-the-impact-of-larger-loans-on-kiva

Interest rates
Why are interest rates in post-conflict areas so high?
Self-sustainability is critical to creating long-term solutions to poverty, and charging interest to borrowers enables our Field Partners to bear costs and achieve self-sustainability. Due to the high cost of reaching borrowers, and relatively low profit gained from each small loan, microfinance institutions generally have to charge higher interest rates than traditional banks, which is why these rates are so much higher than what we are accustomed to in the developed world. In addition, the cost of delivering microfinance services in post-conflict environments, such as the DRC or South Sudan, is still higher, which necessitates an even higher interest rate. In a post-conflict environment, communications and transportation infrastructure is often severely compromised, making it more expensive to contact and visit borrowers and manage a microfinance institution (MFI). Furthermore, the risk of default is higher in post-conflict environments. This is true due in part to continued instability, which can make it difficult for borrowers to operate successful businesses, as well as a culture of aid. A person who is accustomed to receiving donated goods is often less-likely to repay a loan. To manage this enhanced risk of default, MFIs in post-conflict areas must put aside a larger portion of their available capital as a provision against loan losses, a costly but necessary means of ensuring that they have sufficient funds to continue to operate when faced with defaults. Due in part to these realities on the ground, and in part to funders' reticence in investing in unstable countries, the cost of funds is higher for MFIs in post-conflict areas. This is one of the reasons Kiva works in post-conflict areas, and also supports MFIs with high interest rates in countries such as the DRC or South Sudan. Because our Field Partners don’t have to pay interest to Kiva for the loans that they administer, Kiva loans help these Field Partners reach communities and populations that may not otherwise be served. It is also important to note that Kiva partners only with microfinance institutions that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked, and underserved. All that being said, we understand that some lenders may not wish to fund particular loans on the Kiva website, or loans over a certain cost to borrowers. Therefore, if you are not comfortable lending to borrowers in these regions of the world, given either the riskiness of the operating environment or the cost to borrowers, we encourage you to exercise your consumer choice and select loans that are in line with your own values and preferences.

How does sharing the risk of currency losses help the borrower I’ve supported?
It may appear that borrowers are not directly affected by foreign exchange risk sharing, as they both receive and pay back loans in their local currency. However, foreign exchange risk sharing offers protection for Field Partners in these borrowers' local areas. This ensures that borrowers can continue to apply for and receive loans from their local Field Partners. This also enables Field Partners to serve more borrowers in their local communities.

Inactive Field Partner
An inactive partner is not currently posting new loans, but is in good standing with Kiva (Kiva fully expects the partner to continue to send repayments owed to Kiva lenders for as long as the partner has an outstanding balance). A partner may be in inactive status for a variety of reasons, such as operational constraints preventing them from posting loans. Kiva monitors inactive partners according to their outstanding balance, with a higher level of monitoring conducted on partners with higher balances.

Why do some Field Partners post group loans?
Group loans are a powerful innovation in microfinance because they are often less expensive for partners to manage in terms of time and resources. Organizations can leverage the local knowledge of individuals to select good borrowers, disburse many loans at once, collect repayments in a group and more easily follow up on delinquent loans, as group members have an incentive to work with each other to ensure on-time repayment.

Impact
How does Kiva aim to reach people not being served by traditional banks?
At Kiva, we aim to do more than simply provide a platform for microfinance services to thrive. We're also trying to reach people who, for whatever reason, are not often within the scope of traditional microfinance institutions or banks. We envision a world where every individual has the power to create opportunity for themselves and others and as we work toward this reality, we are constantly challenging ourselves to find new ways for our lenders’ flexible, risk-tolerant capital to grow markets and reach even more people with innovative loan products. This is core to Kiva’s quest for deeper impact – one that is shared by our generous lender community.
So when it comes to reaching even more borrowers with the right loans and services, we look to enable change at the partner level in 2 different ways:
First and foremost, we want to support good institutions, with strong social missions, so that they can grow their core offerings and serve even more people. These partners work to achieve what we call breadth of impact. Our social performance scoring process helps ensure that we pick good organizations to work with, and that we give them credit for the work they do.
On the depth side, we look to help our Field Partners reach into new areas, innovating and expanding their loan offerings in what we call the four Ps: populations, products, places and prices. Here’s what we hope to achieve:
Populations - Enabling partners to use Kiva funding to help expand to new populations, especially those that are marginalized or excluded from financial services.
Products - Enabling partners to use Kiva funding to offer new products that promote or enable social causes, like loans for solar lighting devices, or to pay college tuitions.
Places - Enabling partners to use Kiva funding to expand to new geographic locations, especially areas where there are few options for accessing loans.
Prices - Enabling partners to use Kiva funding to drive down the cost of loans for clients.
With this support, we’re seeing more and more partners develop new types of loans that take this into account -- loans that provide the right products and services to the people who need them most. We consider these loans to have a higher potential for impact. As we grow, we will continue to work hard to increase both our breath and depth of impact -- all in the spirit of serving more borrowers, better.

What is social underwriting and why is it a requirement to get a Kiva U.S. loan?
At Kiva, we envision a world where someone’s creditworthiness is determined by the strength of their character rather than their credit history. We’re working to re-insert human relationships into the financial system by using social underwriting to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers.To demonstrate social capital, we require all gather support from their community through the Private Fundraising Period.  During this 15 day period, we require that all borrowers recruit a certain number of lenders from their network to make a loan to them before the loan is publicly posted on Kiva. Kiva views this as an important measure of the borrower’s trust network and hopes these lenders hold the borrower accountable to repaying their loan.While the Private Fundraising Period is a tool we use to access a borrower’s creditworthiness, we’ve also found that it increases a borrower’s chance of success on Kiva, as loans fundraise much more quickly when the borrower’s immediate network is engaged during fundraising.Depending on the size of the loan and multiple factors, borrowers must invite between 5 and 35 lenders from within their network.

Interest rates
Why do your Field Partners in Mexico have such a high cost to borrowers?
There are many reasons why our Mexican Field Partners have a higher than average cost to borrowers compared to other areas where Kiva works. Because Mexico is not the poorest country in the world and there is a large middle/upper class, the costs of doing business in Mexico are much much higher than places in Africa, or Bolivia, as an example. This means that salaries are higher because cost of living is higher, rent for offices is higher, transportation costs are higher, etc. Because of all of these factors, operational costs of an institution in Mexico are higher than other places in the world, therefore interest rates are higher. Mexico is also a very large country as compared to many other countries we work in. Our Mexican partners work all across the country from the border with Texas to the border with Guatemala, and from one coast to the other. Since you can’t drive from one side of the country to the other, our Field Partners have to have offices in each region, and those offices need to be supervised by headquarters. Since it's not easy for management to drive between offices, they must take overnight buses, or sometimes fly. This is a pretty particular issue to Mexico and the partners we work with in this region. Lastly, loan sizes in Mexico are quite small, especially as in relation to the “wealth” of the country. The loan sizes are around $400 and that’s about 3% of GNI per capita. This really tells you that they are serving more downmarket in a country where there are higher incomes and therefore higher costs, so they are really reaching down market. Many other partners are doing loan sizes that are more than 20% GNI per capita. Reaching populations at 3% of GNI per capita implies much higher costs. All that being said, we understand that some lenders may not wish to fund particular loans on the Kiva website, or loans over a certain cost to borrowers. If you're aren't comfortable lending to a borrower with a portfolio yield this high, we encourage you to exercise choice and select loans that are in line with your own values and preferences.

Currently, Kiva displays portfolio yield for most of its Field Partners that are microfinance institutions (MFIs). Portfolio yield applies to the institution as a whole, and thus is a proxy for cost to borrowers rather than a direct measurement. Kiva calculates portfolio yield directly from the most recently available financial statements of a Field Partner and compares this result with other publicly available sources of pricing information such as mixmarket.org and mftransparency.org.For more information, please visit: What do “Average cost to borrower” and “PY” mean?

What do “Average Cost to Borrower” and “APR” mean?
Many of Kiva's Field Partners do charge borrowers in some form in order to make possible the long-term sustainability of their operations, reach and impact. While Field Partners may request payment from borrowers, and some Field Partners are profitable, Kiva carefully chooses to partner with organizations that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved, and our due diligence methods include thorough analyses of the costs and benefits of individual loan products. Moreover, partners with a very high cost to borrowers undergo additional annual screening by Kiva to further review their pricing rationale.Currently, there are 4 different types of information about our Field Partners that may appear in this Average Cost to Borrower field: Portfolio Yield (PY), Annual Percentage Rate (APR), Monthly Percentage Rate (MPR) and Not Applicable (N/A). Kiva displays only versions of these rates that are nominal, meaning that the effect of inflation in each country is not taken into account. See The World Factbook for a publicly available list of inflation rates.For this specific Field Partner, Kiva displays an Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which represents the estimated average cost paid by a borrower to this Field Partner to access a loan posted on Kiva, with that cost annualized and converted into a percentage rate. Currently, Kiva displays APR for most of its Field Partners that aren't microfinance institutions (MFIs), in addition to some that are. Kiva is exploring ways to simplify and standardize the process to collect, calculate, assess and share APR pricing information for more partners. Using tools provided by MicroFinance Transparency, Kiva calculates this APR based on a detailed analysis of the types of loans this Field Partner has posted and/or plans to post on Kiva.Showing an APR value does not always imply that the Field Partner charges interest on its loans. Kiva works with Field Partners across many sectors, including some that don't provide cash loans to borrowers. Instead, these partners provide impactful products or services, which the borrower pays for over time. Thus, the total costs paid by a borrower to a Field Partner may (or may not) include interest charges, fees, security deposits, rent or other delayed payments for the delivery of goods or services.

Currency exchange loss
How will borrowers and Field Partners be affected by currency exchange risk sharing?
Sharing the burden of currency-related losses between Field Partners and lenders can help reduce a partner's risk of defaults arising from catastrophic local currency devaluations.
It may appear that borrowers are not directly affected by foreign exchange risk sharing, as they both receive and pay back loans in their local currency. However, currency exchange risk sharing offers protection for Field Partners in these borrowers' local areas.

What guidelines are there for fundraising?
While fundraising on Kiva, borrowers should expect to recruit some lenders from within their own network. However, borrowers may not:Engage in self-promotion, advertising or solicitation. FOR EXAMPLE: Do not promote your loan in private lender messages or in lending teams (unless you have permission from the team captain).Fund any portion of their own loan.In the event of either of these instances, the share purchase will be refunded, and further, more severe actions might also be taken, depending on the circumstances.

Amount of currency exchange gain
When lending internationally, the local currency in a Field Partner's country may gain value compared to the US dollar. In this situation, a Kiva loan may result in a currency exchange gain. If there are currency exchange gains during the course of a loan, such gains will first be used to offset any currency exchange losses on that same loan, and any gains above the original loan amount will be used by Kiva to further its charitable purposes.

Field Partner basics
Why does Kiva have Field Partners?
Kiva's Field Partners are critical to our ability to provide loans efficiently and effectively. By partnering with microfinance institutions, social businesses, schools and non-profit organizations in the field, Kiva leverages their critical knowledge of the local populations and years of experience managing loans.
Were we to operate as a microfinance institution, we would enter the market decades behind many well-equipped organizations with documented success. Partnering allows us to divide and conquer -- Kiva collects loan funds through our website and Field Partners manage the loans on the ground -- allowing maximum efficiency at the lowest cost.

About Kiva
Are Kiva loans securities?

How lending works
How are loans facilitated?
Kiva loans are facilitated through 2 models, partner and direct, that enable us to reach the greatest number of people around the world.For partner loans, borrowers apply to a local Field Partner, which manages the loan on the ground. Field Partners are responsible for screening borrowers, disbursing loans, posting borrowers to the Kiva website for funding, collecting repayments and otherwise administering Kiva loans on the ground to borrowers.For direct loans, borrowers apply through the Kiva website and may or may not be endorsed by a Trustee. Unlike Field Partners, Trustees don't handle any financial transactions or have any duty to repay loans on behalf of their borrowers. Instead, Trustees take the role of providing support and business advice to their borrowers throughout the term of the loan.

Interest rates
Can I pay extra fees on a loan so that the borrower is not charged interest?
We do not have a way for lenders to cover the interest on a loan so that borrowers don't have to pay it.
Sustainably reaching financially excluded borrowers often requires substantial resources, and charging fair rates of interest to these borrowers helps our Field Partners to achieve greater outreach, sustainability, and impact. If Kiva were to allow our lenders to cover the "interest" or costs of facilitating loans, we could be compromising the organization's efforts toward sustainability. If, for some reason Kiva had to pull out of funding a particular Field Partner, and that Field Partner relied on Kiva funding to cover their costs, they would be left without the means to support their organization.
Additionally, Kiva typically does not fund more than 30% of any microfinance institution's total loan portfolio. This means that not every borrower who receives a loan through a Field Partner can receive a loan funded by Kiva lenders. If Kiva loans were interest free, and non-Kiva loans weren't, this could potentially cause problems in the communities in which our Field Partners operate-- creating situations where 2 different women in a community might take out the same loan, but one would receive it interest free and the other would have to pay interest.
While many Field Partners charge interest to borrowers, Kiva will not partner with an organization that charges exorbitant interest rates, and we require our partners to fully disclose their interest rates. We also only partner with organizations that have a strong social commitment to serve the needs of poor, vulnerable and/or excluded populations.

What is mandatory savings?
Some microfinance institutions (MFIs) require borrowers to make a mandatory deposit into a savings account prior to disbursing a loan. The mandatory savings is the property of the borrower and returned to him or her when the loan is repaid, unless the borrower takes out a subsequent loan. If the borrower defaults on loan payments, the mandatory deposit may be used as loan collateral by the MFI. Although mandatory deposits don't always generate interest compensation to borrowers, the frequent lack of access to reliable savings options in developing countries means that making such deposits may be viewed positively by borrowers.

In the latter case, Kiva will attempt to refund lenders with any funds recovered. Direct loans are typically only refunded if the borrower requests it (typically because they've found alternative sources of funding) or if the borrower breaches one of Kiva's policies (e.g. self-fundraising, violating our community guidelines, found evidence of inaccuracies in the information provided to Kiva).  In all cases, information about why the refund was issued should be in the refund email sent to all contributing lenders.

Islamic finance
How is microfinance in the Muslim world different than microfinance in other parts of the world?
Because the prohibition of interest is a key tenet of Islam, some of Kiva's Field Partners lending in the Muslim world have created loan products with a 0% interest rate associated. These loans are designed solely for Muslim borrowers. In order to cover the costs of administering these loans, the Field Partner does charge a fee to the borrower. The fees are subtracted in their entirety from the gross amount of the loan at the time of disbursal and the amount of fees charged vary from one microfinance institution to another.In some countries, Kiva's Field Partners need to make these adaptations so they may claim a fatwa in order to be allowed to operate in the area. A fatwa is a legal pronouncement made by an Islamic scholar or religious leader, and it is important for a microfinance institution to receive a fatwa that officially condones their work. There are also many organizations operating in the Muslim world that don't make these adaptations to their methodology. The decision to charge fees up-front or interest during the course of the loan is dependent on the local religious and cultural practices in the areas where these organizations operate.

Loan disbursal
Why is it hard to track if a post-disbursed loan is dependent on Kiva lender funding?
Direct loans on Kiva are always post-disbursed. That means that if the loan doesn't fully fundraise on Kiva's website, the borrower won't receive the loan. Partner loans may be pre- or post-disbursed. With partner loans, Kiva's Field Partners are the ones responsible for screening borrowers, disbursing loans, collecting repayments and otherwise administering Kiva loans on the ground. When a borrower receives a loan through Kiva's Field Partner, they have gone through an approval process, evaluating their credit-worthiness and likelihood of repaying their loan. If a Field Partner has cash available when they approve a borrower for a loan, they may choose to give out that loan right away, prior to posting it to Kiva for funding. By pre-disbursing a loan, they're helping to ensure the borrower gets their funds as soon as they're needed, instead of having to wait until the loan fundraises on Kiva. However, some of Kiva's Field Partners don't have the cash available to do this, so they must wait until they receive the funding from Kiva lenders to disburse a loan. Regardless of whether a loan is pre- or post-disbursed, when a partner posts a loan to Kiva, they're doing so because they believe that the borrower is worthy of receiving a loan, and they hope that Kiva lenders will choose support the borrower, thus assuming the risk for that loan.If a partner loan is post-disbursed and does not get funded on Kiva's platform, oftentimes the borrower will not get the loan (a majority of our partners who post-disburse loans don't have other sources of funding besides Kiva). However, if a loan isn't supported by Kiva lenders and the partner has the resources to do so, they may choose to still give out that loan to the borrower, using other sources of capital.It's hard for Kiva to track which post-disbursed partner loans won't happen without the support of lenders for a variety of reasons. First, the financial situation of a partner can change relatively quickly. One month a partner may only be able to finance loans through Kiva, whereas the next month they may have leveraged their relationship with Kiva in ways to get additional sources of funding. Because this situation can fluctuate on a regular basis, it's difficult to know for certain if a loan on Kiva that has a future disbursal date will be able to be given out even if it isn't funded by Kiva lenders.In addition, the Partnerships Team at Kiva has chosen not to invest the resources in tracking this on a routine basis, given limited staff time and the number of partners each person must manage (it typically takes 2 people to manage 25-30 partners). Our Portfolio Managers and Portfolio Associates already monitor a lot of details about their partners, focusing their efforts on key tasks such as the overall financial health of the Field Partner, accuracy of the loan information (through borrower verifications), monthly repayment reporting and conducting updated risk models every 24 months.

Delinquency (PAR) rate
Delinquency rate is the percentage of paying back loans by this Field Partner that are past due in repayment. This is a conservative early indicator of a Field Partner's long term default rate. It's conservative because there is still a chance a borrower or partner will fully repay the amount owed before the end of the loan term, even if they are behind currently. How this is calculated: Delinquency rate = Amount of Paying Back Loans Delinquent / Amount of Paying Back Loans

What happens to my free trial $25 after I lend?
Loans made using a free trial are disbursed to borrowers in the same way other loans are disbursed on Kiva. However, since a sponsor is funding the loan, any repayments from that loans will go back to the sponsor, not to the lender. Our hope is that lenders who make their first loan as part of a free trial or promotion will enjoy the experience of lending so much that they'll choose to deposit their own funds into Kiva to make even more loans.

India loans
Why are repayments not available for 43 months on most India loans?
India has a unique regulatory landscape, and the Reserve Bank of India requires that any funding that comes into the country for a non-governmental microfinance institution must remain in the country for at least 3 years. Typically, with Kiva, lenders get repaid as the borrower repays their loan. With India loans, however, lenders will not be repaid until the end of the 43 month term, which is slightly longer than 3 years because of the way that Kiva’s fundraising and billing system works. Field Partners in India will collect borrower repayments on a regular basis, but they may only be sent to Kiva lenders at the end of the 43 month term.Please note, this 43 month term does not apply to loans made through Kiva's Field Partners Novica, Barefoot Power, and Milaap. Each of these Field Partners has operations outside of India, which means that certain regulations set by the Reserve Bank of India do not apply to these loans.

Loan at risk rate - spanish
La tasa de riesgo de los préstamos se refiere al porcentaje de préstamos Kiva que están siendo pagados por este Socio de campo que están vencidos en el pago por al menos 1 día (también conocidos como atrasos). Esta morosidad puede deberse a la falta de pago de los prestatarios de Kiva o la falta de pago del propio Field Partner.Préstamos a tasa de riesgo = $ valor pendiente de morosidad en el pago de préstamos en estado de devolución / $ valor pendiente de pago de todos los préstamos en estado de devolución.Ejemplo: un socio tiene cinco préstamos que están en estado de "devolución" y el monto del préstamo para cada uno es de $ 100. Todos los préstamos tienen primeras cuotas de $ 10. Un prestatario paga solo $ 9 y, por lo tanto, su préstamo está en mora. Los otros cuatro prestatarios pagan $ 10. La tasa de riesgo de los préstamos es de 91/451 = 20,18%.La tasa de riesgo de los préstamos es un agregado que no distingue entre la morosidad del prestatario y la morosidad del socio. Entonces, en el ejemplo anterior, la tasa de riesgo de los préstamos será del 20,18%, independientemente de si es el prestatario o socio el que está atrasado en los reembolsos.

Loan matching
Will I receive the repayments on matched loans?
The matched contribution to a loan is made using the loan matcher's account and will not be counted toward your personal lending stats -- for example, if you lend $25 to a borrower and that is matched with a $25 loan made by a loan matcher, your account will only reflect the total amount lent of $25. Because of this, when the borrower makes a repayment on their loan, you will only receive repayments on the contribution you made, not on the contribution made by the loan matcher.

>
Repayments
Why hasn't the borrower I supported paid?
Every loan on Kiva is posted with its own unique repayment schedule, which lets lenders know when repayments should be expected on loans. Unfortunately, sometimes borrower or partners may fall behind on repayment according to that original schedule. If a borrower becomes behind on repayment, it is common to try to reschedule loans in order to accommodate the eventual repayment of the loan. While we don't require partners to share updates when a borrower falls behind on repayment, we do encourage them to do so, as we know lenders like to know what's going on with the borrowers they support. At Kiva we define default or non-repayment as the time when Kiva determines that collection of funds from a borrower
or Field Partner is doubtful and 180 days past the originally scheduled
repayment date (for any expected repayment, not just at the term of the
loan). When a Kiva loan defaults, we notify all contributing lenders by email.

Kiva's Field Partners
What does fundraising status mean?
The fundraising status lets you know whether or not a Field Partner is actively raising funds on Kiva's platform. Kiva adjusts the fundraising status of each Field Partner based on time and performance. Combined with the Field Partner risk rating, the fundraising status determines the number of loans a Field Partner can post in a given month. Kiva Field Partners can be in any of the following statuses:Active: An active partner is currently raising funds on Kiva.Inactive: An inactive partner is not currently posting new loans, but is in good standing with Kiva. A partner may be in inactive status for a variety of reasons, such as operational constraints preventing them from posting loans. Kiva monitors inactive partners according to their outstanding balance, with a higher level of monitoring conducted on partners with higher balances.
Paused: A paused partner has been restricted from raising funds while Kiva reviews a potential issue. A partner may be paused for a variety of reasons, such as excessive delinquency or default on Kiva loans, a violation of Kiva policies, or external factors such as country-related regulatory constraints.
Closed: A partnership will be closed when Kiva no longer works with this organization.

Social underwriting & risk
Why does Kiva US require borrowers to invite their own lenders?
Kiva US borrowers must invite lenders from their own network to fund their loan before they are posted live to the Kiva website for the larger Kiva lender community to support. This as an important measure of the borrower’s trust network and hope that the lenders invited by the borrower will help keep them accountable for repaying their loan. Depending on the size of the loan and other factors, borrowers are required to invite between 5 and 25 lenders from their network.We ask borrowers to recruit lenders from their own networks for three principal reasons:- Borrowers who invite their own networks have a significantly higher repayment rate on their loans.- We’ve found that loans fundraise much faster when the immediate network of the borrower is engaged in the fundraising period. When lenders see that a borrower has some skin in the game because they have invited their own friends and family to lend to them, we believe they're more likely to make contributions of their own.- Inviting lenders fuels the growth of the Kiva US program, allowing us to support more entrepreneurs.

While Field Partners may request payment from borrowers, and some Field Partners are profitable, Kiva carefully chooses to partner with organizations that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved, and our due diligence methods include thorough analyses of the costs and benefits of individual loan products. Moreover, partners with a very high cost to borrowers undergo additional annual screening by Kiva to further review their pricing rationale.Currently, there are 4 different types of information about our Field Partners that may appear in this Average Cost to Borrower field: Portfolio Yield (PY), Annual Percentage Rate (APR), Monthly Percentage Rate (MPR) and Not Applicable (N/A). Kiva displays only versions of these rates that are nominal, meaning that the effect of inflation in each country is not taken into account. See The World Factbook for a publicly available list of inflation rates.For this specific Field Partner, Kiva displays N/A (Not Applicable) because the structures of the particular loan products used by the partner do not allow for a standard pricing calculation. For example, the loan products may have loan repayments linked to the borrowers' revenues or profits, or to repayments from carbon credits or clean energy utility charges. In other cases, the Field Partner may not charge borrowers directly, but may work with third-party intermediaries that do charge borrowers. In each of these cases, Kiva will provide detailed descriptions of the relevant pricing practices in loan alert text and on partner pages.

Kiva displays only versions of these rates that are nominal, meaning that the effect of inflation in each country is not taken into account. See The World Factbook for a publicly available list of inflation rates.For this specific Field Partner, Kiva displays Monthly Percentage Rate (MPR), which represents the estimated average cost paid by a borrower to this Field Partner to access a loan posted on Kiva, with that cost normalized per month and converted into a percentage rate. In certain rare cases where Field Partners provide very short term loans to borrowers, Kiva believes that MPR is a more transparent method of representing cost than the more common Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Using tools provided by MicroFinance Transparency, Kiva calculates this MPR based on a detailed analysis of the types of loans this Field Partner has posted and/or plans to post on Kiva.Showing an MPR value does not always imply that the Field Partner charges interest on its loans. Kiva works with Field Partners across many sectors, including some that don't provide cash loans to borrowers. Instead, these partners provide impactful products or services, which the borrower pays for over time. Thus, the total costs paid by a borrower to a Field Partner may (or may not) include interest charges, fees, security deposits, rent or other delayed payments for the delivery of goods or services.

How are free trials funded?
Free trials are funded by generous Kiva supporters. These supporters are interested in helping Kiva attract new audiences and grow our lender community, so they choose to give funding to support free trials as a way to encourage new people to join Kiva. With free trial loans, people new to Kiva have the opportunity to make a $25 loan to a Kiva borrower without having to use their own money. These loans are disbursed to borrowers in the same way other loans are disbursed on Kiva. However, since a supporter is funding the loan, any repayments on the loan will go back to sponsor, not to the lender. Our hope is that you'll enjoy the experience of lending on Kiva so much that you’ll want to deposit your own funds into Kiva to make even more loans.

What are innovative loan product loans?
Innovative loan product loans are designed to specifically meet the needs of unique populations they serve. Traditional microfinance loans are distributed in cash and have regular, fixed repayment plans, making them well-suited to the needs of entrepreneurs with predictable income streams. However, some borrowers require more unique or flexible financing. Innovative loan products include: loans repaid in-kind rather than in cash, loans repaid from carbon credit revenue, loans with repayments based on a percentage of borrowers' income or profits, loans with flexible repayment schedules and other innovative loans that are pushing the boundaries of traditional microfinance.

Why aren’t larger loans being provided by traditional banks?
Traditional banks don’t often serve small enterprises for many of the same reasons they don’t serve entrepreneurs with traditional microloans. One of the primary reasons is that it simply isn’t profitable. Many businesses prefer to remain in the informal sector and do not have bank accounts. Those that do have bank accounts are relatively small and have much lower revenue potential per enterprise than larger businesses. On top of that, it’s common for these small enterprises to need technical assistance related to best business practices, which can add to the bank’s overhead costs. Unless banks view this sector as a viable market, it’s unlikely they’ll develop the necessary strategy, products, delivery channels and risk management systems to address it.There are also many regulatory barriers that can diminish the incentives a bank may have to work with smaller enterprises. For example, banks may have difficulty with enforcing a loan’s collateral, lowering operational costs through out-of-court settlements or having well-protected creditor rights during a default. Finally, there’s typically a lack of financial infrastructure in many of these regions. Specifically, a lack of robust credit reporting systems, accounting and auditing standards, insolvency regimes, as well as functioning payments and settlements systems which help address legal uncertainties that lenders face.

Since the funding you received is via Kiva's Donor-Advised Fund, all of Kiva's Field Partners have to sign an amended agreement in order to receive these funds.

What happens to lender funds when they’re held in India?
While Kiva loan terms for loans in India are set at 43 months, Indian borrowers may pay back their loan in a shorter period of time. If the borrower pays back in less than 43 months, the Field Partner has the option to disburse the funds to another borrower, provided that the second loan will be fully repaid within the 43 month period. The Field Partner will cover the borrower risk of the second loan.

What are underfunded area loans?
Loans to borrowers in underfunded areas reach those people who live in particularly remote areas with scarce resources or a limited penetration of financial services. Underfunded areas also include countries that have a hard time accessing capital to support microfinance. These borrowers have very limited options for financing because of where they are located. By funding a loan in an underfunded area you are helping provide financial services to these excluded areas.

Arrears can result from late repayments from Kiva borrowers as well as delayed payments from the Field Partner.How this is calculated: delinquency (arrears) rate = $ value of payments past due of delinquent paying back loans / outstanding $ value of all paying back loans

Currency exchange loss
What does it mean for currency to depreciate? Why does depreciation occur?
Currency depreciation refers to a decline in the value of one currency relative to another currency. Depreciation occurs when, because of a change in exchange rates, a unit of one currency buys fewer units of another currency. For instance, if the US dollar depreciates relative to the Euro, the exchange rate (the Dollar price of Euros) rises; therefore, it takes more Dollars to purchase 1 Euro.
