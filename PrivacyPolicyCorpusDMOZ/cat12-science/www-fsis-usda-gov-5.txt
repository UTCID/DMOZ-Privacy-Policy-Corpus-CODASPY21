Information Quality
OMB M-19-15 is in effect.
Where To Submit a Formal Request For Correction
In compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Quality of Information Guidelines, this page provides information pertaining to requests for correction of information disseminated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Requestors seeking a correction should follow the procedure described by the USDA's Quality of Information Guidelines. (Select "Correction Information.")
The USDA Information Quality Guidelines correction mechanisms are not intended to imply any rights of individuals to request amendment of their own records beyond those permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other organization-specific laws.
All requests for correction of FSIS information must be submitted by letter, fax, or email to:
Gina Kouba
Office of Policy and Program Development
Policy Issuances Division
Room 3532 South Building
1400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20250-3700
Phone: (202) 690-6510
Fax: (202) 690-0486
Email: Gina.Kouba@fsis.usda.gov
Information That Should Be Submitted to FSIS with a Request for Correction
Requests for correction of information should include the following elements:
Statement that the Request for Correction of Information is Submitted Under USDA's Information Quality Guidelines
Requestor Contact Information
The name, mailing address, telephone number, fax number (if any), Email address (if any), and organizational affiliation (if any) of the person requesting the correction.
Description of Information to Correct
The name of the FSIS publication, report, or data product; the date of issuance or other identifying information such as the URL of the web page; and a detailed description that clearly identifies the specific information contained in that publication, report, or data product for which a correction is being sought.
Explanation of Noncompliance with OMB and/or USDA Information Quality Guidelines
An explanation that describes how the information fails to meet either the OMB or USDA Information Quality Guidelines.
Explanation of the Effect of the Alleged Error
An explanation that describes the requestor's use of the information in question and how the requestor is affected by the alleged error.
Recommendation and Justification for How the Information Should Be Corrected
The requestor should state specifically how the information should be corrected and explain why the corrections should be made. A request for correction that is specific and provides evidence to support the need for correction is likely to be more persuasive than a request that is general, unfocused, or that simply indicates disagreement with the information in question.
This guidance for the content of requests for correction of information is not intended to constitute a set of legally binding requirements. Requestors bear the "burden of proof" with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek. However, the Food Safety and Inspection Service may be unable to process, in a timely fashion or at all, requests that omit one or more of the requested elements. The Food Safety and Information Service will base its decision on the merits of the information provided by the requestor.
Privacy Act Statement
USDA is authorized to obtain certain information under Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law No. 106-554, codified at 44 U.S.C. 3516, note). Information is needed by USDA to process the request for correction and allow USDA to reply accordingly. This information is needed by USDA to respond to the requestor and initiate follow-up contact with the requestor if required. Requestors should not send USDA their Social Security Number. Requestors are advised that they do not have to furnish the information but failure to do so may prevent their request from being processed. The information requestors furnish is almost never used for any purpose other than to process and respond to their request. However, USDA may disclose information to a Congressional office in response to an inquiry made on behalf of the requestor, to the Department of Justice, a court, other tribunal when the information is relevant and necessary to litigation, or to a contractor or another Federal agency to help accomplish a function related to this process.
We are continually seeking to improve our Quality of Information Guidelines. Please submit comments and suggestions about these guidelines to: Gina.Kouba@fsis.usda.gov. For comments regarding the site itself: fsis.webmaster@fsis.usda.gov.
