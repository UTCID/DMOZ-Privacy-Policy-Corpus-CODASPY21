We may share this anonymised data with our trusted partners to assist them in research or marketing products and services to you that are likely to be relevant to your interests and preferences.We may also share with certain media agencies, publishers and partners, such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, anonymous unique identifiers ('hashed data’) allocated to you. This identifier may be associated with information collected when you engage with us, for example by subscribing to our e-newsletters, visiting our websites or digital platforms, using our approved agencies, buying a ticket, making a booking, or calling, emailing, faxing or mailing us. This is so that we can together provide you with customised content when you visit certain websites and provide other visitors to those websites with customised advertising.Otherwise, the AM will only disclose personal information if this is required by law, for example under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW), permitted under this Privacy Statement, or permitted under the NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) or the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW).The AM will not sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.Names and email addresses of AM staff appearing on this website are provided with their knowledge and assent.3.1.
