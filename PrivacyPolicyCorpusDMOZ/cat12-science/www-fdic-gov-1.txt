This information is technical in nature, is not used to identify who you are, and is collected in the aggregate for statistical purposes.

a. Use and Sharing of Personal Information Various employees of the FDIC may see the information you submit in the course of their official duties. The information may also be shared by the FDIC with third parties to advance the purpose for which you provide the information. Specifically:
If you file a complaint, it may be sent to the appropriate financial institution and/or federal, state, or local government agencies for action or information may be supplied to the Department of Justice in the event it appears that federal criminal statutes have been violated by an entity you are reporting to the FDIC. The primary use of personal information you provide will be to enable the government to contact you in the event we have questions regarding the information you have reported.
If you register with an FDIC online mailing list, the information you provide may be used to send you FDIC communications or notify you about updates to our Web site.
If you submit an order via FDIC's Online Product Catalog, the information you supply is used only by authorized FDIC personnel and vendors for the sole purpose of processing and fulfilling your order.
If you register for a non-deposit claim, the information you provide will be used by FDIC to certify your account ownership and process/resolve your claim. The information you provide is not shared with third parties.
In general, if you send us information or correspondence by e-mail, an online form, or any other means, you are consenting to the FDIC using the information provided therein, including personally identifying information, in accordance with this notice, unless you expressly state in your correspondence your objection to any use(s). Please note that under certain circumstances, the FDIC may be required or authorized by law to disclose information you submit to the Corporation, for example, to respond to a Congressional inquiry or subpoena.
b. Retention of Information
We may retain electronically submitted information as long as necessary to respond to your request, depending on the subject matter and according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the FDIC does not require children to reveal any information that could personally identify them. If, however, a child chooses to provide us with personally identifying information, through an e-mail, Web form or other means, it will only be used to respond to the writer's question(s) or request(s). The information will not be retained, used for another purpose, or shared with third parties.
5. Your Rights Under the Privacy Act
The Privacy Act Regulations protects the personal information the federal government keeps on individuals in Systems of Records (SOR).
Please note that the Privacy Act does not cover all information collected online.
More detailed information visit the Privacy Act, including a listing of FDIC Systems of Records Notices (SORNs).
6. Social Networking
In order to encourage greater public
participation, collaboration, and transparency, the FDIC currently maintains official Corporation accounts on commercial
social media sites, including Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, and Twitter. The
FDIC does not own or operate these sites.
These sites are owned, controlled and operated by non-government third parties.
As such, the FDIC's
Online Privacy Policy does not apply to, or
have authority over, the privacy policy of any commercial social media sites
you may visit. Therefore, if you choose to provide information or interact with
the FDIC on a commercial third-party site, please review carefully the privacy
policy of the third party. Click on the following to view the privacy policies
of Youtube, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.
Additionally, the Corporation does not actively
collect, maintain, share, or disseminate information posted by visitors to these
commercial third-party social media sites.
However, if a posting indicates a potential threat or violation of law, such as a threat of
criminal action or harm to financial institutions, the Corporation will take
appropriate action to share the information with appropriate internal and
external parties, as would be taken with any other such information in the
public domain.
7. Security and Intrusion Detection Monitoring
This government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to protect the transmission of the information you submit to us when you use one of our secure online forms.
Do not e-mail the FDIC sensitive information such as Social Security or account numbers.
Instead, contact us by using our secure online forms or by phone.
