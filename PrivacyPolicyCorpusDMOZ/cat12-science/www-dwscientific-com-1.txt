The privacy policy outlined below can be found on the Don Whitley Scientific website and is accessible to everyone who visits the website. There are also several instances when a data subject may be directed to read the Privacy Policy to ensure they are aware of our processing procedures and reasons for collecting their data.
This document is approved by the directors prior to publication on any DWS external website.
This privacy policy sets out how Don Whitley Scientific Limited (DWS) uses and protects any information that you give us when you use this website.
Data from the website is collected by our Data Processor, Rejuvenate Productions, the company that hosts the Don Whitley Scientific website. Don Whitley Scientific is the Data Controller and is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected in line with the Data Protection Act 1998. If we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Don Whitley Scientific may make changes to this policy as it is reviewed once a year during a data protection compliance audit to make sure it still accurately covers what data we collect, what we do with the data and our policy for protecting personal data.
What personal information we may collect
We may collect the following information:
name and job title
contact information including email address
demographic information such as postcode, preferences and interests
other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers
What we do with the information we gather
We may collect this information to allow us to contact you to deal with your request or enquiry; to understand your needs and to provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:
Internal record keeping.
We may use the information to improve our products and services.
If you have registered for our news bulletins we will periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting, using the email address which you have provided.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. We may contact you by email, phone or mail.
We may also collect information that monitors activity whilst you use this website or if you share any of its content by clicking the social media buttons. This information is purely analytical data and no personal details are stored against this information.
Your personal data will never be shared with any third party organisations other than where we have a legal duty to do so.
Legal basis for processing your data
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
We will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
Security
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Data retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we delete your data from our system, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files containing pieces of information that websites can store on your computer's hard disk. Cookies enable users to navigate around the website and (where appropriate) allow us to continually improve the website and make it more efficient to use on future visits.
We use two types of cookies on this website:
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your machine only for as long as you are on the website and are deleted after each visit.
Persistent cookies which remain on your machine until expiry or deletion (many of these have automatic deletion dates). Persistent cookies may store your personal preferences, for example your language preferences on multi-lingual sites. They may also be used to record activity you may have previously completed, such as completing an online survey, so that you are not asked to complete the survey every time you use the site.
How we use cookies on our website
We use some 'strictly necessary' cookies within our online services. These are limited to those deemed essential to provide you with the services you have requested therefore must be allowed to continue with that service.
In addition, we use cookies to:
Collect anonymous information that will help us understand visitor browsing habits on our website; compile statistical reports on website activity, e.g. number of visitors and the pages they visit; in some cases, remember information about you when you visit our site. We may need to do this to provide some of our services.
We sometimes use third parties to assist us in the analysis of visits to and performance of our website, but no personal information is collected and no personal information is sent to the third parties for this purpose.
We do not use cookies to track your use of the internet after you leave our site, nor do we use them to store any personal information in them that others could read and understand.
Changing your cookie settings
You can block any cookies from any website through your browser settings. For more specific information about how to do this and how to manage cookies to suit your preferences, including deleting those that have already been added to your computer, please visit www.aboutcookies.org.
If you share the use of a computer, accepting or rejecting the use of cookies will affect all users of that computer.
Consent to cookies
If you continue to use this site without disabling cookies we will take that as your consent for us to place cookies on your computer. Please remember if you do disable cookies then some parts of our website may not work properly and you will not be able to use some of our services.
Links to other websites
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest or social media platforms. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over other websites. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and they are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
Controlling your personal information
You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:
Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that requests you to tick to confirm your consent to receiving a limited amount of direct marketing.
If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by completing the ‘Contact Us’ form, or by clicking ‘Unsubscribe’ at the bottom of any e-bulletin sent via Mailchimp.
If you have any privacy-related questions or unresolved problems, you may contact us by completing the ‘Contact Us’ form.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.)
You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the General Data Protection Regulations 2016 (GDPR). No administration fee will be charged for considering and/or complying with such a request unless the request is deemed to be unnecessary or excessive in nature.
We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm that your personal information remains correct and up-to-date or choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us or some of our partners.
