Data processing
General information
Scope of personal data processing
We process users' personal data only insofar as is required for the provision of a functional website and of our content and services. Users' personal data is processed only with their consent except where the processing is permitted under law and it has not been possible to obtain the user's permission in advance.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Insofar as we obtain permission from the data subject for the processing of their personal data, the legal basis is art. 6 para. 1 a of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
For the processing of personal data for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, the legal basis is art. 6 para. 1 b GDPR. This also applies for processing required for pre-contractual measures.
Where the processing of personal data is required for complying with our legal obligations, the legal basis is art. 6 para. 1 c GDPR.
In the event that the processing of personal data is in the essential interests of the data subject or of another natural person, the legal basis is art. 6 para. 1 d GDPR.
Where processing is in our legitimate interests or those of a third party, and the interests and basic rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh such interests, the legal basis for the processing is art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Deletion of data and duration of storage
The data subject's personal data will be deleted or locked as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally stored. Data can in addition be saved if allowed for by EU or national legislators in EU regulations, statutes or other regulations to which the data controller is subject. Data can also be locked or deleted if a storage period allowed under the aforementioned norms expires, unless the continued storage of the data is required for formation or performance of contract.
Provision of website and creation of logfiles
Description and scope of data processing
Every time a user accesses our website, our system automatically captures the following data and information about the user's computer system:
Browser type and version
User's operating system
User's Internet service provider
User's IP address
Date and time of access
Website from which user arrives at our website
Websites accessed by user from our website
This data is stored in our system's logfiles. It is not stored with other personal data relating to the user.
Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and logfiles is art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
The temporary storage of the user's IP address in our system for the duration of the user's session is necessary to ensure our website can be delivered to the user's computer.
Data is stored in logfiles to guarantee the functionality of our website. The data also helps us to optimise our website and ensure our IT systems are secure. The data is not in this context used for marketing purposes.
The aforementioned aims also constitute our legitimate interest in data processing as per art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Duration of storage
Data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. Where data is captured for the purposes of making the website available,  it is deleted when the user's session ends.
Where data is stored in logfiles, it is deleted after seven days at the latest, although it may be saved for longer, in which case the user's IP address will be deleted or anonymised so that the accessing client can no longer be identified.
Objection and removal
The capture of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in logfiles are necessary for the functioning of our website. The user therefore has no right of objection.
Use of cookies
Description and scope of data processing
Some of our websites/web applications use cookies. Cookies are text files that are saved on the user's computer system in or by the browser software. If a user accesses a website, a cookie can be stored on their operating system. This cookie contains a unique identification code that enables the user's browser to be recognised when the user revisits the website.
We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website require the accessing browser to be identifiable even after the user has gone to a different site.
The cookies save and transmit the following information:
Language settings
Log-in information
On our websites we also use cookies that enable users' surfing behaviour to be analysed. This means that the following data can be transmitted:
Search terms entered
Frequency of site access
Use of website functions
Page last visited
Path of last search enquiry
Technical precautions are taken to ensure that the data collected in this way is anonymised. Therefore the data cannot be matched with the user and it is not stored with other personal data relating to the user.
When you access our website, a message will inform you that cookies are used on the site for analysis purposes and will direct you to this data protection statement. You will also learn how to prevent cookies being saved by adjusting your browser settings.
Legal basis for data processing
The legal basis for using cookies to process personal data is art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
We use cookies for technical reasons in order to make use of the website easier for users. Without cookies, some of the functions of our website will not work. These functions require that, when you return to our site, your browser is recognised.
We need cookies for the following uses:
Acceptance of language settings
Registering search terms
Registering last-visited website
The user data we collect for technical purposes via cookies is not used to create user profiles.
We use analysis cookies in order to improve the quality of our websites and their content. They enable us to see how our websites are used and thus to constantly optimise our service.
These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in the processing of personal data as per art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Duration of storage; objection and removal
Cookies are saved on the user's computer and transferred from there to our site. Therefore you as user have full control over the use of cookies. By adjusting your browser settings you can deactivate or restrict the transfer of cookies. Cookies already saved can be deleted at any time and they can also be deleted automatically, but deletion may result in restricted usability of some of the functions of our website.
Web analysis by Matomo
Scope of personal data processing
On our websites we use the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly PIWIK) to analyse users' surfing behaviour. This software places a cookie (see above) on the user's computer. When individual pages of our websites are accessed, the following data is saved:
Two bytes of IP address of accessing system
Web page accessed
The referrer website from which the user has arrived at the web page accessed
The subsequent pages visited from the web page accessed
Dwell time on the web page
Frequency of web page access
The software runs solely on our servers. Users' personal data is stored only there and is not shared with any third party.
The software is used in such a way that IP addresses cannot be saved in full. Two bytes of the address are masked (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx). It is therefore not possible to match the abbreviated IP address to the accessing computer.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Legal basis for the processing of personal data is art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
Processing users' personal data enables us to analyse their surfing behaviour. Evaluating this data enables us to compile information about the use of individual elements of our websites, which in turn aids the continuous improvement of our websites and their user-friendliness. This is also the basis for our legitimate interest in the processing of data as per art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR. In anonymising IP addresses we pay due regard to the users' interest in the protection of their personal data.
Duration of storage
Data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our recording purposes (in our case, after 180 days).
Objection and removal
Cookies are saved on the user's computer and then transferred from there to our site. Therefore you as user have full control over the use of cookies. By adjusting your browser settings you can deactivate or restrict the transfer of cookies. Cookies already saved can be deleted at any time, including automatically, but in this case some of the functions of our websites may not be fully available.
On our websites you can opt out of the analysis process by following the relevant link. This will save another cookie on your computer that signals to our system not to save your data. If you then delete this cookie from your system, you will have to re-set it later.

App
DESY Phone Book app
The Login occurs via Basic Authentication against a web service*. The user name and password are transmitted via a POST request to the address mentioned below, using SSL-encryption. On the server side an SSL-encrypted LDAP authentication takes place.
If the login is successful, a random hash will be generated on the server. This is stored on the respective device (in the app) and on the server together with a timestamp. Each query will be scanned to ensure that the local-stored hash matches the one on the server and is not older than 180 days. If the respective hash file is older or not matching, the user has to reenter their ID.
At no time will passwords be stored on the smartphone.

Web Fonts
This website uses web fonts, provided by Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. through fast.fonts.net, for the purpose of a uniform typeface. To determine the number of page views for web pages that use Monotype-licensed web fonts, the browser you are using must connect to the servers of fast.fonts.net.
Thereby, fast.fonts.net becomes aware that your IP address has been used to access our website. The use of Fonts.com web fonts is in the interest of a uniform layout of our websites. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font will be used by your computer.
For more information, please refer to Monotype's Privacy Policy:
https://www.monotype.com/legal/privacy-policy/web-font-tracking-privacy-policy/
Social media
Two-click process for enhanced data protection
In order to protect our users' privacy and data, we use the tried-and-tested two-click process, also known as the Shariff Solution, for recommendations made within social networks. The use of this process means that our websites are delivered with inactive buttons that do not transfer any data to social networks. Users can nonetheless manually activate the buttons, thereby creating a connection to their preferred network (first click). The second step involves the user then giving their recommendation (second click). The activation of one of the buttons in the first step therefore means that the user consents to transmit data to the social network concerned for this one page and for the requested service.
Data protection regulations for use of Facebook
Some of our websites contain plug-ins provided by the social network Facebook.
A social network is an Internet-based social meeting point, an online community that allows its users to communicate with one another and to interact in a virtual environment. Facebook enables users to create private profiles, upload photos and to connect with one another via 'friend' requests.
The operator of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, US. For data subjects outside of the US and Canada, the data controller with responsibility for data processing is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Every time a page that is operated by the data controller is accessed and on which a Facebook plug-in is embedded, the Facebook plug-in concerned makes the browser on the data subject's computer download a copy of the Facebook plug-in from Facebook. On overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be obtained from https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE As a result, Facebook learns which specific pages of our website have been visited by the data subject.
If the data subject is at the same time logged in to their Facebook account, Facebook learns which pages of our website the data subject visits over the entire duration of their session. This information is gathered by the Facebook plug-in and then allocated by Facebook to the data subject's Facebook account.
If the data subject is logged into their Facebook account at the same time as they visit our site, Facebook learns via its plug-in that the data subject has visited our website. This happens regardless of whether or not the data subject clicks on the Facebook plug-in. If you wish to prevent the sharing of this information with Facebook, you should log out of your Facebook account before visiting our website.
The data guidelines issued by Facebook at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/ contain information on how data is collected, processed and used by Facebook. They also explain how to adjust your Facebook settings to protect your privacy. Various applications are available that enable you to prevent your data being transferred to Facebook.
Data protection regulations for using Twitter
Some of our websites use elements of Twitter. Twitter is a multilingual public microblogging platform on which users can publish and distribute 'tweets' (short messages of 280 characters or fewer). These tweets can be accessed by everyone, including by people not registered with Twitter. Twitter enables users to communicate with a wide audience using hashtags, links and retweets.
Twitter is operated by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, US.
Every time you access one of the pages operated by the data controller and in which a Twitter component has been embedded, your browser will automatically download a copy of the Twitter component concerned onto your system. For more information on the Twitter timeline visit https://help.twitter.com/de/using-twitter/embed-twitter-feed
If you are at the same time logged in to your Twitter account then, every time you access the website on which the Twitter components are embedded, Twitter will know which pages of our website you visit. This information will be gathered by the Twitter components and assigned by Twitter to your Twitter account.
If when you access our website you are at the same time logged in to your Twitter account, Twitter will via these components be informed of your visit and this will happen regardless of whether you click on the Twitter components or not. If you do not wish this information to be shared with Twitter in this way, you should log out of your Twitter account before accessing our website.
Twitter's data protection regulations can be read at https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=de
Use of external search engines
Our websites use Google's user-defined search function (Google Custom Search Engine, or "Google CSE") as their main search engine. The embedded search facility enables full-text search for content on our publicly accessible websites. This search facility can be accessed via the search box embedded in the page header of the individual websites concerned.
When you enter a search term into the search box and then hit return or click on the search symbol, you activate the search function and your results will be shown on a results page, which downloads the Google search results using a Google plug-in. In this way data is transferred to the search service.
The plug-in developed and provided by Google ("Google CSE") is embedded by the operator in the search results page. When the search results page is accessed, the plug-in enables automated communication (data exchange) between the search results page displayed and Google. The use of the search function provided by Google encompasses a dynamic transfer of data via Google.
Data is not shared with Google until you conduct a search and thereby access the search results page. By using the search function within the search results page, you will at the same time share your data with Google, but if you use our websites without using Google's user-defined search function, no data will be shared with the search engine provider (Google).
By using the search function and thus accessing the search results page, you consent to the sharing of data with Google. This includes for example the search terms you enter and the IP address of your device.
If you are at the same time logged in with Google, Google can allocate the information directly to your user profile. More information about how Google uses users' data can be found in their data protection statement at http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy
Use of external map services
Data protection regulations for use of Google Maps
Some of our website use Google Maps to show locations. Google Maps is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US. By using this website you consent to the capture, processing and use of the data that is automatically collected, and of the data that you enter, by Google, its agents and external service providers.
See Google Maps for their terms and conditions of use. For more details on the relevant data protection regulations see https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
Payment services and processes
Scope of personal data processing
When booking conferences or other events, you may be transferred to our payment service provider, TeleCash GmbH & Co. KG. In such cases we will provide only an ID to which the payment can later be allocated. Other personal data will be collected by the payment service provider on its own behalf under the terms of its data protection statement.
Legal basis for personal data processing
The legal basis for the transfer of data is art. 6 (1) b GDPR.
Purpose of data processing
For the allocation of payments at TeleCash GmbH & Co. KG to the correct conference/seminar registrations, an ID will be created and passed to the service provider together with the registration.
Duration of storage
We will save the payment ID and payment status together with the data that we collect when you register for a conference. The duration of the storage will depend on the registration concerned.
