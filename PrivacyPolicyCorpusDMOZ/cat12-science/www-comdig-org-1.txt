The Internet has forever changed so many aspects of everyday life. Virtually everyone is carrying around a powerful computing device that can quickly and easily access information in a vast array of online databases. This is great news for just about everyone, but it does come at a cost.
It used to be that your personal information, government records, and medical history were very difficult to get a hold of. Someone would probably have to hire a private investigator and even then only a small portion of your information would be available.
Now millions of records from thousands of databases can be searched in a matter of seconds to find out information about you. Every day even more data is being added to the online world in various digital collections and databases. This presents all sorts of privacy issues.
