Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Version 3.0 - May 25, 2018
Introduction
iChemLabs takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that may be collected by this or any iChemLabs owned site.
In addition to our goal of handling personal data in a transparent manor, we also comply with EU Data Protection Laws, and offer users of our products, services, and web sites, choice and consent with regard to personal data.
Also, please take time to read iChemLabs' terms of use.
Overview
When do we collect personal data
iChemLabs only collects personal data on someone when they become a customer by purchasing our software, signing up for a license for one of our services, or requesting a quote for pricing of products or services. We never collect personal data when people simply peruse our website or trial our software.
We do log IP addresses of visitors to our website in our web logs in order to fight abuse. For instance, if we detect a specific IP address is attempting to "break into" our website, we will ban that IP address forever. However, we cannot associate this IP address with any real person.
What do we collect when someone becomes a customer
We collect your name, address, phone number, purchase date, time, and type and any other data as required to service your account.
We employ a reseller who actually collects payment on our behalf. This reseller does not share any of your financial information (i.e., credit card number, expiration, bank checking account, etc.) with us and therefore, we do not collect or store any financial information anywhere on our servers. Currently our exclusive reseller is BMT Micro. They have their own privacy policy which is out of our control, and we encourage you to read it.
How long do we save the personal data
We retain this data as long as necessary to service your account. This may be forever as we need to be able to provide an invoice if requested, provide services such as recovery of your activation code (what other companies call license keys or registration keys), and to reward you with appropriate discounts on upgrades.
Advertising
We do not advertise on this or any iChemLabs owned websites. We do not accept ads, display ads, or sell ads. We also do not sell any of your information to any third party who might use it for advertising purposes.
How to access your data
We will make good-faith efforts to provide you with access to your data for review or correction. To request a dump of the data that we have collected to service your purchase, contact us at the following address by certified mail:
iChemLabs LLC.
7305 Hancock Village Dr #525
Chesterfield, VA 23832
The certified letter must be addressed from the address you supplied when purchasing a product or service as email addresses can be compromised and/or spoofed.
Collection of Data
You are not required to provide any information on our website if you do not want to. Please be aware that if you purchase a product, fill out our contact form, request support, or send us email the e-mail address you provide and other information you provide may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (for example if you provide a testimonial) or unintentionally (such as, but not limited to, subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, iChemLabs may also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information.
All product purchases are handled by third party resellers which do not share any financial information with iChemLabs.
Other types of information from our products may also be saved on our servers, including, but not limited to, saves and assignments. This is done to better the ease and transfer of data between a user and his/her various computers, and others he/she wishes to share with.
Some of our products require activation after purchase. iChemLabs does not collect any information during activation other than that necessary to generate unique license keys and to provide better support.
Use of Data
Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site. Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made available to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on our site requires interaction with a third party or is provided by a third party, such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this site violates this policy, terms of service, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary to protect iChemLabs' legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this Policy. In the event you choose to use links that appear on this web site to visit other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites.
Information voluntarily provided by a user of iChemLabs website, products, or services including name and institution in product testimonials may be used by iChemLabs for marketing purposes.
Cookies
Like many web sites, this web site sets and uses cookies to enhance your user experience, such as retaining your personal settings. We do not employ web advertising on this website and no companies currently advertise on our site.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Changes may be made to this policy from time to time. You will be notified of substantial changes to this policy through the posting of a prominent announcement on the site.
NO GUARANTEES
While this privacy policy states standards for maintenance of data, and while efforts will be made to meet the said standards, iChemLabs is not in a position to guarantee compliance with these standards. There may be factors beyond iChemLabs' control that may result in disclosure of data. Consequently, iChemLabs offers no warranties or representations as regards maintenance or nondisclosure of data.
