A list of Ofcom's policies and guidelines.
Approach to the coronavirus (Covid-19)
This is an unprecedented time for our country, and keeping communications going across the UK has never been more important. Over the next few months Ofcom’s sectors will play a vital role in supporting families, businesses and individuals as we all adapt the way we live, work and communicate in the wake of the coronavirus.See more about what this means for our areas of work.Ofcom has also published a statement on Royal Mail’s decision to temporarily suspend Saturday letters delivery, as a result of the pandemic.Ofcom wrote to telecoms providers (PDF, 152.4 KB) in November 2020 to ensure there is continued support for consumers struggling to pay their bills at a time of increased reliance on telecoms services.

Better policy making: Ofcom's approach to impact assessment
The decisions which Ofcom makes can impose significant costs on our stakeholders and it is important for us to think very carefully before adding to the burden of regulation. One of our key regulatory principles is that we have a bias against intervention. This means that a high hurdle must be overcome before we regulate. If intervention is justified, we aim to choose the least intrusive means of achieving our objectives, recognising the potential for regulation to reduce competition. These guidelines explain how Impact Assessments will be used to help us apply these principles in a transparent and justifiable way."The option of not intervening...should always be seriously considered. Sometimes the fact that a market is working imperfectly is used to justify taking action. But no market ever works perfectly, while the effects of...regulation and its unintended consequences, may be worse then the effects of the imperfect market" - Better Regulation Task Force (September 2003)Better Policy Making - Ofcom's approach to Impact Assessment (PDF, 79.2 KB)
Business Impact Target
Under the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (‘the SBEE Act’), we have a statutory obligation to produce an assessment of the economic impact on business of every qualifying regulatory provision we make during the relevant period. A qualifying regulatory provision is one that does not fall under any of the exclusions prescribed in the SBEE Act.See more about Ofcom's Business Impact Target.
Carbon audit results
Ofcom carried out an initial carbon audit in 2007 and subsequently committed to a challenging 25% reduction in carbon emissions by 2013. Over the past few years, Ofcom has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce emissions as part of its Footprint and Sustainability project.Ofcom has conducted a number of subsequent audits to assess progress against this overall reduction target. An audit in 2009 confirmed a total footprint of 4,716 tonnes compared to a 5,525 tonne baseline, equating to a 15% reduction in emissions. A further audit in 2011 confirmed a total footprint of 4,367 tonnes, bringing the overall reduction to 21%.Ofcom's latest audit in 2013 confirmed a total footprint of 3,878 tonnes. This represents a 1,647 tonne reduction compared to the baseline, equating to an overall reduction of 30% and exceeding our original reduction target. The full carbon audit can be found below. We will continue to monitor our internal KPIs in order to reduce our emissions further in subsequent years.Note that the original carbon audit showed a baseline footprint of 6,402 tonnes, however this was retrospectively updated by the carbon auditors in 2009 to account for revised carbon methodology, changes in conversion factors to align with Defra updates and minor changes to base-year input data.OFCOM Final report Carbon Audit 2013 (PDF, 1.4 MB)

Policy on pre-disclosure of documents
Ofcom will generally not pre-disclose its documents to stakeholders ahead of publication. For further information contact the Ofcom analyst relations manager.
Procedure for making a disclosure to Ofcom under the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA)
The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 ('PIDA'/'Act') came into effect on 1 January 1999. The Act gives legal protection to employees against being dismissed or penalised by their employers as a result of disclosing information which is considered to be in the public interest. The principle of the Act is that where an individual discovers information which he or she believes to show malpractice or wrongdoing within their organisation that this information should be disclosed without fear of reprisal. This should be facilitated by a process which ensures that the person making the disclosure is afforded proper protection and that the information is acted upon quickly. The Act offers a right to redress in the event of victimisation if individuals raise concerns in the ways specified by the legislation.Ofcom has a policy in place for its own employees and is obliged (it is a 'prescribed person') under the Act to put in place a procedure under which individuals working outside Ofcom but in the communications sector may contact Ofcom if they have concerns about possible wrongdoing at their own organisation and where they have been unable to raise or resolve those concerns internally. Ofcom is a Prescribed Person under the Act to which external disclosures can be made on matters relating to:"(a) the provision of electronic communications networks and services and the use of the electro-magnetic spectrum; (b) broadcasting and the provision of television and radio services; (c) media ownership and control; and (d) competition in communications markets."Procedure for making a disclosure to Ofcom under the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA).

Simplification plan: 2007
Ofcom is committed to reducing regulation and minimising administrative burdens on its stakeholders. We have a bias against regulatory intervention and, where we do need to intervene, we seek to use the least intrusive mechanisms. We also recognise the importance of keeping under review, and minimising, the burdens imposed by existing regulation. A key part of this is ensuring that our operational processes are efficient and user friendly.This Simplification Plan sets out what Ofcom has done to reduce regulation since publishing our last Simplification Plan in December 2006, and outlines the further initiatives we will be taking over the coming year. For the purpose of consistency, any reference to "simplification initiatives" includes initiatives that are aimed at reducing regulatory burdens on our stakeholders, including administrative burdens associated with regulatory compliance.Simplification plan: 2007 (PDF, 195.5 KB)
