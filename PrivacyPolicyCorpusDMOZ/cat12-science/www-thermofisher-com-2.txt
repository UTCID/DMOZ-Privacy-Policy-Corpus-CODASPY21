The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires us to provide additional privacy-related information to residents of California, effective January 1, 2020.
a. California Residents’ Privacy Rights
Under the conditions set out under the CCPA, California residents have rights under Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110, 1798.115 and 1798.125, including to:
(i) Request access to copies of their personal information;
(ii) Request access to information about what categories of personal information we have collected from them, the categories of sources of such information, the purposes for which we collect their personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we have shared their personal information, and the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about them for a business purpose;

(v) Be notified of any financial incentives offered to them in exchange for any right we wish to have to collect, sell or delete their personal information.
Not all California residents may exercise all of the above rights in all circumstances. For example, the CCPA currently does not establish the above rights (with the exception of the right described in bullet (d) above) with respect to personal information reflecting a written or verbal communication or a transaction between a California resident and us where the California resident acts as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company or other entity and the communication or transaction with us occurs solely within the context of us conducting due diligence regarding, or providing or receiving a product or service to or from such entity.
Californian residents may submit a request to exercise their rights under the CCPA by emailing us at data.privacy@thermofisher.com.
