New Vierteljahrshefte zur Wirtschaftsforschung (Quarterly Journal of Economic Research) about Development Banks online
The new Vierteljahrshefte zur Wirtschaftsforschung 2/2020 contain seven articles on the topic of development banks and why these are not only of great importance in the corona crisis.
The Covid-19 pandemic is hitting, directly and indirectly, economies throughout the world. While the pandemic is far from over, countries are searching for ways to enhance a quick recovery of their economies. Among others, ...

More than ten years after the outbreak of the great financial crisis and almost ten years since the beginning of the European sovereignty debt crisis, there are not just questions about the opportunities and risks of debt but ...

A proposal for a Covid Credit Line
It is in the interest of every EU member state that countries in the Union hit by the coronavirus are able to take the necessary measures to control the pandemic and deal with the economic consequences without being constrained, and to do so very quickly. This column proposes a Covid credit line in the European Stability Mechanism, with allocation across member states proportionate to the severity ...

Call for Papers: Determinants of Non-cash payments and alternative money
