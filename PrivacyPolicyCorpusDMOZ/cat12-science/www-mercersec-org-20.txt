The fair is open to all students that attend school in Mercer County, NJ. There is no charge to participate because of our sponsors. They cover the cost of running the fair including affiliation with the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and the Broadcom Masters Competition as well as covering the cost for awards.
The more funds we raise each year the more awards we can provide. For example, we normally send the grand prize winner of the Senior division to compete at ISEF. For the past few years we have had enough sponsors to send two students to compete at ISEF.
