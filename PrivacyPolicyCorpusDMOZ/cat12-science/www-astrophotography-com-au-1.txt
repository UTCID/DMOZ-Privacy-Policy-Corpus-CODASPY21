About Started by Roger Groom in 2003 Astro Photography Australia sells prints, copyright use, acrylic photo blocks and mugs of astrophotography. Every print is high quality made to last, making great gifts.
Stock Availability Stock quantities are shown for products, I attempt to keep these as up to date. Many 5x7, 12x8 and 50x33 prints are in stock all the time and ship within two business days. I tend to produce larger prints on-demand requiring a lead time of one to two weeks. Astro Mugs and Acrylic Photo Blocks stock quantities on the website are accurate, those not in stock require a two week lead time. If timing is critical for your order please contact me first to check stock on hand.
