Cyber attacks come in third place when the World Economic Forum lists the biggest threats against humanity in the next five years. There are also reports showing large shortcomings in the society's abilities in managing and handling these threats. In our Master Programme for Privacy, Information Security and Cyber Security you will learn to develop, shape and become an integral part of the digital society of the future, where information security and privacy is in the forefront.
About the programme
Our entire modern society relies on digital information. Corporations and governments are handling more information than ever before. A society with an increasing share of electronic information is completely dependent on systematic information security management focusing on the information itself as well as a reliable infrastructure. Changes in the society put demands on IT-security and data protection. Our personal integrity is threatened when services are personalised and all digital activities are registered and analysed. Information and cyber security has become an important requirement in order to face the increased online threats. Increased access to large amounts of information means that the right to privacy can be compromised or used for identity theft, among other things. Therefore, there is a need to protect personal as well as organisational information.

The focus of your studies
The programme offers comprehensive studies in privacy, information security and cyber security, providing you with unique skills. During the courses of the programme, you will learn how a systematic approach to information security can be implemented in an organisation through various management systems. You will also learn about data protection, methods for discovering and stopping data packages containing damaging files and the management of security risks in common solutions for the Internet of Things. The programme is concluded with a master thesis.
A majority of the teachers in the programme have experience in privacy, information and cyber security research and are working on ground-breaking projects so that students are exposed to the latest trends in this important and exciting area.
The programme is built on interactive lectures, seminars and assignments and students are expected to participate during the scheduled sessions. There are several mandatory seminars throughout the programme. We offer the programme on campus and online, but all sessions are combining online and campus students. Thus, to be successful in your studies it is important that you are able to attend the lectures, seminars and other sessions live as no sessions will be recorded. We made an active decision to use this approach because we believe that the subject is best explored in dialogue and we do not attempt to offer a self-paced study programme.
Upon completion of your studies
Digitalisation affects all regions, sectors and businesses in a society. The risk of cyber attacks and data breaches has increased with the increase of electronic management. Today, there is a demand for people with skills in the areas of privacy, information security and cyber security. This need is foreseeable for many years ahead.
Upon obtaining you degree, you will also be eligible for post graduate studies in Informatics.
The program leads to a 120 credits masters degree in informatics. During year one, students may opt to write a thesis project for a 60 credits masters degree and subsequently apply for a 60 credits masters degree.
