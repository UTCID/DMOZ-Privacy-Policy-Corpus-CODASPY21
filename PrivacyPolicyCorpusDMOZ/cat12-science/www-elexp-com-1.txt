Privacy and Security Policy
Privacy and Security Policy
Electronix Express respects your privacy and guards your data carefully. We do not share, disclose or sell any personal information collected online with other companies or organizations. The information that you submit to us is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information.
Please be advised that we use analytics software to track user behavior on our website. All IP addresses will be anonymized and never used in conjuction with specific user information.
When you proceed to the online checkout, your browser will automatically be switched to our secure server. This can be verified by the "https" displayed in your browsers address field. Most browsers will also display a 'padlock' symbol at the bottom of the browser window. Your credit card information is being protected by being encrypted. If any other internet user intercepts the communication he/she will only be able to see it in an encrypted (garbled) form.
Security measures continue even after you've placed your order. We only decrypt your information after it is placed on a computer not connected to the Internet. Once we process the order here at Electronix Express, we do not keep your credit card number on file. You will be asked to give us new credit card information each time you order. Although this may be a minor inconvenience, we believe that this provides better security.
Other Types of Information
Electronix Express collects your name, address, telephone number, fax number and email address when you fill out one of our forms or place an order. We need this information for the following reasons:
To email you a Customer Receipt to you of your order (this receipt never includes your credit card number)
To send you requested information such as our catalog or newsletter
To inform you of special offers, updated information and new services.
To contact you when you have received an error while using our website so we can help you solve the problem.
Whenever we obtain this type of information, we use all reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that email going through regular channels such as our catalog request form, our newsletter request form and the Customer Receipt for your order which is automatically generated by our shopping cart (which, as we mentioned above, never includes your credit card number), are absolutely safe from hackers. Accordingly, we can assume no liability for any disclosure of this type of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.
Choice/Opt-out
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing electron@elexp.com
