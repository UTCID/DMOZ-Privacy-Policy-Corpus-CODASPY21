• Direct marketing;
• Member and customer data analysis;
• Development of directories; and
• Product and services customization and development.
LEGAL BASIS FOR COLLECTING AND PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA

SAFEGUARDS
The Society has put in place reasonable technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect personal data collected by the Society.
