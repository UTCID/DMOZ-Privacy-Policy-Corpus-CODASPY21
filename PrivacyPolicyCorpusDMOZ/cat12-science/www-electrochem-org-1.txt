Click-Stream Data
A visit to one of our websites results in data that is transmitted from your browser to our server being automatically collected and stored by us or by third parties on behalf of us. This data can include, in particular, the following:
The visitor’s IP address
The date and time of the visit
The referral URL (the site from which the visitor has come)
The pages visited on our website
Information about the browser used (browser type and version, operating system, etc.)
How We Collect Personal Data
In general, a visitor will know when Personal Data is being collected because he or she will have to fill out an online form, complete a survey or application, or reply to an email, for example. In addition, we may collect Personal Data through your use of the website(s) and apps.
Visitors may generally browse public portions of the ECS website anonymously without providing any Personal Data. However, Personal Data is required in connection with registering with one or more of the sites mentioned above. In addition, Personal Data will be requested in connection with the following:
Account creation
Membership join, rejoin, or renew process
Submission of a manuscript or technical content to ECS publications

Submission of an online content form
Mailing list sign-up
Submission of a survey or evaluation form
Online purchases such as meeting/event and publications products
As ECS utilizes multiple platforms to conduct business, ECS will also import user information from various systems to ensure all data is centralized to the main Association Management System (AMS).
ECS does not knowingly collect or use any Personal Data from users under 13 years of age.
How We May Use Your Personal Data
We use your Personal Data to provide you with personalized service; send targeted communications and email alerts, answer your requests, process your requested services (i.e., membership, meetings/events, online purchases, content access, abstract or manuscript submission), track your engagement, etc. We may also use your information to track visits to our website. This lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users’ needs. It also allows us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties.
Personal Data may be shared with editors, editorial staff, and others that participate in the peer review and content development process. If a meeting abstract or manuscript submission is accepted for publication, Personal Data is also shared with IOP Publishing and external vendors such as publishers, printers, and hosting companies to facilitate the publication process.

The “cookie” is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our website. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you’re particularly interested in. They also let us track your usage of ECS websites, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular.
If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address, and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
ECS encourages you to be aware that when you go to another website, you should carefully read its privacy policy.

Personal Data used in relationship to a manuscript submission, peer review, or publication are stored indefinitely in order to address future ethics concerns or violations.
Our Security Measures to Protect Your Personal Data

We restrict access to Personal Data to our employees, volunteers, contractors, and vendors who need to know the information to operate, develop, or improve our services.
Unfortunately, no transmission of Personal Data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, ECS cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online services. ECS has no responsibility or liability for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the security of your Personal Data, please contact us as indicated under the “Contact Us” section below.
