Infrastructure is crucial for Australia. It underpins productivity growth, supports a growing population, sustains industry growth, boosts competitiveness, enhances societal wellbeing and connects rural and urban environments.
Improving investment in, and the delivery of, infrastructure makes the economy more effective for society and more attractive to foreign investors.
But achieving sound infrastructure requires high-quality planning, design, financing, delivery and management.
