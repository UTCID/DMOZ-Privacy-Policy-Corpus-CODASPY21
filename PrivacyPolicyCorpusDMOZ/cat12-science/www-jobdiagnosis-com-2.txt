Without limiting any indemnification provision of this Agreement, You (the "Indemnitor") agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Job Diagnosis and the Job Diagnosis Parties (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, causes of action, and other proceedings (individually, "Claim," and collectively, "Claims"), including but not limited to legal costs and fees, and providing sole and exclusive control of the defense of any action to Job Diagnosis, including the choice of legal counsel and all related settlement negotiations, arising out of or relating to: (i) the relationship between You and Job Diagnosis, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; (ii) Your breach of this Agreement, including without limitation any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement; (iii) Your access to or use of the Service; (iv) Your provision to Job Diagnosis or any of the Indemnitees of information or other data; or (v) Your violation or alleged violation of any foreign or domestic, international, federal, state, or local law or regulation; or (vi) Your violation or alleged violation of any third party's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights.
The Indemnitees each have the individual right, but not the obligation, to participate through counsel of their choice in any defense by You of any Claim as to which You are required to defend, indemnify, or hold harmless any, each, and/or all Indemnitees.
You may not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the concerned Indemnified Parties.
26. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE
(a)
1-Year Limitations Period
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE, OR THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE INSTITUTED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER WAIVED AND BARRED.
ALL ACTIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN ABOVE.
(b)
Binding Arbitration
If You and Job Diagnosis cannot resolve a Claim through negotiations, either party may elect to have the Claim finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).
YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT WITH A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, Job Diagnosis will pay the AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedures 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, You hereby agree to reimburse Job Diagnosis for all payments disbursed that are your obligation to reimbursed under the AAA Rules.
If you are unable to pay the arbitration fee, Job Diagnosis will pay it directly upon receiving a written request and a sworn statement that you are unable to pay.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to resolve, except that issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration provision for a Court of Competent Jurisdiction to resolve.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through document submission, through telephone, or online.
The arbitrator will issue a decision in writing, but need only provide a statement of reasons if requested by a party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Job Diagnosis may litigate to compel arbitration in court, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
(c)
Restrictions Against Joinder of Claims
You and Job Diagnosis agree that any arbitration shall be limited to each Claim individually.
YOU AND JOB DIAGNOSIS HEREBY AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR JOB DIAGNOSIS'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
In the event that this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, the Claim will still be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration upon the election of either party, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).
In addition: (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration, and (2) there is no right for any Claim to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to employ class action procedures, and (3) there is no right of authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf either of the general public or any other individuals.
(d)
Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief
This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or Job Diagnosis from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.
Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or Job Diagnosis from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary. As used herein, "Court of Competent Jurisdiction" means any federal or state court: (1) that has jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (2) that is located in the State of California.
(e)
Laws of the State of California
This Agreement, including without limitation this Agreement's interpretation, shall be treated as though this Agreement were executed and performed in the State of California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law principles. The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party.
THE PROPER VENUE FOR ANY JUDICIAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN TO SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, OR THE PROPER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED NEAREST TO SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY.
THE PARTIES HEREBY STIPULATE TO, AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO, THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS, AND FURTHER EXPRESSLY SUBMIT TO EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE OF PROCESS.

30. GENERAL

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Job Diagnosis or by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by Job Diagnosis and by the posting by Job Diagnosis of such amended version.
A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of Job Diagnosis.
