Privacy & Terms of Use
Privacy Policy for Symbiote
Symbiote is committed to protecting your privacy. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This notice applies only to the information collected on this website or sales portal, and does not apply to any other information Symbiote collects about you in other forums, such as trade shows, through a standard mailing or over the phone. As content changes our information collection practices may change as well. Such changes may necessitate updates to this privacy policy. We encourage you to return to this page periodically to check for updates.
How and What We Collect
We have several information collection areas on our site, from the Contact Us page to the Request a Quote form. Information is collected to respond to your request, which typically includes an email address, first and last name, address, telephone number, title and corporate affiliation. On each collection area, we indicate what information is required in order for us to process your request. Like most websites, we collect some passive information from visitors to maintain our site and determine what areas are more popular than others. The tracking mechanisms compile statistics that show, for example, the daily number of visitors to our site and this is used internally to better design our site.
How Your Information Is Used
We use the information you provide to respond to a particular request; for example, to send literature you requested. We also use your contact information to tell you about products, services or events which we believe you may be interested in. We will also disclose your information if required by law to do so.
The Choices You have About Our Use of Your Information and How to Contact Us
If you submitted information to us in an online form, please contact us at symbiote@symbiote.com to update your information. In general, we presume that by providing your information on this site, you are doing so because you wish to receive information from Symbiote for products or services you may be interested in. However, if this is not the case, and you do not wish to receive information from us, email symbiote@symbiote.com. In some cases, when registering for an event, we may ask if you would like further information sent to you. If you choose "Yes," you are giving us permission to send you notifications of events and updates. We provide you with the ability to contact us about standard questions you may have at the "Contact Us" area of our site. If you have any questions that do not fall into one of the categories or have other questions, please write to Symbiote, Inc., 300 North Centennial Street, Zeeland MI 49464 or call 1-800-283-2434.
How We Maintain the Security of Your Information
We use standard industry practices, including storage of data in password protected files, to maintain the security and integrity of your information. We collect information over a secure Internet connection. In addition, once received, only employees who need to view your information have access to these files. Please remember that, ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information.
