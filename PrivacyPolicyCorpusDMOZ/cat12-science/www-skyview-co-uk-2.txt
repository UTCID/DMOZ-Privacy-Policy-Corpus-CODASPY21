What are cookies?
A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your computer or device when you visit certain websites. Our website is powered by Shopify and Shopify use a number of different cookies on this website, that may include strictly necessary, performance, advertising, and social media or content cookies. Cookies make your browsing experience better by allowing the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login and region selection). This means you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you return to the site or browse from one page to another. Cookies also provide information on how people use the website, for instance whether it’s their first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor. Read more about cookies (and other similar tracking technologies) and how Shopify use the data collected through these technologies, in their Privacy Policy.
What cookies do Shopify use and why?
Some cookies are necessary to allow you to browse this website, use its features, and access secure areas. The use of these cookies is essential for the website to work. For example, Shopify use user-input cookies for the duration of a session to keep track of a user’s input when filling in forms that span several pages.
Shopify also use functional cookies to remember choices you’ve made or information you’ve provided, such as your username, language, or the region you are in. This allows them to tailor your website experience specifically to your preferences. For example, authentication cookies are functional cookies that are used for the duration of a session (or persistent, if you agree to the “remember me” function) to allow users to authenticate themselves on subsequent visits or to gain access to authorised content across pages. The functional cookies that may be used include:
User-centric security cookies to detect authentication abuses for a limited persistent duration, like repeated failed login attempts. These cookies are set for the specific task of increasing the security of the service.
Multimedia content player session cookies (flash cookies) are used for the duration of a session to store technical data needed to play back video or audio content (e.g. image quality, network link speed, and buffering parameters).
Load balancing session cookies are used for the duration of the session to identify the same server in the pool in order for the load balancer to redirect user requests appropriately.
User interface customization persistent cookies are used to store a user’s preference regarding a service across web pages.
Shopify is dedicated to user experience and they use many tools to help them improve this website and their commerce platform. To this end, they use reporting and analytics cookies to collect information about how you use this website, and how often. These cookies only gather information for statistical purposes and only use pseudonymous cookie identifiers that do not directly identify you. The performance cookies that may be used include:
First party analytics cookies - used to estimate the number of unique visitors, to improve this website, and to detect the most searched for words in search engines that lead to a webpage. These cookies are not used to target you with online marketing. These cookies are used to help us and Shopify know how this website is performing and make relevant improvements to improve your browsing experience.
Third party analytics cookies - Google Analytics and other third-party analytics providers listed below used to help measure how users interact with this website's content. These cookies “remember” what users have done on previous pages and how they’ve interacted with the website. For more information on Google Analytics, visit Google’s information page. For instructions on how opt out of Google Analytics, see below.
Advertising cookies may be used on this website to tailor marketing to you and your interests and provide you with a more personalised service in the future. These cookies remember that you visited this website and this information may be shared with third-parties, such as advertisers. Although these cookies can track your device’s visits to this website and other sites, they typically cannot personally identify you. Without these cookies, the advertisements that you see may be less relevant and interesting to you. Read more about how companies use cookies to conduct targeted or retargeted advertising here.
Finally, Social and Content cookies are placed by many social media plugins (for example the Facebook ’like’ button), and other tools meant to provide or improve the content on a website (for example services that allow the playing of video files, or that create comments sections). Shopify integrate these modules into their platform to improve the experience of browsing and interacting with this website. Please note that some of these third party services place cookies that are also used for things like behavioural advertising, analytics, and/or market research.

How long will cookies remain on my computer or mobile device?
The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies Shopify use are persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device. See the section below on how to control cookies for more information on removing them before they expire.
How to control cookies?
You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose whether or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in your browser’s “Tools” or “Preferences” menu. For more information on how to modify your browser settings or how to block, manage or filter cookies can be found in your browser’s help file or through such sites as: www.allaboutcookies.org.
