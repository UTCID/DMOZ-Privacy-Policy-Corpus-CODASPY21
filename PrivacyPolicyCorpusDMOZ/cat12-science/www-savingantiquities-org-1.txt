6. RESTRICTIONS AND ADVICE CONCERNING THE INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON THE WEBSITE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. When you elect to access and use the Web site, or when you elect to register as a member of SAFE by accessing the Web site, or when you elect to upload Content or communicate with SAFE or its members of users by means of the Web site, you acknowledge that in using SAFE services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, uploading photos and files to SAFE, transmission of emails, personal and financial identifiers and data, and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through SAFE’s computer networks, portions of which are located in the State of New York and other locations in the United States. As a result, and also as a result of SAFE’s network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to the TCU, you acknowledge that use of the Web site results in interstate data transmissions. Furthermore, the Web site will allow you and the people with whom you communicate to save your and their contributions, comments and/or conversations on the Web site. This means you can access and search your past contributions, comments and/or conversations from any computer with access to the Internet. Whether or not you use this feature, other users may choose to use it to consult your past or present contributions, comments and conversations. Your agreement to this TCU constitutes your consent to allow SAFE to store these communications on its servers. From time to time SAFE may make important changes with respect to the feature described in this section and amend this TCU to communicate those changes. It is your duty to periodically review the TCU, as it may be amended from time to time, to look for any such changes. You may also receive such messages by email. Such messages may not be received if you violate the TCU. Your agreement to this TCU constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Web site in an authorized manner. The Web site is operated by SAFE from its offices within the State of New York. SAFE makes no representation that Content on the Web site is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access the Web site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for establishing the usability or correctness of any information or Content under any or all jurisdictions and the compliance of that information or Content with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. For additional important information, see Section 25 of this TCU.
7. RESTRICTIONS AND ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO ACCESS THE SAFE WEBSITE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
8. CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE SAFE WEBSITE.

The license referenced in the preceding sentence shall be perpetual, fully sublicensable, irrevocable by you, and shall terminate at the time SAFE removes such Content from the Web site, unless such Content is subject to a separate written agreement with SAFE; and (ii) With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Web site, the perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable license referenced in subsection (i) of this section entitles SAFE to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed, unless such Content is subject to a separate written agreement with SAFE.

26. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS. Any failure of SAFE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TCU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TCU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TCU remain in full force and effect.
