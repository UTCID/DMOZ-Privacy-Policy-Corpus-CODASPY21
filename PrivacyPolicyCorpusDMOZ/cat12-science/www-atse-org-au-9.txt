The scientific evidence for global warming is unequivocal. To avoid the widespread and dangerous impacts of climate change, strong action is required by policy-makers and industry.
Mitigation responses are critical to reduce the rate of warming. Adaptation responses are necessary to reduce the impact of climate-related challenges.
We believe that Australia’s mitigation and adaptation efforts will be strongly enhanced by the adoption and extension of technological and scientific innovation, supported by government policy that encourages investment in technologies already available.
