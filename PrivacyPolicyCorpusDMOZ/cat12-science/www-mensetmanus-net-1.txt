Common sense isn't.
Privacy Policy - Mens et Manus Toe-Hold on the Net
Are we Free to travel (privately)?
I respect your privacy, but can't do much about
protecting it, other than my small part.
As for the Google logo, their standard setup uses a link to a
logo file on Google's server. The same is true for some other
logos. (Whether intentionally or not) This way they log a file
request, including Referer page, every time someone views a page
with their logo on it. This way they can track activity of many
sites other than their own. I store logos locally, or don't use logos
at all, and change the
links, to avoid that tracking. Of course if you actually use the
Google search, or follow my off-site links, then they will follow
your comings and goings at their sites (a small price for
searching, etc.). I initially signed up for Google's affiliate
program to get a penny per search, but I decided the obligation to
cooperate with their (potential) tracking was not worth it. I
decided to go with the free search link with the logo modification
described above.
I signed up for Amazon referral links, but those only track you
if you follow them (like any other off-site links).
Visits are logged by my web host's servers to
monitor site activity in a general way. Although the log contains
IP addresses, I make no attempt to match the address to any
particular individual, except on very rare occasions (There's
always an exception to the general rule) such as abuse of our site.
The bulletin board script
does use cookies, but I make no attempt to use cookies for any
other purpose than for board function (login, etc.).
I have no intention of ever sharing any collected information
with anyone for anything. I also have no intention of ever sending
unsolicited mass email (spam) to anyone about anything. That said,
I have no control over several things, which could possibly affect
your privacy. My logs are controlled by, protected by, and
available to my web host's company. I think they'll protect the
information, but it's beyond my control.
If you have concerns over your privacy, it's up to you to find
and use an
anonymizer or a proxy server, or other means.
Freedom.net
(firewall, banner removal, cookie jar, and form filler,
pseudo-nym and encrypted email and anonymous
browsing with premium version)
is no more.
I also recommend PGP encrypted email.
You could also try one of many VPN services.
Here's a rating site (no endorsement).
As they say, use at your own risk.
