Delivery
Delivery is in accordance with the product availablility. The quoted shipping times quoted at Checkout are based on stock availability. Where items are out-of-stock, an expected delivery time is quoted based on historical delivery times from our suppliers. Should there be an issue with quoted delivery time, Jaytee Biosciences Ltd will contact you.
Customs
When ordering products for delivery outside of the UK, you may incur import taxes and duties. These are levied when the package reaches your specified delivery address. You must pay any additional charges for customs clearance.
Please also note that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.
Refund / Replacement of Faulty Goods
If goods fail to meet the product specifications as described in the warranty, or performance when used in the recommended way, then you are entitled to replacement goods or a refund where appropriate. Jaytee Biosciences Ltd reserves the right to establish the cause of failure and proper use prior to refunds or returns being agreed. Please contact us before returning items so that we can ascertain the condition of the item and how best to ship to our premises.
Replacement Goods
Where Jaytee are required to provide a replacement part, our policy is to immediately assess the status of the item on arrival (our Goods In accepts deliveries between 8.30am and 5.30pm, UK time Monday – Friday excluding Bank Holidays). A replacement will be sent to you by the next working day at the latest if in stock. In circumstances where Jaytee is out of stock, items will be ordered from our suppliers the next working day at the latest and we will communicate timescales to you as appropriate.
Returns / Cancellations
We accept returns and cancellation of goods up to 14 days after you receive them, in line with the Consumer Contracts Regulations (UK). Some items we supply will have an OEM seal, and these items can only be returned where the seal remains unbroken. Please contact us in this event before returning, as the item may NOT be eligible for a refund.
When returning goods within the 14 day period, please use our Cancellation Form and follow the instructions that outline the cancellation process.
Jaytee Biosciences Ltd will only incur the cost of carriage where the item is proven to be faulty (see above).
