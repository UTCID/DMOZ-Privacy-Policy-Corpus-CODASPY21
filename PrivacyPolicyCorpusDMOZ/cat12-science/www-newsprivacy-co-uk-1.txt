HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR LEGAL BASES FOR THESE USES
WITH YOUR CONSENT
There may be some uses of your information where we need to ask for your consent. You will have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, however, if you withdraw consent, we may not be able to provide the product or service you have requested. We will rely on your consent to:

This may also include sending you information and updates relating to the products and services we provide to you.

It may also be used to verify credit details related to payments. Payment details may be retained in order to speed up the renewal process for products and services.
If you apply for credit, then in order to help us make credit decisions about you we may check with credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your credit file. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account with us to these credit reference agencies for related purposes.
FOR A LEGITIMATE INTEREST
We may use your information where there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as where it would help achieve our business objectives or to facilitate a benefit to you or someone else.
Our legitimate interests in processing personal data include:
to support a free press, including journalistic activities of societal importance;
to support individual and societal rights to receive information;
to develop, deliver and maintain relevant and engaging products services and advertising;
understanding when our audiences engage with us or other organisations;
to build a clearer understanding of who our audiences are in order to better serve them;
to carry on the business of a commercial organisation; and
to demonstrate that we provide services and products to agreed industry standards.
We rely on these legitimate interests to:
Monitor, improve and protect our products, content, services and websites, online and offline: This includes using information about your app download to validate free trials.
Personalise your experience: We sometimes make assumptions about your interests and preferences based on the way you interact with our products and services and the information we hold about you.
Knowing these interests and preferences allows us to understand the products, content and services our customers like, letting us focus our efforts on developing those areas. We may also use this information to make decisions about what direct marketing and advertising to show you.
Content recommendations We may also use your information to optimise article and content recommendations. Based on the kind of articles and content which prove to be of interest to you.
To build and manage direct marketing campaigns: We use your information to create engaging and relevant marketing campaigns promoting products and services we think you will like from our brands and partners. The use of your information to do this is usually based on a legitimate interest, however, we will ask your permission if we want to deliver direct marketing to you. You will be able to change your marketing preferences in your Preference Centre or in the communications you are sent.
To send product related and similar product and services communications:
for certain types of marketing communications, we do not require your consent and we instead rely on our legitimate interest. This is the case for example where we send you postal advertising or where we send you ‘in-life’ communications about products or services that we provide to you. You can opt out of these communications either by visiting your preference centre if you have an account or in the communication itself.
We may send you service-related messages, which are about the service we provide. We do not require your consent for these, and you are not able to opt out.
Prevent fraud, check your identity, and prevent money laundering: We may use your information to check your identity in relation to requests you make. We may also have a legal obligation requiring us to carry out this activity.
Facilitate posting, commenting and interaction: If you correspond with any of our titles or radio stations, or interact with other customers or audience members or our staff, for example by using polls, comments, text messages, video, email, phone, radio or by post, we may display this content indefinitely in any relevant context, subject to our editorial judgement and your rights as set out in this Policy. This may be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer service conversations. If you take part in any reader or listener forums, send us letters for publication, or take part in any radio 'phone-ins', then you may be identifiable to others publicly and your comments attributed to you.
Deliver relevant advertising: We may use the information we hold about you to help us and our partners make better decisions about what adverts to present to you. We also use the information we collect from you and other sources to create engaging and relevant marketing campaigns promoting products and services we think you will like from our brands and partners.
When you visit our websites or use our apps, advertising networks and other intermediaries that we work with may select and then display adverts on your device. In the case of some of our digital radio stations, when listening online, we and our partners may insert a relevant audio advert for you to listen to.
Audience segmentation and creation: we may use the information we hold about you, including how you engage with our products and services, as well as from other sources, to segment our audiences into groups with particular attributes (likes/dislikes/reading behaviours etc). This helps us personalise your experience and show you more relevant content and adverts.
Cookie matching/syncing: When you visit our sites, we may check your device to see if a cookie ID has been assigned to it. This is a form of identifier that tells us who is visiting our sites. We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have for you with IDs that our advertisers hold to see if we both know who you are. By knowing it is you (or your device), the advertiser can decide if they want to advertise to you and if so, what advertising would be relevant. See the section on Cookies & Similar Technologies for more information.
Data matching: From time to time we may allow our clients to compare their customer database to ours. This is called data matching and allows our partners to see if they can reach their audiences on our platforms. Generally this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client and other information that would be useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.
As part of the data matching process we may allow partners to build target audiences based on pre-defined attributes. These ‘lookalike’ audiences may be similar to our partners’ existing audiences. For example, a sports brand may want to reach ‘sports enthusiasts’ or those who enjoy ‘outdoor pursuits’. They could select audiences who have been identified as having an interest in these areas. To do this, we segment our audiences into groups depending on what we think they like or other behaviours. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.
Detect ad blockers: We may collect information from your devices that tells us whether you are using an ad blocker. This is so that we can manage our compliance with the law and also determine if we are able to show you advertising. We may also ask you to suspend or whitelist our sites so that we can show you adverts. As a predominantly advertising funded business, we do rely on our ability to show you advertising to help ensure we are able to provide you with the products and services you request.
Provide co-branded services and features: We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions, together with a third party and may share the information you provide to us with that third party. These co-branded services may be hosted by us or by the third party. It will usually be obvious where this is the case and will provide you with additional information where required. Please remember that where we share your information with these third parties, that they will use your information in accordance with their privacy policy.
Ensure our services are used appropriately: If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to our websites or apps, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our platforms, we may use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties, including your employer, law enforcement or other competent authorities about the content and your behaviour.
Ensure that our products and services confirm to agreed industry standards: Some of our products and services are independently monitored and assessed to ensure they meet approved industry standards and for industry reporting purposes.
Provide you with support: We may also provide you with help and support where we believe it is required. For example, if you have provided your contact information, we may contact you when a checkout journey is not completed. We may record phone calls or customer enquiries via online chat for quality, training and management purposes.
Conduct market research and analytics: We may use the information we hold on you about your engagement with our products and services, as well as other information collected from partners and other sources, to understand how our products are used and make improvements or develop other products and services our audiences may like. We may to contact you about your experience of a product or service we provide you.

Ipsos MORI, a specialist research agency will be carrying out this research, in conjunction with UKOM, the UK Online Measurement company and DotMetrics. To contact Ipsos MORI about this specific research, please email: compliance@ipsosiris.com

CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS & CHOICES
California Consumers may have certain rights in connection with the personal information we collect about you, many of which are subject to exceptions under applicable law:
The right to access and disclosure - You may have the right to request, twice during a twelve month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:
the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;
the business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information;
the categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information; and
the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or disclosed that information for a business purpose.
The right to deletion - you may have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR ACCESS AND DELETION RIGHTS
California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting a request via our online portal or by sending an email to dataprotection@news.co.uk with 'CCPA' in the subject line. For security purposes, we will verify your identity - in part by asking you to verify your email address and requesting certain information from you, when you request to exercise your California privacy rights, such as address and photographic ID.
To request that we provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we have from you or to delete personal information we have collected from you, we may also need to ask you for additional information to verify your identity.
Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will comply with your request, unless an exemption applies.
Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CCPA. For instance, we may not disclose financial account numbers as such disclosure may create an unreasonable risk to your personal information, your account with us, or our business systems.
Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, unless an exemption applies we will de-identify personal information about you that is not necessary for the purposes indicated above. Upon completion, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information we were able to locate about you, whether we (1) deleted, (2) de-identified, (3) aggregated or (4) retained the information we collected from you.
If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.
The right to non-discrimination - we will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.
The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. You have the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information. California law broadly defines sale such that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies IP address and/or browsing behaviour, to deliver targeted advertising.
If you would like to opt out, you may do so by visiting the Do Not Sell My Personal Information link on the website that you wish to opt out of.
Authorised Agents
You may designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorised to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorisation or a copy of a power of attorney.
How to contact us
If you are a California Consumer, please contact us at dataprotection@news.co.uk. To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
Cookies & Similar Technologies
What are cookies
Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small bits of data or code that are used to identify your devices when you use and interact with our websites and other services. They are often used for remembering your preferences, to identify popular news stories, to remember you're logged in and allowing you to comment on stories.
WHAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE
As well as cookies, we use other types of tracking technologies:
Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels
These are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or advertisements contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you and to inform advertisers how many customers have clicked on their adverts (the information shared with advertisers is aggregated and does not identify you individually).
Flash Cookies
We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.
Tracking URLs
Tracking URLs are a special web link that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of articles that are read.
Device Fingerprinting
We may collect and analyse a device's browser information to help identify that device, present content correctly, conduct analytics and help prevent and detect fraud.
If you Access our Services from a Mobile Device
We may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geo-location data, and other transactional information for that device. We may also use the unique identifier to validate free trials, for example.
WHAT CATEGORIES OF COOKIES DO WE USE AND WHY?
Essential Cookies and Similar Technologies
These are vital for the running of our services on our websites and apps. Without the use of these cookies, parts of our websites would not function. For example, we use these cookies to:
help us identify which of our readers have a subscription in order to access content they are entitled to on the website
tell if you are logged in to your account, which allows extra functionality, such as commenting on stories
identify and prevent threats to our sites
protect your information and our business from outside threats
allow you to connect to our website
allow you to select and purchase products and services on our websites
measure audiences across our websites for industry reporting purposes
Analytics Cookies and Similar Technologies
These collect information about your use of our websites and apps, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on The Sun or The Times websites allowing us to display the most popular articles more prominently. They help us record how you interact with our websites, such as how you navigate around pages and from page to page, identifying improvements we can make to the customer journey. They also help identify any difficulties you have accessing our services, so we can fix any problems. Additionally, these cookies allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you. We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and mobile app settings.
We may place cookies and similar technologies on behalf of comScore who help us measure the size and quality of our audiences across platforms. You can learn more and control how comScore use your information here.
Functional/Preference Cookies and Similar Technologies
These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like language, your username (so you can log in faster), text size, and location, so we can show you relevant content to where you are. They allow us to customise the services you have accessed. We also use these cookies to provide you with services such as video clips.
Social media cookies
These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on our sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter. These cookies collect information about your social media interaction with our websites, such as whether or not you have an account with the social media site and whether you are logged into it when you interact with content on our websites. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities.
Tracking, Advertising Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that we think may be more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online adverts based on your previous web browsing activity, known as "online behavioural advertising" (OBA). Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited. Adverts based on what you have been looking at are then displayed to you when you visit websites which use the same advertising networks.
These cookies may also be used to:
track how many times adverts are seen by users;
determine if an advert lead to a click through to another website and lead to a sale or other action;
protect our advertisers’ brands; and
provide you with adverts based on your location, offers you click on, and other similar interactions with our websites and apps.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES
We sell space on our websites and apps to advertisers. The adverts they display on our websites will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping). You may also see adverts from these advertisers on other websites you visit.
Third parties that support our services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services.
We do not control third party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies and whether your cookie data will be transferred to a third country by checking the third party's cookie policy.
