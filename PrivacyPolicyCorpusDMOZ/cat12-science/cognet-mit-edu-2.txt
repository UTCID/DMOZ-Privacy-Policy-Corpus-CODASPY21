Terms of Use
Terms of Use
Use of CogNet will be deemed to indicate acceptance of these Terms of Use, as a condition of the User’s license.  “You” and “your” as used in these Terms of Use mean the individual user of CogNet, not the user’s employer or educational institution.  “User” means any person making use of CogNet, including you.
Member Activities
The MIT Press has established some rules of the road for its members.
CogNet Members agree to seven basic rules designed to maintain CogNet as an interesting, lively, courteous, and legally permissible place:
Members may not interfere with other Members' use and enjoyment of CogNet (for example, by harassing, threatening or stalking another participant of a chat room, forum, seminar, or threaded message, including the use of expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity);
Members may not use CogNet to conduct any activity that is illegal or violates the rights of others, provide instructional information about illegal activities, or promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual;
Members may not use CogNet to advertise or sell products or services to others;
Members must immediately inform The MIT Press if they have reason to believe that another Member is infringing any copyrights or other proprietary materials;
Members may not post or transmit material that is libelous, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, harmful, threatening, abusive or hateful, that contains nudity or pornography, that violates the property rights of others (including without limitation infringing use of a copyright or trademark), that violates the privacy or publicity right of others, that is in violation of applicable laws, or that is used to circumvent manufacturer-installed copy-protect devices, including serial or registration numbers for software programs, or any type of cracker utilities;
Members may not post or disclose any personally identifiable information belonging to children or display material that exploits children under 18 years of age; and
Members may not impersonate another Member or CogNet staff member.
A Member posting material represents that such material is owned by the Member or used with permission of the copyright holder; the Member grants to The MIT Press a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content.
The MIT Press has no responsibility for the content of any material posted by Members. However, if a Member violates this Agreement or if The MIT Press believes in good faith that any portion of the material a Member posts is infringing any copyrights or proprietary rights, The MIT Press reserves the right in its sole discretion to (i) edit or delete in whole or in part such Member's posted material appearing on CogNet, (ii) refuse access to all or portions of CogNet to such Member, and/or (iii) terminate such Member's membership. Member profiles, posted messages, participation in forums and chat rooms, and any other Member posted content contain the opinions and views of other Members and The MIT Press is not responsible for their content.
General Behavior Guidelines for Members
The MIT Press asks that Members observe the same common courtesies that they would observe at any face to face academic gathering (or that people would expect them to observe!). Members should avoid ad hominem attacks (criticisms that are aimed at the person rather than at the ideas being espoused). The MIT Press reminds Members that, because tone of voice and facial expressions do not easily travel over the Internet, the intent of a message can easily be misinterpreted by others. The MIT Press asks that Members make the effort to type those extra few words that can change what would otherwise be a rude message into a polite, but vigorous questioning of an idea or concept.
For Members' own protection, Members should not give any personal information or their password to anyone whether in chat rooms, forums or threaded messages. CogNet's staff will never ask a Member for their password.
The content of CogNet is derived from many sources, including but not limited to MIT Press, other publishers, and individuals who post material of their own. Some of this material is copy-protected, and it is a violation of the Member license to disable or assist others to disable such copy protection. With respect to any material included in CogNet that is not copy-protected, a Member may:
Download articles, chapters, and other similar quantities of such material for personal use, and archive similar quantities of such material on his/her own personal computer. Note: the purpose of this is to enable research-driven, as-needed downloading. This means (among other things) that bulk downloading is expressly forbidden, as is serial or cumulative downloading that results in a Member reproducing on his or her computer, in effect, all or any substantial subset of any journal issue or book or other work contained on CogNet.
Print out journal articles, chapters of books, and other similar quantities of such material for personal use. As above, bulk printing and serial printing that results in the user reproducing all or any substantial subset of any journal issue or book or other work contained on CogNet are not allowed.
Send one copy of any article, chapter, and other similar quantity of material by email, hard copy, or fax to one person at another location for that individual's personal use as above. This means (among other things) that bulk forwarding is expressly forbidden, as is serial or cumulative forwarding that results in a third person's reproducing on his or her computer, in effect, all or any substantial subset of CogNet.
Make traditional scholarly re-use of material within the bounds of fair use. All other uses are prohibited. Without limitation, a Member may not: disseminate any such material except as noted above; make multiple copies in either digital or paper form; or store any electronic file of such material on any intranet or other centrally accessible network or server, including but not limited to for "coursepack" purposes. Also please note that the above permissions to download, print out, and distribute copies, do not apply to materials (including, without limitation, monographs) that are copy-protected, and any attempt to disable copy-protection of such materials is a violation of the licenses herein granted.
