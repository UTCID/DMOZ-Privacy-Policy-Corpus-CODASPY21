Privacy Policy
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the users of this Site.
The Air Movement and Control Association International, Inc.
(referred to as "AMCA"), to which this Site relates, is an international
not-for- profit trade association serving industry and the public since
1917. References to "we" or "us" herein collectively refer to AMCA.
This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect your
personally identifiable information, and about what choices you have
concerning our use of such information. Please read this policy
carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order
to address new issues and reflect changes on this Site. We will post
those changes here so that you will always know what information we
gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose
that information to anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly.
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy,
please send an e-mail to the Director of Marketing and Communications at communications@amca.org.
Scope of Privacy Policy
This policy applies to your use of the www.amca.org website, which is
operated by or on behalf of AMCA (collectively, the "Site"). This
policy does not apply to your use of other websites to which this Site
may link. This policy covers only information collected on this Site and
does not cover any information collected offline by us.
Personally Identifiable Information
We may request personally identifiable information from you (such as
your name, street address, telephone number, credit card number, e-mail
address, and/or any other identifier that permits the physical or online
contacting of you) in connection with your use of, or participation in,
online registration for AMCAs mailing list, making purchases from the
AMCA Site store, email address provided through general correspondence
with AMCA, and requests for additional information (including via email
to us), and in connection with other activities, services or resources
we make available on this Site. In all of these cases, we will collect
personally identifiable information from you only if you voluntarily
submit such information to us. Except as otherwise provided in this
policy, we will never intentionally disclose any personally identifiable
information about you as an individual user to any third party without
having received your permission.
If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may
use it to conduct any of these activities. We may also use cookie
technology and Web beacons (discussed in detail below) to improve your
experience of these activities, including to remember your preferences,
customize the content or authenticate your access to your personal
information. In addition, in the event your personally identifiable
information is requested as part of our outreach efforts, such
personally identifiable information may be added to your profile.
We may also contact you to confirm registration information, if
applicable, and about your account status, and regarding changes to this
Site's Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.
If you give us your permission, we may also use personally
identifiable information for informational purposes. On occasion, for
example, we may send you emails to update you regarding our work. For us
to obtain your permission to send you this information, we will give
you an opportunity to "opt-in" at the time our request for your personal
information is made. If you do "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at
any time, even after you have provided personal information, by
following the procedures set forth below at the end of this Privacy
Policy. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you
initially do not choose to "opt-in," or if you later "opt-out," you may
not be eligible for certain outreach efforts from us for which a name,
e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable
information is needed.
We have the following exceptions to these policies: We will release
specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid
legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or
court order. We will also release specific information in special cases,
such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of this Site,
or a physical or property threat to you or others. We may also transfer
user information, including personally identifiable information, in
connection with a transfer of either AMCAs assets to another entity or
other fundamental corporate change.
Further, the information you enter when making a purchase on the AMCA
Site store will be shared with payment processors, financial gateways,
and your credit card company to authorize credit card payments. Such
information may also be shared with necessary third parties solely for
the purpose or carrying out the transactions.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
information and password. You shall be responsible for all uses of your
registration, if applicable, whether or not authorized by you. You agree
to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your registration
or password.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of:
"Cookie" technology: A "cookie" is an element of data that a web site
can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.
"IP address tracking": An IP address is a number that is assigned to
your computer when you are on the Internet. When you request pages from
this Site, our servers log your IP address.
"Web beacons": A Web beacon, or "clear gif", is a small graphic image
on a webpage or web-based document that a web site can use to determine
information about a user.
Non-personally identifiable information might include the browser you
use, the type of computer, technical information about your means of
connection to this Site - such as the operating systems and the Internet
service providers utilized, and other similar information. Our systems
may also automatically gather information about the areas you visit and
search terms you utilize on this Site and about the links you may select
from within this Site to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere
online.
We use such information to administer the Site and, in the aggregate,
to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources
provided on this Site. This way we know which areas of this Site are
favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what
technologies are being used so that we may continually improve this
Site.
We may share this aggregate statistical information with our
partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we will not share any
individual names, personal navigational or other personal information.
Further, we currently contract with a third party web analytics
provider to help manage and optimize this Site. We use this service to
help us research how visitors use this Site. To do this, we use Web
beacons and cookie technology on this Site. The type of information we
collect includes the number of hits a web page receives and the type of
browser used. By supplementing our records, this information helps us
learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors.
Although this third-party provider logs the information coming from this
Site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
Links To Other Sites
Users will find content on this Site that link to the sites of
organizations who have resources for the purposes of education and
information in connection with AMCA. We do not control the contents or
links that appear on these sites. In addition, these sites or services,
including their contents and links, may be constantly changing. These
sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer
service policies, or no policy (policies) at all. We encourage you to
review the privacy policies of any third party sites or services before
providing any of them with your personal information.
Security Policy
Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority. We
have taken careful measures to secure both your information and our
physical premises. We exercise great care in providing safe transmission
of your information from your PC to our servers (unless sent by a means
outside of our control, such as e-mail).
Access To/Correction of Information
If you would like to review any personal information we have retained
about you in our database, please send us an e-mail request for this
information at communications@amca.org.
To help us address your request, please specify which information you
wish to review. Once you have reviewed this information, at your request
we will correct personal information about you that you state is
erroneous. To request such a correction, please send an e-mail to communications@amca.org.
You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to
completely remove or modify information in our databases and servers
although we will make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request.
Choice/Opt-Out
If at any time you would like to stop receiving AMCA information or
opt-out of a feature, you may go back to this Site and change your
options. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to
completely remove or modify information in our databases and servers
although we will make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request.
Any electronic updates or email messages sent in connection with AMCA
will provide recipients with the opportunity to opt out of receiving
future automated communications from us.
Consent to Transfer
The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the
European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be
aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the
United States. By using our Web Site, participating in any of our
services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this
transfer.
Your Acceptance of These Terms
By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this Site.
Your continued use of this Site following the posting of changes to
these terms will mean that you accept those changes.
