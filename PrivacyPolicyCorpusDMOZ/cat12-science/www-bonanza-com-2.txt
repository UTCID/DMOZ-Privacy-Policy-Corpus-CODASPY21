Bonanza collects information from you when you register and conduct certain activities on the Site. We collect your full name, valid telephone number, contact/billing information, email address, and shipping address. Most of this information is collected only when you decide to become a seller on the site. Each Member must create a unique user id and password. We also provide you the opportunity to create a profile on the Site, which, depending on your preferences can be public or private. Please note that any information you select to provide in your public profile or via other public areas of the Site can be viewed and used by other Members of these forums to send you unsolicited messages. Bonanza is not responsible for the personal information users' elect to disclose in public forums and we encourage you to use discretion.
When you elect to email a friend about the Site, we request their email address to fulfill your request.

In the event that you select to import your contacts, we shall not store your password but shall access your information specifically for the purpose of updating your address book. We do not use the third party personal information of your contacts that you store in your account for any promotional purposes, or any purpose not explicitly requested by you.
We post testimonials on the Site. These testimonials include users' names. We obtain users' permission prior to posting testimonials on the Site. We are not responsible for the personal information a user elects to share within their testimonial.

However, we don't make this information publicly visible/available in any way. On occasion we may also employ Web Beacons and clear Gifs on the Site to track information and traffic on the Site. A Web Beacon is a small 1x1 image that allows a Site to monitor site traffic.
Third Party Cookies: We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our Site to help us administer our Site and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personal information.

How is my information used?
The information collected from Bonanza Members is used to improve product offerings, customize our Site's content and layout, and for marketing and statistical effort. Occasionally, we will send you emails about our new services or promotions. You can always opt-out of receiving any information from us by updating your account preferences in your account or by using the unsubscribe link contained in each email. To change access, delete, or modify any of your personal information can be accomplished by logging into your account on the Site. We do reserve the right to send users service and notification emails, which are considered a part of your account; given that these messages are not promotional in nature, you generally cannot opt-out of account notifications without deleting your account.
Who will see my personal information?
Our number one priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. We will not willfully disclose your personal information to third parties. And we will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone. However, certain personal information will be made available to others in the process of using our Site. This information includes:
Other visitors to our Site may view your user ID, rating, city, profile (which includes multiple fields you may elect to fill out or leave blank), and other items you have for sale;
In order to complete the transaction, the buyer and seller are provided with each others email and postal address;
When making an offer, the seller can view your user ID, rating and your city.
Of course, once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our Site, Bonanza has no control over how that information is used by the other individual. You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you meet through our Site, as the only protection you will have is whatever terms you agree to directly with the other individual.

You consent to share the information;

Your actions on our Site are, or appear to be, in violation of the Terms of Service and disclosure of this information will assist in efforts to enforce the Terms of Service;
You post a listing, which Bonanza believes in its sole discretion, may create liability for Bonanza and disclosure of this personal information may minimize or eliminate its liability.

Messages sent between buyers and sellers on Bonanza may be shared with the third party payment processor in the event of a purchase dispute. This third party isn’t authorized to utilize your personal information for any other purposes.
