Institutional Research & Assessment
Mission
The primary purpose of the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment is to support
the College’s mission through data collection, reporting, and analysis.
The emphasis of this office is to provide strategic analytical support in shaping
the long-term institutional policies and programs geared towards resource allocation,
new program development, student success and outcomes, competitive positioning and
institutional effectiveness. In addition, Institutional Research serves as the central
repository of official data for state, federal, and other external agencies used for
reporting purposes.
