Cookies are small amounts of information in the form of text files which we store on the device you use to access the Site. Cookies allow us to monitor your use of the software and simplify your use of the site. For example, a temporary cookie is also used to keep track of your “session”. Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after you quit your browser) you would have to log on every time you access a new page.
If you do not wish for cookies to be installed on your device, you can:
(1) change your cookie settings in the cookie preference centre (you may opt in to having our Site’s cookies stored on your devices or disable cookies according to your preferences); or
(2) change the settings on your browser or device to reject cookies. For more information about how to reject cookies using your internet browser settings please consult the “Help” section of your internet browser (or alternatively visit http://www.aboutcookies.org). Please note that, whilst access to the website is not conditional upon the acceptance of cookies by you, if you do set your Internet browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to access all of the functions of the Site.  Please also note that the device that you are using may affect which settings you are able to change in your browser.
If you are happy with the use of cookies by Hindawi and our selected partners, please manage your preferences accordingly.
Please be aware
Please note that we will make all reasonable efforts to comply with your consent preferences but due to certain technological restrictions and ways in which the technology was developed, from time-to-time, you may find that we cannot accommodate all your requests without compromising your experience of the Site.  Due to the nature of the technology, unpredictability of browser configurations and user behaviour, we cannot unequivocally guarantee that no cookies will be set once you have opted out. To ensure best results, please also install cookie blockers in your chosen browser.
