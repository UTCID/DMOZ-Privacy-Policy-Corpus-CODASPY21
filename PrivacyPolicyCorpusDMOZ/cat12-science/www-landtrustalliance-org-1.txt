Security of Your Information
We will take appropriate steps to protect the security of your personal information. We will also protect your personal information in storage. We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from: unauthorized access; improper use or disclosure; unauthorized modification; and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. All our employees who have access to, and are associated with processing of personal data, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitor's personal data.
All sensitive information (such as your credit card information) provided to the Land Trust Alliance through our website is transmitted either to us or to our credit card processor using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. No credit card information is stored on our site.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information to the fullest extent, we cannot ensure or completely guarantee the security of such information.
The VeriSign Secure Site Badge
The globally recognized VeriSign Secure Site Program allows you to learn more about the websites that you visit before you submit any confidential information. The Alliance's investment in this advanced technology ensures that the web page you are visiting is authentic, secure and that any data or information you submit will be protected by 128-bit SSL encryption. Whenever you see the VeriSign Secure Site badge on our websites, you can personally verify that the web page in question is both secure and administered by the Alliance. You may, therefore, submit personally identifiable information and/or sensitive data (such as credit card numbers) with the assurance that:
The Alliance's website has a VeriSign Secure Server ID
VeriSign has verified the organizational name and that the Alliance has the proof of right to use it;
The website legitimately runs under the auspices of the Alliance; and
All information sent to the website, if in an SSL session, is encrypted, protecting against disclosure to third parties.
Links to Third Party Sites
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.
Cookies
'Cookies' are small files sent from a web server to your computer through your browser program. There are two types of cookies: non-persistent and persistent cookies.
A non-persistent cookie enables a website to temporarily keep information on your computer as you travel from one page to another on our site. This cookie is automatically deleted from your machine when you close your browser.  Because these cookies are necessary to provide some functions, failure to allow such cookies will make our website unavailable to you.
A persistent cookie is kept even when you close your browser. You can manually delete these cookies using commands specific to your browser and computer system. These cookies store information that would generally not change from session to session. They also contain information that would need to be reentered by you each time you visit the website. For example, a common use of persistent cookies is to allow a registered site visitor to enter the site without having to specify their user-id and password.
Use of Cookies
We use cookies for various reasons.  We only read cookies written by our sites. We do not use cookies to obtain information on other websites that you may visit. We may use cookies to store some history about the parts of our sites that you have visited to help you navigate our site more easily or to alert you to related pages on our site that may interest you.
Our Compliance with Federal Law
Children's Guidelines
The Alliance complies fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
None of the websites covered by this policy knowingly collect identifiable personal information from children under age 13. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems.  We are unable to reply to information requests from children under the age of 13, if so identified. A parent or guardian must initiate any requests for information from children under the age of 13 on their behalf.  We encourage parents to supervise children when they browse the internet.
Spam
The Alliance complies fully with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act). To this end, the Alliance:
Always offers recipients of e-mail marketing and e-newsletters a clear means of opting-out from the receipt of future messages;
Always includes a link to the Alliance's physical address within the body of all e-mail messages;
Never uses false or misleading header information in any email message;
Never attempts to deceive email recipients by using deceptive subject lines;
Never uses automated means to harvest email addresses from websites or web services; and
Never generates email addresses using programmatic methods.

Changes to the Privacy Policy and Changes in Ownership
We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post an appropriate notice of changes to the Privacy Policy on our Site. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the Site, as well as to existing information held by us.
If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your Personal Information from our records, as described in "how to access, modify or delete your personal information."
