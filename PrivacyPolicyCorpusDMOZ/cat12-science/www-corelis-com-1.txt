Privacy Policy
EWA Technologies, Inc., under its brand name “Corelis Inc.” (“we”, “our” or “us”), may ask you to provide information that personally identifies you or is otherwise personally identifiable in certain circumstances, including for example when you download .pdf files, download evaluation software, download drivers or ask for additional information (“Personal Information”). Examples of Personal Information are your name or business name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, zip code and occupation or industry.
We use your Personal Information for three primary purposes:
To help you quickly find products, services or information on this website.
To help us in providing relevant content.
To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services.
If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you can still use most of this website. However, you will not be able to access areas that require you to disclose Personal Information.
We will not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor will we share with or provide to third parties your Personal Information unless we have your consent (which may be inferred as being granted based on circumstances of use of this website and specific product requests) and (1) sharing your Personal Information is required to provide the product or service you have requested, or (2) We need to send your Personal Information to resellers which work on our behalf in order to provide you a product or service (which companies will not have any right to use your Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us). We will disclose your Personal Information to the extent required in the event it must respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, or if we find that your actions on this website violate any terms of use, any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or any terms of any license agreements you agree to.
If you do not want us to send you e-mail or postal mail regarding our products or services, you may send email to us and ask to be taken off the our mailing list.
In addition to the foregoing policy, we restrict access to your Personal Information to those employees who reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you, and we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your Personal Information.
In addition to collecting Personal Information, we may set and access “cookies” on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your computer’s browser from a web site and stored on your hard drive. However, your browser has modifiable preferences which allow you to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. In order to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a web site to access cookies it has sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to utilize portions of this website that require you to “sign in” to allow access to the website cookie set on your browser. Nevertheless, this website uses its own cookies, for a limited number of purposes, and all Personal Information that may be included in the cookie is subject to this Privacy Policy. Examples of uses include accessing your Personal Information when you “sign in” so that we can provide you with customized content; keeping track of preferences as you are using this website; estimating and reporting traffic information on this website; and conducting research to improve this website content and services. Other uses may occur.
This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for www.Corelis.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:
What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.

We will not share your Personal Data with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

Cookies
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. We use “session” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.
Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies. We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behavior across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google’s Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin. Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
