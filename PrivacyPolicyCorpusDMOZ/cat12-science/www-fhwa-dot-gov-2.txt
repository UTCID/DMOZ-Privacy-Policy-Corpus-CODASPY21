FHWA Web Publishing Schedule
Section 207(f)(2) of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires Federal agencies to develop an inventory of information to be published on their Web sites, establish a schedule for publishing information, post the schedules on the Web site, and make those schedules available for public comment.
In the table below, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has identified the inventory of content that already exists on the Web site and new content that is planned for the future. When new information becomes available that is of interest to the general public, FHWA will offer that content on the Web site as soon as possible.
If new information becomes available at FHWA that is important to the public, we are committed to putting it on our Web site. If you have suggestions for additional information that should be made available, please let us know.
