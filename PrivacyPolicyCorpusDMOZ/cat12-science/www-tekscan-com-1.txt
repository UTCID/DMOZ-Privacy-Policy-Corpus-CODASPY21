Privacy Policy
Last update: May 25, 2018
Please take a moment to read the Privacy Policy for this website (www.tekscan.com), owned and operated by Tekscan, Inc. ("Tekscan", "we", "us"), a Delaware corporation. Tekscan is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy below explains how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
By using this website, you consent and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into Tekscan's Terms of Use for this website.
Information We Collect
We collect information about you in two ways: information you provide to us and information we automatically collect. In either case we use the information primarily to communicate with you or improve our products & services, including this website (collectively, "Services").
Note: Where applicable and for your convenience we provide links to the privacy policies of third party services we use.
Information you provide to us
You voluntarily provide information to us when you enter your details about yourself on any form on this website or convey that information to us over the phone or in person. Some of this information is personal in nature and can be used to identify you. Below is a list of several ways that you submit such information to us:
Contact forms. If you fill out a contact form you will be asked for your name, email address, phone number, and other identifiable information. We use this information so that we can effectively respond to your inquiry.
Content forms. Tekscan regularly publishes downloadable content such as eBooks, webinars, case studies, whitepapers, and so on for the benefit of its audience. Much of this content is available after a visitor fills out the appropriate form on the website. Similar to contact forms, you will be asked to enter your name, email address, and other information in this process.
Email. If you choose to correspond with us via email then you are at least providing us with your email address and your name.
eCommerce. Many of our products are available for immediate purchase in our webstore.  Entering into a transaction with us via our website requires much more information than the above, including billing and shipping information, as well as credit card details. We use this transactional information to process your order. Some of this transactional information is stored on our web server. For payment processing we use Authorize.net or PayPal.
Authorize.net privacy policy: https://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/
PayPal privacy policy: https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
User registrations. Although not required to transact with us online, a user could elect to register on our website. In doing so you would be asked to create a username and enter your email address.
Blog subscriptions. Tekscan regularly publishes a blog. If you choose to subscribe to the blog then you will be asked for your email address, which is solely used to send you notifications of newly published blog posts.
Phone calls. When you call us you will likely be asked for information such as your name, phone number, area of interest, and other information. We use that information to route your call to the appropriate department so that we may better serve you.
Tradeshows. If you provide us with information at a tradeshow, such as through a business card or signing up to a newsletter, then that information could include your name and contact information.
Surveys. From time to time we may run surveys for a particular audience. Information provided by the visitor, such as name and email address, may identify that person.
SurveyMonkey privacy policy: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/
Information we automatically collect
When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain information about your visit. Most of this information relates to the usage of our website and helps us improve our Services. Unlike information you provide to us, substantially all of the automatically-collected information is anonymized and aggregated.
Website visitor logs. Visitor logs contain basic, timestamped information about visitors to our website including IP address, browser name and version, web page visited, device type, referring page, and so on. Our website logs are files located on our Apache web server, which only we have access to.
Location information. We use your IP address to determine where your machine is physically located with reasonable certainty. For this we reference your machine's IP address with the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN). Location information is used primarily to determine if you are a visitor from the EU, in order to comply with the GDPR.
Website usage. Tekscan uses third party services such as Google Analytics and Marketo to monitor website usage and performance. Usage trackers such as these assist us primarily with improving and optimizing our website.
Google privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Marketo privacy policy: https://www.marketo.com/company/legal/
Digital advertising. Tekscan engages in digital advertising to drive awareness of our products. Certain information collected by a user who has clicked an ad or visited related pages on our website may be used to remarket (show ads to) to the user again. We rely on third parties for this process including Google AdWords, BingAds, and Facebook.
