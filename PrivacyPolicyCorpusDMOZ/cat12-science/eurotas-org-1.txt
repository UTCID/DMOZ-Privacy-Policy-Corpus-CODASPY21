The purposes of the processing of data are set out in Article 2 of our Constitution (https://eurotas.org/eurotas-constitution/).
Your rights
GDPR grants specific rights, summarized below, which you can exercise free of charge, subject to statutory exceptions. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal Personal Data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. To exercise any of your rights, you can file a request here  mail@eurotas.org.
Should you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority where you live or where you believe a breach may have occurred. We encourage you to come to us in the first instance but, to the extent that this right applies to you, you are entitled to complain directly to the relevant Supervisory Authority.
2.1. Right to withdraw consent
Wherever we rely on your consent, you will be able to withdraw that consent at any time you choose and at your own initiative by contacting us here mail@eurotas.org. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the collection and processing of your data based on your consent up until the moment where you withdraw your consent. Please note that we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out in this Privacy Policy.
2.2. Right to access and rectify your data
You have the right to access, review, and rectify your Personal Data. You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of your information, to review or correct it if you wish to rectify any information like your name, email address and/or any other preferences, you can easily do so by contacting us here mail@eurotas.org. You may also request a copy of the Personal Data processed as described in this Privacy Policy.
2.3. Right to erasure
In accordance with GDPR, you have the right to erasure of your Personal Data processed by us as described in this Privacy Policy in case it is no longer needed for the purposes for which the Personal Data was initially collected or processed or in the event you have withdrawn your consent or objected to processing as described in this Privacy Policy and no other legal ground for processing applies. Should you wish to have your Personal Data erased, please file a request here mail@eurotas.org.
2.4. Right to restriction of processing
Under certain circumstances described in GDPR, you may ask us to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. This is for example the case when you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data. In such event, we will restrict the processing until we can verify the accuracy of your data.
2.5. Right to object to processing
Under certain circumstances described in GDPR, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data, including where your Personal Data is processed for direct marketing purposes.
2.6. Right to data portability
Where you have provided your data directly to us and where the processing is carried out by automated means and based on your consent or the performance of a contract between you and us, you have the right to receive the Personal Data processed about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit this data to another service provider.
Security measures
Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented in order to ensure an appropriate level of security of your Personal Data, including but not limited to encryption techniques, physical and IT system access controls, obligations of confidentiality, etc.
In the event Personal Data is compromised as a result of a Personal Data Breach we will make the necessary notifications, as required under applicable laws.
How is your Personal Data shared with Third Parties?
We only share or disclose information as described herein, including with Third Parties.
Your Personal Data will also be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials if required for the purposes above, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of the Controller(s) legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws.
International Data Transfers
If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the data that we collect from you as described in this policy may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the EEA. Countries outside the EEA may not have laws which provide the same level of protection to your Personal Data as laws within the EEA. Where this is the case we will put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that such transfers comply with GDPR, either by putting in place Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate protection or by ensuring that the transfer is done to an organisation that complies with Privacy Shield in case the transfer is made to the United States of America.
In case you wish to obtain more details about our data transfer safeguards and the mechanisms in place, you may contact us at mail@eurotas.org.
How long will we keep your Personal Data?
We retain your Personal Data for as long as is required to fulfil the activities set out in this Privacy Policy, for as long as otherwise communicated to you or for as long as is permitted by applicable law. For example, we may retain your Personal Data if it is reasonably necessary to comply with any legal obligations, meet any regulatory requirements, resolve any disputes or litigation, or as otherwise needed to enforce this Policy and prevent fraud and abuse.
To determine the appropriate retention period for the information we collect from you, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data, the purposes for which we process the Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
Does this Privacy Policy apply to Third Party websites?
If you click on a link to a Third-Party website, you will be taken to a website we do not control and our Privacy Policy will no longer be in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website is subject to the terms of use and privacy and other policies of such Third-Party website. Read the privacy policies of other websites carefully. We are not responsible or liable for the information or content on such Third-Party websites.
What happens if we make modifications to this Policy?
We reserve the right to modify and update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will bring these changes to your attention should they be indicative of a fundamental change to the processing or be relevant to the nature of the processing or be relevant to you and impact your data protection rights.
How to contact us?
Questions, comments, remarks, requests or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy are welcome and should be addressed to: mail@eurotas.org or A-1090, Vienna, Porzellangasse 56/2/10.
