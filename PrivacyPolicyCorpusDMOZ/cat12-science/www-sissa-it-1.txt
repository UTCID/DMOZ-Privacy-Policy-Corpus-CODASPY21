Cookie Policy
This page outlines the cookie policy in use in this website along with details of cookies used by the website. This information may change over time and the latest version can be found at this page.
Most websites you visit use cookies. Cookies are small text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Further information about what cookies are can be found on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie
Types of cookies
The Italian Data Protection Authority broadly divides cookies into different categories depending on their use and on who sends (sets) the cookie.
Technical cookies
Technical cookies are cookies necessary for website navigation or to provide the services offered by the website. They are not used for ulterior purposes.
To quote the Italian Data Protection Authority,
Technical cookies are those used exclusively with a view to "carrying out the transmission of a communication on an electronic communications network, or insofar as this is strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service that has been explicitly requested by the contracting party or user to provide the said service."
Profiling cookies
Profiling cookies are cookies used to track user navigation and create a profile of their habits which can then be used to send advertising messages to the user's device.
Once again quoting the Italian Data Protection Authority,
Due to the particular invasiveness that such devices may have in the private sphere of users, European and Italian legislation requires the user to be adequately informed about their use and to express their valid consent.
Cookies can also be categorized into first party and third party cookies depending on who sets the cookie.
First party cookies
These are set directly by the website that you are visiting and can only be accessed by that site.
Third party cookies
Third party cookies are set by a different organisation to the owner of the website you are visiting. For example, the website might use a third party analytics company who will set their own cookie to perform this service. The website you are visiting may also contain content embedded from, for example YouTube or Flickr, and these sites may set their own cookies.
Cookies used by this website
First party cookies

Like many websites we collect analytics data to help improve the services offered to users. We use Matomo - https://matomo.org/ (an open source alternative to Google Analytics) which has the advantage that any data collected is stored on servers owned by us and not transferred to third parties.
