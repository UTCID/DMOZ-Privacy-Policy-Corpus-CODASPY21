their own web servers, administrators at Internet service providers
(ISPs), and home users who run their own servers at the end of cable
modems or DSL lines.Chapter 14 addresses one of
the most important but frequently overlooked topics—how to protect your
computer’s physical well-being.Chapter 15 explores security
having to do with your computer’s operating system.Chapter 16 discusses the
added security issues that arise when running web servers that can
execute programs or scripts.Chapter 17 gives
step-by-step instructions for enabling SSL on the Apache and IIS web
servers.Chapter 18 broadens the
security discussion to show how to defend your service against problems
resulting from your ISP or the Internet’s Domain Name Service
(DNS).Chapter 19 explores the
specific legal options available to you after your computer system has
been broken into, as well as other legal issues of concern to
administrators.
