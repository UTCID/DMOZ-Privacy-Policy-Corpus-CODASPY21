TERMS & CONDITIONS
Terms & Conditions
Our terms
These terms
What these terms cover. These are the terms and conditions on which we supply products to you.
Why you should read them. Please read these terms carefully before you submit your order to us. These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide products to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these terms, please contact us to discuss.
Information about us and how to contact us
Who we are. We are GM8 Group Limited (company registered number 4414980), whose main trading address is at 54 Wilbury Way, Hitchin, Herts, SG4 0TP. Our registered VAT number is GB944150045.
How to contact us. You can contact us by telephoning our customer service team on 01462 429765 or by writing to us at cs@gm8group.com or 54 Wilbury Way, Hitchin, Herts, SG4 0TP.
How we may contact you. If we have to contact you we will do so by telephone or by writing to you at the email address or postal address you provided to us in your order.
"Writing" includes emails. When we use the words "writing" or "written" in these terms, this includes emails.
Our contract with you
If we cannot accept your order. If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the product. This might be because the product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product or because we are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.
Your order number. We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.
Our products
Products may vary slightly from their pictures. The images of the products on our website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that a device's display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the products. Your product may vary slightly from those images.
Product packaging may vary. The packaging of the product may vary from that shown in images on our website.
Making sure your measurements are accurate. If we are making the product to measurements you have given us you are responsible for ensuring that these measurements are correct. You can find information and tips on how to measure on our website or by contacting us.
Your rights to make changes
If you wish to make a change to the product you have ordered please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the product, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change. If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are unacceptable to you, you may want to end the contract (see clause 8- Your rights to end the contract).
Our rights to make minor changes
We may change the product:
to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and
to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements. These changes will not affect your use of the product.
Providing the products
Delivery information. The costs, timescale and delivery terms will be as displayed to you on our website. These can be found here.
We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our supply of the products is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received.
When you become responsible for the goods. A product which is goods will be your responsibility from the time we deliver the product to the address you gave us or you collect it from us.
When you own goods. You own a product which is goods once we have received payment in full.
Your rights to end the contract
You can always end your contract with us. Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing and when you decide to end the contract:
If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product repaired or replaced or to get some or all of your money back), see clause 11;
If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see clause 2; or
If you have just changed your mind about the product, see clause 3. You may be able to get a refund if you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any goods (we will only refund the standard delivery cost for delivering the product to you initially);
Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a contract for a reason set out at (a) or (b) below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any products which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. The reasons are:
we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed; or
there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control.
Exercising your right to change your mind (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013). For most products bought online you have a legal right to change your mind within 14 days and receive a refund. These rights, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, are explained in more detail in these terms.
When you don't have the right to change your mind. You do not have a right to change your mind in respect of:
products sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them;
sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software, once these products are unsealed after you receive them; or
any products which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.
How long do I have to change my mind? How long you have depends on what you have ordered and how it is delivered. If you have bought goods you have 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the goods, unless your goods are split into several deliveries over different days. In this case you have until 14 days after the day you (or someone you nominate) receives the last delivery to change your mind about the goods.
How to end the contract with us (including if you have changed your mind)
Tell us you want to end the contract. To end the contract with us, please let us know by doing one of the following:
Phone or email. Call customer services on 01472 429765 or email us at cs@gm8group.com. Please provide your name, home address, details of the order and, where available, your phone number and email address.
Online. Complete the online form on our website.
By post. Simply write to us at that address, including details of what you bought, when you ordered or received it and your name and address.
Returning products after ending the contract. If you end the contract for any reason after products have been dispatched to you or you have received them, you must return them to us. You must either return the goods in person to where you bought them, post them back to us at 54 Wilbury Way, Hitchin, Herts, SG4 0TP or (if they are not suitable for posting) allow us to collect them from you. Please call customer services on 01462 429765 or email us at cs@gm8group.com for a return label or to arrange collection. If you are exercising your right to change your mind you must send off the goods within 14 days of telling us you wish to end the contract.
When we will pay the costs of return. We will pay the costs of return:
if the products are faulty or misdescribed; or
if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong
In all other circumstances (including where you are exercising your right to change your mind) you must pay the costs of return.
What we charge for collection. If you are responsible for the costs of return and we are collecting the product from you, we will charge you the direct cost to us of collection.
How we will refund you. We will refund you the price you paid for the products including standard costs of delivery to you, by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.
Deductions from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind. If you are exercising your right to change your mind:
We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.
The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.
When your refund will be made. . If you are exercising your right to change your mind then:
If the products are goods and we have not offered to collect them, your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us. For information about how to return a product to us, see clause 2.
In all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind
Our rights to end the contract
We may end the contract if you break it. We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:
you do not make any payment to us when it is due;
you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the products; or
you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or collect them from us.
You must compensate us if you break the contract. If we end the contract in the situations set out in clause 1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for products we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.
