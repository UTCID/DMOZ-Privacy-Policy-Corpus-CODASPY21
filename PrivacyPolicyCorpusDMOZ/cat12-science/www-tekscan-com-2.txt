Last update: April 30, 2018
Please take a moment to read the Cookie Policy for this website ("Website"), owned and operated by Tekscan, Inc. ("Tekscan", "we", "us"), a Delaware corporation. Our Cookie Policy is designed to assist you in understanding what cookies are, how we use cookies along with a table displaying the cookies we use, additional information about cookies in general, and your choices regarding cookies.
By using this Website, you are agreeing to our using cookies in the manner set out in this Cookie Policy so please read it carefully.
If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of this Website, you should stop using our Website or turn off your cookies but this may affect the functionality of the Website.
What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on the browser or hard drive of your computer (or similar device) by websites that you visit. Cookies are used by practically all websites and the website is often dependent on cookies to function. Cookies can also be used to provide information to the owners of the particular website.
What cookies do we use and why?
We use several different types of cookies. Some of these are session cookies which are temporary and allow us to link your actions during a browser session. Others are persistent cookies which remain on your device for the period of time specified in the cookie.
This Website uses cookies for the following purposes:
Necessary
These cookies are required to enable core Website functionality and are automatically enabled when you use our Website. This type of cookie allows us to remember login details or ensure that your shopping cart is saved during all the steps of the online checkout process, for example.
Functional
Functionality cookies are used to tailor your Website experience. For instance, these types of cookies are used to save and remind you of what products you had in your shopping cart for an incomplete order, so it will save you time if you would like to purchase these products at another time. Another example is that our Website will recognize you if you had previously filled out a form by pre-populating certain fields.

Some of these cookies are managed by third parties, and you may refer to the third parties’ own website privacy notifications for further information. In particular, we use Google Analytics and Marketo cookies to help measure how users interact with our Website content, and to help improve the overall experience on our Website.
