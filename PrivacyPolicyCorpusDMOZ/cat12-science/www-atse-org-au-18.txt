Now, more than ever, a strategic national approach is imperative to improving the management of our most precious resource.
Water will always be scarce in Australia, and the challenges of managing it efficiently will only increase in the future.
There remains significant unfinished business in water reform – much of it complex.
Successfully addressing these challenges will be central to unlocking our water resources as an enabler of improved productivity, liveability and wellbeing – particularly in our urban environments – while protecting and enhancing ecosystems and the environment.
Featured publication
National water management: New reform challenges
The Academy calls on the governments of Australia to develop and commit to a new decadal strategy for national water management.
