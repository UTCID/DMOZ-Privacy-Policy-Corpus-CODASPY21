COVID-19, effective 11/1/2020
Onset continues to monitor the latest coronavirus developments and guidance from local authorities, the Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization. The health and well-being of our customers, suppliers, employees, and the surrounding community is of the utmost importance to us, so we are taking the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe.
At this time, Onset’s ability to build our products and ship them to our customers as scheduled has not been affected by the coronavirus situation. We are taking proactive measures to work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate any potential supply chain disruptions and will continue to provide updates in the future, as needed.

Privacy Policy
Onset Computer Corporation (“Onset”) values our customers, their information, privacy, and trust. This Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information through our websites and mobile applications. Specifically, this Policy applies to Onset’s collection, use, storage, and transfer of information associated with Onset’s website, www.onsetcomp.com (the “Site”). If there is something you do not understand about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at info@onsetcomp.com.
Throughout this Policy, we refer to the term “Personal Information.” “Personal Information” is data about an individual who can be identified from that data, or by combining it with other data. Personal Information is usually your name in combination with another identifier, such as date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number, or government-issued identification number. The specific definition of Personal Information varies from one jurisdiction to another.
Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregated data that can no longer be used to identify a specific person, even if combined with other data.
Many of our customers are businesses, rather than individuals. We do not consider Business Information, such as one’s position, business name, title, business email, business phone number, business address, business fax, and other similar business information, to be Personal Information.
Information We Collect
Information Collected Directly from You
We may collect your name, your company name, your email address, phone number, the type of application you are looking to address with our products or services, and your specific inquiry when you sign up to receive information about our products or services, request a price quote, or voluntarily submit other information to us. We use this information to provide the requested information.
If you wish to chat with one of our service professionals, our partner, Salesforce, will collect your name, business name, business address, and the department you work in at your business in order to identify you and your likely concerns or needs. Salesforce may also retain the contents of your chat indefinitely, in case you have follow-up inquiries and to monitor their services.
If you post information in the Onset user forum, we will collect your username and email address as well as any information you may post in the forum to identify you (in whatever way you choose to be identified) and to provide your information to users of the forum for discussion. Information posted to the forum will be kept for the duration of the forum.
When you report a problem with our Site, product, or services, we will collect your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, the hardware and software at issue, as well as a description of your problem so that we may address it. When you contact us via the company email address, we will collect your email address and any information you include in your email to similarly address your concerns.
We collect your name, phone number, and email address when you purchase products or services through our Site or if you create an account on the Site. For payment processing purposes, we will collect credit or debit card information, but we do not retain this information. We use this information to provide you with your product or service, including confirming your request, ensuring delivery of and payment for your product or service, responding to customer service requests, improving the operation of our application, improving the operation of our Site, conducting research and analysis of how our customers use our Site, and assessing which of our products and services may be of interest to you in the future. We will keep this information for up to twelve (12) months from the date you place your order to allow us to provide you with information about your order. In addition, we may retain Personal Information from past orders where necessary to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any moneys owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Use or contractual rights, and take other reasonable actions permitted or required by applicable law.
In the absence of a legal obligation to the contrary, we keep your Personal Information for a year after your last contact with us.
Our Site is not directed to children under age 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 should not provide their Personal Information to us through our Site, to customer service, or in writing. If we learn that Personal Information belonging to anyone under the age of 13 is stored on the Site, we will immediately delete such information and refrain from using it for any purpose.
Other Information We Collect
In addition to collecting information directly from you as described in the previous section, we also automatically gather information when you browse or view our Site. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and other information related to your visit.
We use this browsing information to make sure that the Site and its associated parts are functioning properly, the Site is displayed properly for your equipment and software, and we can provide you with information useful to your location. We also use this information to determine the country or region from which you are visiting to determine what country or region-specific information you see on the Site (e.g., pricing) and to assist in determining whether you are located within a country or region served by one of our distributors (e.g., an “Onset Distributor”).
There are “do not track” or similar browser choices available to internet users with respect to online web activity, but given the present lack of consensus of what constitutes an informed election, appropriate trigger, or breadth of scope of such choice, our Site will not operate any differently when a “do not track” signal is received.
In some of our email messages, you will find a “click-through URL” linked to content on our Site. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click such links in our email messages.
Cookies
We use technologies such as “cookies” so we can remember certain information about you, remember your preferences, or recognize you when you return. Cookies also help us compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can improve our Site and protect our Site from fraud.
A cookie is a text file that is stored on your computer. As text files, cookies cannot read information on your hard drive, run programs, or deliver viruses to your computer.
Most browsers are set to accept cookies automatically. You can set your browser to decline all cookies automatically or to prompt you for a response each time a cookie is offered. If you decline cookies, you may find that you cannot access all of our Site’s features.
We use the Pardot Marketing Automation System ("MAS"). MAS is a lead generation and user activity service that uses cookies. These cookies collect data such as your “click path”, or the steps you take to reach the Site. Further information on the purpose,scope and other details of the data collection and its processing by the MAS is available in the privacy policy of Pardot.
During your browsing session, we use “session” cookies to store information and monitor Site function. For thirty minutes after your session, a cookie tracks the number of visitors to our Site.  Until midnight of the day after your last session, a cookie tracks the number of times you visit the Site. For two weeks after your last session, a cookie retains the items you have placed in the Site’s shopping cart, in case you leave without purchasing and then return to make the purchase. There is a permanent cookie used to remember your password.
Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs, are often used in combination with cookies. Often transparent, these images are part of web pages, and allow those who use web beacons to count users who have visited certain pages and to generate statistics about how a website is used. They are not used to access Personal Information. We do not currently use web beacons, but we may do so in the future.
We also use log files when you visit our Site. Log files track IP addresses, browser type, ISP identity, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, prevent fraud, track website navigation in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell those who use pixel tags whether mail has been opened. One use of information obtained from the use of pixel tags is to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers. We do not currently use pixel tags, but we may do so in the future.
Google AdWords and Google Analytics
We use Google AdWords and Google Analytics in connection with our Site to gather data, such as age, gender, and interests, in order to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences.
Google Adwords and similar programs from other companies (e.g., Crazy Egg) help us target our online ads based on information collected directly from you or by automated means, like cookies. These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.
Google Analytics collects anonymous information that is not used to identify a particular user. This information helps us better understand how visitors use our Site, detect and defend against fraud and other security risks, and present advertisements, products, and/or services of interest to you.
To learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. To learn about how to opt out of Google Analytics, please visit http://tools.Google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Location
You may give consent for our Site to capture and record certain precise geo-location or global positioning data from your device in order to tailor information to your location. We may link such location data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of our Site. You should be able to manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share location information with us, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies, by adjusting your mobile device’s privacy and security settings.
Use of Your Personal Information
We use your Personal Information to further legitimate business interests – to transact business with you and serve you as a customer. As described above, we use your Personal Information to enable you to participate in online transactions, confirm your registration with the Site, send you requested information, administer your account, personalize content so that it applies to you and your interests, compile, analyze, and do research on our user’s demographics and behavior, and detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal. We may also use your Personal Information to communicate with you about products and services we believe you might find of interest and to administer promotions, surveys, contests, and sweepstakes in which you might participate.
We also use the information automatically collected about you during your use of the Site, as described above, to improve the effectiveness of our website, operations, mobile experience, or marketing efforts, or as described elsewhere in this policy, to prevent against fraud and theft, and otherwise to protect our Site’s visitors and our business.
Our employees and agents may view your Personal Information to perform their jobs and service your needs. We authorize access to your Personal Information to them on a need-to-know basis to provide you with our products or services to you, or for one of the other reasons listed in this section.
Sharing Your Personal Information

We may share your Personal Information to affiliated companies or others who help us operate the Site or assess your interest or satisfaction with the Site or our products. When we do so, the affiliated company must agree not to use that information for any other reason.

The information is not used for any other purpose. And if you wish to opt out of this use, you may opt out of this service by following the directions in the Trustpilot correspondence.
Employment applications go to HRdirect, which collects the information on our behalf, screens the data for relevance, and then passes the information on to us so that we can evaluate your information for consideration for employment. HRdirect retains submitted information indefinitely, subject to our direction. HRdirect has agreed to maintain restrictive account access guidelines in order to only access information if it’s absolutely necessary for customer support, as approved by us.

We may sell, transfer and/or disclose your Personal Information as part of a business divestiture, sale, merger, or acquisition of all or a part of our business. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.  In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, your Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset.
In addition, we may share aggregate, non-individual information, incapable of identifying a particular person, with third parties for lawful purposes.

Onset Distributors may use this information for their own marketing or other purposes, subject to applicable laws.
