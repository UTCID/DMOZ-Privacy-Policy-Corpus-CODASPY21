Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only) If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Revision: 02 Date: Nov 2019 Content property of Wood. This document is uncontrolled once printed. Check Wood Management System for the current version.However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person e.g. in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including for tax, immigration, health and safety, national security or law enforcement purposes).If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.7.

International data transfers Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).Specifically, our Social Media providers e.g. Linkedin may have servers that are located around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information it may be processed in any of these countries.However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include:reliance on the EU-US Privacy Shield (under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation) or Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate data transfers to third parties in the US who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it; andimplementing internal data transfer agreements to facilitate data transfers to Wood companies outside of the EEA; andWood implementing a range of organisational and technical security measures, such as cyber security training, role based access and encryption, where appropriate, to ensure personal data is secure.10. Data retention We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.11.

Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
