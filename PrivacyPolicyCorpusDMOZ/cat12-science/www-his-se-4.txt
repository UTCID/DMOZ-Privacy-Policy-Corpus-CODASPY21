Companies keep store a large quantities of data about us, as e.g. our electronic transactions, traces of our internet usage, phone calls and social network posts. This information is valuable for the companies and also for the users as data permits personalization in services. Nevertheless, some of this information is confidential.
Data privacy studies methods so that information can be used in a way that sensitive information is not disclosed. This project studies data privacy for big data, and it will develop algorithms to ensure data privacy, and approaches to evaluate disclosure risk.
