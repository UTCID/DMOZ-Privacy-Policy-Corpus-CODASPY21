Privacy
Breault Research Organization's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our contacts. We do not sell or share your information with other companies.
Breault.com includes forms for users who want to request information and provide comments, and we use Google tracking technologies to optimize our efforts to direct visitors to key pages of interest, such as inquiry forms. Breault.com forms ask users for their contact information (name, company name, address, phone number, email). Some of the requested information is required, some is optional. BRO uses this information to: 1) Contact users regarding their requests, and 2) Provide users with information regarding new products or services.
In addition to the use of tracking technologies to optimize forms for product and services inquiries, as described above, Breault.com may gather visitor information for the following uses: corporate marketing, remarketing and retargeting campaigns; website/visitor analytics; website optimization; customizing visitors' user experience; verifying access to customer portals and secure software download areas; and email subscription opt-in and subscription management.
