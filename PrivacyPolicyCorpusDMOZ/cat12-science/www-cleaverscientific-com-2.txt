1.4         If you are not a business customer, you are a consumer. Nothing in these terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer.
2.           Price

2.7         Business customers: At any time before delivery we may adjust the price to reflect any increase in our costs of supplying the goods.
3.           Delivery

3.2.2      if you cancel the contract, you can have no further claim against us under that contract.
3.3         If you accept delivery of the goods after the estimated delivery time, it will be on the basis that you have no claim against us for delay (including indirect or consequential loss, or increase in the price of the goods).
3.4         We may deliver the goods in instalments.  Each instalment is treated as a separate contract.
4            Delivery and safety
4.1         We may decline to deliver if:
