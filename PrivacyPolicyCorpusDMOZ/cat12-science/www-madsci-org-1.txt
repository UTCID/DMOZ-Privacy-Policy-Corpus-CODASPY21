MadSci's Privacy Policy
MadSci Network is a non-profit organization devoted to promoting
science literacy and encouraging an interest in science, both
at the K-12 level, and in the general population. All pages within
MadSci Network will have madsci.org or its IP address
as the server address, and no tilde (~) in the
path of the URL. Paths containing a tilde refer to home pages
of some scientists participating in the administration of the site.
When visiting MadSci Network we may record information regarding
the materials accessed. This information is not sold nor shared with
third parties, or make publically available, unless you enter specific
information on our ask-a-question form (see below).
All hits to and internal processes on madsci.org generate the following information in our server logs:
The Internet address, or IP# of your machine's Internet connection. Examples
include proxy-49.aol.com or 123.243.45.168.
The time and date at which you accessed the information.
The page or materials you are accessing.
The referring link you followed to get to the current page.
The type of browser and computer operating system that you use.
Any errors generated due to broken links or potential software errors.
We use this information in the following manner:
Generate monthly statistics regarding
traffic and usage, which may be included in proposals to obtain
funding for MadSci Network so we may keep it a free service.
Identify mistakes in files or trouble-shoot errors.
Identify high-usage materials that may be developed further to
provide additional, useful information.
Assist with the recruitment of scientists and moderators to review
and answer questions in high volume categories.
Make certain our materials and interfaces are accessible to
the platforms and browsers used by visitors.
Perform scientific research and analyses.
In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's
identified Internet Service Provider concerning any user who
abuses or attempts to interfere with the functioning of our site.
Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or
transfer personal information concerning visitors to our
website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required
by law.
In addition, many pages on our site link to
Google's
web search for non-profit organizations.
These search results are delivered by the site google.com, and will
redirect you to content on madsci.org unless you select the option
on Google's query form to search the entire WWW. MadSci.org is not
responsible for content located on other websites.
Please read Google's
Privacy Policy for how these transactions are handled.
Asking Questions
For individuals asking questions, we may record the following information:
A subject line and area of science must be entered on the form.
The following information is optional and not required to ask a question:
A first name
Email address
School or affiliated institution.
Location
Grade, or educational level.
If included, all components except the email address may be made
publiclly available in our online archives. Again, if you do not
wish this information to be publically accessible, please do
not fill in these areas.
MadSci Network participates in the Virtual
Reference Desk (VRD), an organization of volunteer librarians who
assist Internet patrons. MadSci forwards occasional questions
to the VRD, particularly those asking about where to find information,
how to use a library, or covering non-science topics.
The information you provide on our question form
will be forwarded to the VRD.
Information submitted on the ask-a-question form may be used in the following
manner(s):
Track the number of questions submitted in individual subjects. This
information helps us determine when we need to recruit additional
scientists to field questions, or whether specific subjects should be
added or removed from our existing list.
Perform scientific research and analyses regarding the educational level
of students submitting questions, and types of questions received.
Identify commonly asked questions, and create Frequently-Asked-Question
files (FAQs) to address them.
We will also use this information to trouble-shoot errors or problems in
our interfaces.
In addition, we may opt to supply this information to a user's identified
Internet Service Provider concerning any user who abuses our interfaces
or who submits materials that are rude, obnoxious, that contain expletives,
or threats of any sort.
Beyond these points, MadSci does not disclose, give, sell, or
transfer personal information concerning visitors to our
website unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required
by law.

US Federal Trade Commission.
