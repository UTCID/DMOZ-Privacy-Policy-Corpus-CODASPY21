Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize in writing to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Please note that you must verify your identity and authority related to your request before further action is taken. As a part of this process, government identification may be required. If you have authorized someone to make a consumer request for you, we will request proof of such authorization and/or a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification. We will verify their identity before acting upon the request or releasing your information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If an extension is needed for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.
