The ISEF마bstract form MUST막e used by Senior division students. There should not be an abstract section on the display board. Only the ISEF마bstract form may be used.
Junior division students are strongly recommended to use the ISEF abstract form. Elementary division students are encouraged to use the ISEF마bstract form. Junior and Elementary students can display the ISEF마bstract in addition to an abstract section on their display since their projects are often completed before they enter the Mercer Science and Engineering Fair.
