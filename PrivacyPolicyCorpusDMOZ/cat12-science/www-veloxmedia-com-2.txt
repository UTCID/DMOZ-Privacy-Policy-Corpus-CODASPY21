VELOX Media websites contain links to external, third party web sites along with relevant commentary to provide our visitors with information and content they are looking for.

A valid credit card is required to open an account on www.veloxmedia.com. The service is billed on a monthly basis in advance and is non-refundable. There will be no credits or refunds for partial months of service, or months unused with an open account. If you subscribe to any of the paid portions of the Services, you understand that once you have become a Subscriber, your subscription will be automatically renewed and your credit card will be charged based on the subscription program (e.g., annual, monthly, etc.) you have chosen. Payment is due on the defined recurring billing date. Service will be interrupted on accounts that reach 10 days past due.
CONTRACT TERMS
Search Engines ultimately choose which rankings are assigned to websites. While our practices have historically given our customers higher search rankings, no SEO provider including VELOX Media can guarantee rankings on search engines.
TERMINATION, CANCELLATION, & REACTIVATION POLICY
CANCELLATION REQUESTS ARE ACCEPTED BY WRITTEN NOTIFICATION ONLY, VIA EMAIL OR BY MAILING A HARD COPY TO VELOX MEDIA. CANCELLATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY UPON VELOX MEDIA’S RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST. CANCELLATIONS REQUESTED OVER THE PHONE ARE ONLY ACCEPTED WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY A WRITTEN CANCELLATION NOTICE, WHICH MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, BUSINESS NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, PHYSICAL OR MAILING ADDRESS, AND DOMAIN NAME. YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THESE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.
You are solely responsible for canceling your account by notifying your VELOX Media Client Success team in writing. Cancellation requests must be received at least ten (10) days before the account or product’s next renewal date. Upon cancellation, all of your data and stored information will be deleted immediately and cannot be restored. If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again. VELOX Media, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account, and immediate archival or deletion of all data in your account. VELOX Media reserves the right to refuse service to anyone in its sole and absolute discretion. In the event you choose to terminate services prior to completion of the contract term, Advertiser agrees to pay an early termination fee equal to one (1) full month’s fee. In the event collection proves necessary, the Advertiser agrees to pay all fees (including all attorney’s fees and court costs) incurred by that process. In the event that VELOX Media has built your website for you, you can transfer your domain name and website HTML to another service provider for $199, once you have completed the full term of your contract. All images and text on the site will remain the property of the Advertiser, but VELOX Media will retain ownership of the files and code on the site since these are proprietary to the website platform. The Boost Site Custom Website product may be reactivated (meaning the site will be published again onto the chosen domain) for no additional cost unless the domain subscription for the website has expired. If the domain subscription has expired, a reactivation fee of $200.00 will apply. Repurchase of a domain may be accommodated up to 30 days after the domain subscription expires (or a year and thirty days from the purchase of the original subscription). After the 30-day grace period, all website files will be retired and past clients desiring a website will need to order a new website. Once a customer’s domain has been allowed to expire, it may not be possible to obtain that exact domain again, in which case the purchase of a new domain must be arranged. A three day right of rescission applies to every client. This means that all clients may elect to cancel their account(s) without penalty within 3 days of the moment they pay for our products or services. All cancellation requests must be provided in writing.
