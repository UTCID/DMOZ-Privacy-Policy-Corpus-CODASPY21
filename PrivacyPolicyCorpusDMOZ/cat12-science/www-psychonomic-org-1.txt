PS Privacy Policy
See www.psychonomic.org/privatepolicy for more information.
This privacy policy applies to the PS Web site (www.psychonomic.org), together with all other Web sites operated by PS.
General Public
The portion of the PS Web site accessible to the general public will not expressly ask for information that personally identifies you or that allows the PS Web site to contact you.
Patient Information and Medical Disclaimer
Information posted on this Web site by PS should not be considered medical or psychological advice and is not intended to replace consultation or discussion with a licensed psychologist. It is very important that individuals with specific mental problems or questions consult with a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other health care professional. PS does not answer specific medical or mental health questions or offer referrals.
PS Members
The Psychonomic.org site requires you to provide certain personally identifiable information in order to use certain "Members" features and functions of the site. By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this privacy policy.
The Members only portion of the PS Web site (Members site) will expressly ask for your Web site identification and your password to access the Members site. The information that you provide to PS to become a Member during the PS member registration or renewal process (including name, address, phone and payment information, together with any additional information you provide to PS and information regarding the manner in which you use your PS membership) will not be processed or disclosed by PS except as permitted by this policy or as required or allowed by applicable law or legal process.
This information will be used to process your order and if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order. You agree and acknowledge that your order may be processed, fulfilled or serviced by third parties other than PS and you understand that such third parties are not limited by PS in their use of the information provided to them to process, fulfill or service your order. Therefore, in order to process, fulfill or service your order, you expressly consent to our sharing your information with any necessary third parties.
The Psychonomic Society use your contact information to get in touch with you regarding the status of your membership, registration or any orders you may place, for instance. You may also be contacted by us or our agents regarding additional services and features, or we may request your feedback about your experience with psychonomic.org. We also reserve the right to make your contact information available to third parties whose products and services you may find useful. If you prefer that we do not use your contact information as described here, you may send us an email at any time to info@psychonomic.org.
PS may share your information with carefully selected and screened organizations, including other associations, educational institutions, government agencies, corporate members, etc. These other organizations are not bound by this privacy policy, and you should contact them directly for information on their use of your data.
Personal Information
PS is committed to protecting the privacy of its members, customers and the public and will collect no personal information from you unless you choose to provide that information. If you purchase an PS product online, we collect personal information required to support the purchase of products, including names, addresses and e-mail addresses. When existing demographic information in our database is incorrect or incomplete, that information will be updated. PS only shares your personal information when necessary to complete your order (for example, your credit card and billing information is shared with our bank for authorization, and your delivery address is shared with our fulfillment center and shipper).
PS sends e-mails to let you know about changes to its Web site and communicate with you about issues that matter to psychological science, but we do not sell e-mail addresses to third parties. (But see above regarding our possible sharing of your contact information with selected third parties.)
Visit Information
When you visit the PS Web site, the Society's tracking agent automatically collects some basic information about your computer, including the following: your most recently visited URL, IP address (your computer's unique signature), operating system and browser software.
The information collected reflects the user population as a whole rather than focusing on individuals. It is used to better understand the people who visit psychonomic.org. This information allows PS to identify the most popular pages on the Web site. Aggregated data of non-personally identifiable information may be disclosed to the PS Governing Board to inform them of the number and categories of people who have visited the Web site.
Cookies
The PS Web site sends all visitors a cookie (small computer file) that contains a unique serial number that recognizes repeat users and facilitates ongoing access to and use of the Web site. PS does not use cookies to monitor the use of its Web site by individual users. Cookies do not collect personally identifying information; they collect information related to the characteristics of your computer, or when and how you reached the psychonomic.org site. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. They do not pose a threat to a user's system or files. Each time our Web server receives a request for a page, it checks to see if the cookie is present; this enables us to determine how much of our traffic is from repeat visitors. We use this information only for purposes of planning and tracking, as well as assessing the technical function of our site. By understanding how our site is accessed, we can continually improve it to respond to user's interests. Please note that cookies are necessary to enable PS members to use PS's member only information on the psychonomic.org site.
Psychonomic.org reserves the right to perform statistical analyses and profiling of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform third parties of such information. Psychonomic.org will provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties; no personally identifiable information will be disclosed.
Security and E-commerce
While information is critical to our ability to provide high quality service to you, our most important asset is the trust that our visitors place in how we provide that service. Keeping visitor information secure, and using it only as our visitors would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at PS. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, PS has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information collected online.
No Guarantee
Unfortunately, no information transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts, PS cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
Change of Policies
The Society may modify these policies at any time by posting revisions on psychonomic.org. Only the posted statement is effective with respect to current use of the site.

We invite your comments and questions about the psychonomic.org site, your experience with our site and services, and our privacy policy. Please contact us.
