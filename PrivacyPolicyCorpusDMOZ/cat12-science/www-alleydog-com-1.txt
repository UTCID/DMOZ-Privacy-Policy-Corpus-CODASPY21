Information Collected on
this Web Site

We may collect Personal
Information from users, for example, through such user's activities,
transactions and completion of surveys and other online forms on our Web Site.

may be required (although not all areas of our Web Site require registration).

address of your friend or family member to us, and such information will be
treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

third-party marketing list suppliers. We may use these lists to send direct
marketing promotions by e-mail. If you do not wish to receive future promotions
via e-mail, please follow the instructions in the Right to Opt In and

GIFs" (a/k/a "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar
technologies, on the Web Site and/or in our communications (e.g., in our
HTML-based e-mails) which enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page

our marketing campaigns.
IP Address and Clickstream

Any or all of these
activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our
behalf by our services providers.
How Personal Information is Used
We may use your Personal Information, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings (for example, to process your orders and respond to your requests and inquiries).

In addition, we may send you e-mail notices and offers and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such notices and offers from us, at any time, by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above

Third Party Offers
We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other third parties who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. Unless you instruct us not to do so, we may from time to time provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you such offers.

Legally Compelled Disclosures
We may disclose user information when compelled to do so by government authorities or otherwise as required or permitted by law, such as to respond to court orders and subpoenas.

Business Transfer
In the event that AlleyDog.com or all or a portion of its business, or one or more of its divisions, is acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.
Security
AlleyDog.com will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive Personal Information provided to us. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
If you contact us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Web Site, your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.
You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for protecting your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at support@alleydog.com.
