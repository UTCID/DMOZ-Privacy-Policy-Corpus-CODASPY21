Geoscience and Policy
As the national forum for the debate and development of cutting edge Earth science, the Geological Society has a special responsibility to communicate this science and its importance to society, the Government, the media, other scientific communities and the general public.
Our Policy Team engages with Parliament, Government, industry and academia to fulfil this purpose. Meet the team and find out how you can get in touch.
Get involved
In developing our consultation and inquiry responses, we are keen to have the input of as many Fellows as possible, with a range of perspectives and expertise relevant to the issue at hand.
If you would like to be notified by email when a consultation or inquiry opens, or if you would be interested in providing technical input for our policy briefing notes, please email policy@geolsoc.org.uk, or sign up to our database of expertise.
What we do
Our policy work aims to communicate technical geoscience information as and where it relates to public policy, to raise awareness of geoscience considerations in UK policymaking for the benefit of science, profession and society, and to seek out and maintain relationships with organisations both in the UK and around the world. Our core policy work centres on:
Communicating geological information to support evidence-based policy making
Communicating the value and importance of geoscientific knowledge and education
Supporting Fellows (members) in communicating their expertise and engaging with policy making
Hosting and attending policy-relevant meetings to foster relationships and connect with stakeholders
Communicating geological information to support evidence-based policy making
Responding to parliamentary inquiries from the House of Commons and House of Lords Select Committees
Responding to Government consultations launched by a number of departments, including the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs
Representing the geological community
Communicating the value and importance of geoscience knowledge
Collating, summarising and communicating state-of-the-art, relevant geoscientific information to policy makers, the media, the Government, Parliament, other scientists and the general public
Building and maintaining a database of expertise within the Society from which we can draw the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge
Forming independent advisory panels of experts to advise Government on specialist matters, such as the National Geological Screening for the geological disposal of radioactive waste
Writing and publishing policy documents and topical briefs on geoscience matters as they relate to relevant policy topics
Supporting Fellows in engaging with policy making
Keep up-to-date with our Policy activities by following us @GeolSoc on Twitter, or email us at policy@geolsoc.org.uk.
You can also sign up to our database of expertise – we will contact you when we need expert input on a range of geoscience topics as they relate to current policy work.
Get in touch to see how we can work with you!
Hosting and attending policy events to foster relationships and connect with stakeholders
Hosting discussion sessions and multi-disciplinary panels at our wide range of conferences, meetings and other events taking place at the Society annually
Representing the geoscience community at key events across the devolved nations of the UK
