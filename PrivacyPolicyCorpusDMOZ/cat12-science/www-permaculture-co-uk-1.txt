Changes to PolicyThis privacy policy was last updated MARCH 2020. Our privacy policy may change from time to time.

If the change materially affects registered users, we will send a notice to you by email, push notification or text.
Cookies policy for www.permaculture.co.uk
Permaculture.co.uk uses cookies. Cookies aren't, in fact, biscuits, but actually very small amounts of text that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. Almost every site on the web uses them, from Google to the BBC. They help make your visit a more enjoyable and secure experience - they allow us to remember if you are logged in to the website, and mean that we can avoid pestering you with promotions and requests to which you have already signed up.
We store no personally identifiable data in cookies - they are just a string of garbled numbers and letters - and they are not capable of harming your computer in any way.
Like most other sites on the web, we use Google Analytics to get an idea of how many people are visiting our site, from where, and what they read when they get here. It helps us make our articles more useful and interesting to you. The data that we receive back from Google is totally anonymised and contains no personal information.
Some of the companies that advertise on our site may track your browsing habits in order to show you more relevant adverts. You may choose to block this behaviour by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
So why are we telling you this? An EU directive means that regulations on cookies have been tightened up, and we wanted to be completely upfront with our readers about what is happening when you visit our website.
