Reasons to Buy Our Organic Seeds
Grown Without Synthetic Pesticides
Conventionally grown seeds come from plants that grew in the fields even longer than food crops and are likely to have had even more exposure to synthetic pesticides and fungicides to keep them viable as seed producers. Organic seeds are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides.
Certified Organic
Our Peaceful Valley brand vegetable seeds are CCOF & USDA Certified Organic, Non-GMO and Open-Pollinated (with the exception of hybrid seeds). You can be sure that the crops grown from our seeds are of the highest quality.
Guaranteed to Germinate
Our Peaceful Valley brand vegetable seeds are guaranteed to germinate! If they do not, just contact us and we'll be happy to replace them.
