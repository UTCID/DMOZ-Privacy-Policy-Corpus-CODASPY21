Privacy and security
At Oxfam, we rely on the generosity and support of private individuals like you to carry out our vital work to tackle poverty. That is why we want to be completely transparent about why we need the personal details we request when you support us and how we will use them.

When we will get in touch
When you give us your personal details - for example, when you make a donation, sign a petition, volunteer or campaign with us, sign up to receive email updates, support our "Tag Your Bag" scheme, or register for an event - you may receive follow up information from us directly relevant to this activity, including how your support is helping.If you have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our projects, fundraising activities and appeals, and other ways to support us. We may also send you occasional marketing letters where we think these are likely to be of interest, and where you purchase items from the Oxfam on-line shop we may send you emails about other relevant offers. We provide easy ways to stop our marketing, and you can opt out at any time.You, our supporters, really are the life-blood of Oxfam.

What details we ask for and why
There are minimum levels of information we need to obtain for different purposes - such as donating money or signing up to Gift Aid. We always ask for your name and title so we know how to talk to you. We may need to confirm transactions you make on the Oxfam GB website by sending you an email, which is why this field is sometimes mandatory. We will separately seek your permission to use this for our wider marketing communications.We may ask for your house number and postcode so that we hold a valid postal address for you. We might need this information for the following reasons:To set up Direct Debits and one-off card paymentsTo claim Gift AidTo deliver items to you (items you have purchased or event materials for example)If you have agreed to receive post from us, or we believe you may wish to hear from us in this way, we will also use your postcode and address to send you relevant information.In order to ensure that the data we hold about you is accurate and up to date, we may occasionally use information sources that are in the public domain to verify your details, such as your postal address.
Your data and social media
We may use your email address and phone number to match to your account on Facebook or other social media sites in order to show you Oxfam content while you are using these services. We will only do this where you have opted in to our marketing emails or phone calls, and your personal data is kept secure at all times. We may also use your email address and phone number to link to Facebook or other social media sites in order to identify other users of these sites whom we believe would be interested in Oxfam, and we may then show them Oxfam content.Information on how to stop this use of your data is given in our Privacy Policy.
Current and former Oxfam employees
When you leave Oxfam, Oxfam may process your data to respond to requests for employment references. In addition, OGB participates in the Inter-Agency Scheme for the Disclosure of Safeguarding-related Misconduct in Recruitment Process within the Humanitarian and Development Sector ('Scheme'). Where you apply for employment with another member of the Scheme, they will request a statement from Oxfam disclosing whether you have been found to have committed misconduct (in the form of sexual exploitation, sexual abuse or sexual harassment) while employed at Oxfam. Oxfam will respond to these requests in line with the rules of the Scheme.More details about the Scheme are available on the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response website.Find out more about Oxfam's assessment of the privacy impacts of participation in the Scheme.
