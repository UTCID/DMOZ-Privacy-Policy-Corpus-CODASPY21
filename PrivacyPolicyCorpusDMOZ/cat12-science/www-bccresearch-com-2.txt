Terms and Conditions
These Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") constitute an agreement between BCC Research, LLC ("BCC Research"), and you.
By clicking the "I Accept" button, placing an order for content or services or by creating an account, signing in via a web browser or mobile app or otherwise or accessing and/or using all or a portion of the Content or Services (defined below), you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the Terms, that the provisions, disclosures and disclaimers set forth in the Terms are fair and reasonable and that your agreement to follow and be bound by these terms and conditions is voluntary and not the result of fraud, duress or undue influence exercised upon you by any person or entity. If the Terms are considered an offer by you, BCC Research acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. Written approval is not a prerequisite to the validity or enforceability of the Terms.
For purpose of the Terms:
"Services" means the subscription portals and the services made available through access to and use of the one or more of BCC Research's web sites, including but not limited to bccresearch.com (collectively, the "Site").
"Content" means the reports, articles and other materials made available through the Services, including but not limited to, all charts, graphs, pictures and tables.
If your use of the Services or Content includes the registration by you of individuals in addition to yourself ("Other Registrants") you hereby represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such Other Registrants to the Terms.
By registering, you further represent and warrant to BCC Research that all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate, and that you will update such information as and when necessary to keep it accurate and up to date.
In addition, you agree that each use of the term "you" in the Terms will include you and each of such Other Registrants and that you shall be responsible for ensuring that each such Other Registrant complies with the Terms. If you are acting on behalf of an entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity and that you and each of the Other Registrants is an employee of such entity.
You agree further that each use of the term "you" in the Terms shall refer to such entity.
The definition of "Terms" shall include any terms describing additional obligations or restrictions accompanying your order of the Content or Services, including, without limitation, any payment obligations, specified Service period and usage restrictions.
If you are deemed to have ordered the Content or Services, BCC Research's acceptance is expressly conditional on your assent to the Terms to the exclusion of all other terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, if you have executed a separate written agreement with BCC Research that governs access to or use of the Content or Services, then the terms of such agreement and not these Terms shall govern and control.
If the Terms are considered an offer by you, BCC Research's acceptance is expressly limited to the Terms.
The Terms contain warranty disclaimers and other provisions that limit BCC Research's liability to you. Please read the Terms carefully and in their entirety. If you do not agree to be bound to each and every term and condition set forth herein, please do not use or access the Services.
By using the Content or Services, you hereby grant BCC Research permission to send you messages regarding the Content or Services, its features, service alerts, and network activity.
BCC Research reserves the right to modify the Terms from time to time with or without notice, and BCC Research will post the modified Terms at www.bccresearch.com or other interfaces through which you have ordered the Content or Services.
You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to familiarize yourself with any modifications.
With respect to such modified Terms, BCC Research may, at its sole discretion, require you to execute a "click accept" agreement incorporated into or as a condition of accessing Content or Services after initial delivery.
Even without such "click accept" agreement, your continued use of the Content or Services after such modifications will constitute your acknowledgement and agreement of the modified Terms.
If you do not agree to any changes in the Terms as they may occur, your continued right to access and use such Content or Services shall immediately terminate and you agree that you shall discontinue your use of the Content or Services. You agree that BCC Research is not liable to you or to any third party for any modification of the Terms or termination of your access to the Services except as specifically set forth herein.

All other rights in the free Content are reserved by BCC Research.
You may also purchase from the Site Content made available at a cost (the "Purchased Content").
The "Purchased Content may be available for download and use in certain specified formats, for example, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, or Adobe PDF. It is your responsibility to determine which format suits your needs best and which format will enable you to successfully receive and access any Purchased Content prior to your placement of an order.

store the Purchased Content in electronic format on the drive of one hardware device; and
print out one copy of the Purchased Content;

provided that you keep intact all and any copyright and proprietary notices on and within the Purchased Content and such New Material is accurate, fair and reasonable.
With Purchased Content, you may not:
assign your rights under the Terms;
offer the Purchased Content for resale or sublicense;
scan, photocopy, fax, or in any other way reproduce or copy the Purchased Content other than as permitted;

The Terms shall be effective as of the date you accept them or first access or use the Content or the Services (the "Effective Date") and shall remain in effect until such acceptance or access is terminated in accordance with these Terms.

The terms herein that contemplate obligations after termination, include but not limited to Indemnification, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Controlling Law and Severability, and Confidentiality, shall survive termination.

If you are an employer, you will not attempt to circumvent such limitation by permitting your employees or agents to share the same account regardless of whether such sharing occurs at different times.

The courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (state and federal) will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
The parties hereby waive all claims of immunity from such jurisdiction.
Venue for any action brought arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be in the State Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts or in the United States District Court for the District of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
For the purposes of the Terms: (a) the term "Dispute" will mean any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to: (i) the Terms, its interpretation, or the breach, termination, applicability or validity of the Terms; or (ii) any other dispute arising out of or relating to the relationship between BCC Research and you; (b) the term "Company Group" will mean BCC Research, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, beneficiaries, assignees, successors in interest, and any third party which provides products or services purchased from or distributed by BCC Research; and (c) the term "User Group" will mean you and those in privity with you, such as your affiliates, employees, partners, contractors, agents, family members and beneficiaries.

Company Group and User Group hereby forfeit their right to file and litigate a lawsuit in a court of law relating to any Dispute.
User Group understands that, in the absence of this paragraph, User Group would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court, including the right, if any and subject to the rules of User Group's jurisdiction, to litigate claims on a class-wide or class-action basis, and that User Group has expressly and knowingly waived those rights and agreed to resolve any Disputes through binding arbitration in accordance with the Terms.
This arbitration provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.
Company Group and User Group may each provide the other party with written notice of its intention to initiate arbitration with respect to any Dispute.

Any such Dispute will be resolved exclusively and finally by the AAA.
The AAA's Commercial Rules will govern the arbitration proceeding.
Company Group and User Group will agree upon another arbitration forum if AAA ceases all of its operations.
The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be limited solely to the Dispute between Company Group and User Group.
The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis.
Company Group and User Group will confer after service of written notice of arbitration to select a single agreed-upon arbitrator to adjudicate the Dispute.
If Company Group and User Group are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the AAA will assign an arbitrator.
Any decision or award rendered in such arbitration proceeding will be final and binding on Company Group and User Group, and judgment may be entered thereon only in the State or Federal courts in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
In the arbitration, the arbitrator will apply the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law principles.
The arbitrator will not have the right to award treble damages or punitive damages.
The location of the arbitration will be in Boston, Massachusetts, and the arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
