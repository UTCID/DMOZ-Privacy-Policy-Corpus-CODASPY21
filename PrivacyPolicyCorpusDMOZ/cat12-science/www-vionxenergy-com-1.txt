Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offering by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.1.2.       Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).1.3.       Google uses this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offering by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offering and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offering and internet usage in general. In this case, pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.1.4.       We use Google Analytics to display advertisements within Google and its affiliate advertising services, only those users who have shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in specific topics or products, based on the websites visited by them) that we submit to Google (so-called “remarketing” or “Google Analytics Audiences”).

This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement in the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA, upon which it will be shortened.1.6.       The IP address submitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google.

Integration of Services and Third-Party ContentBased on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) subpara. GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as videos or fonts (collectively referred to as “content”). This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content are aware of the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to the users’ browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavour to only use content from respective providers that use the IP address solely for the purposes of delivering said content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of access, and other information regarding the use of our online offering.The following provides an overview of third-party providers and their content, as well as links to their privacy policies, which contain further information on the processing of data and, as already mentioned in part, possibilities for objection (so-called opt-out):External fonts from Google, LLC., https://www.google.com/fonts (“Google Fonts”).
