If you hit this page then you may need to be dealing with the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) forms.
The ISEF forms are required for the Mercer Science and Engineering Fair in the Junior and Senior divisions. The Elementary division project DO NOT require any of these forms.
They are not required for other competitions like the Robot Design competition.
The blank ISEF Forms (PDFs) are available on the ISEF website. The ISEF Rules Wizard can be used to determine what forms are required for a particular project.
All projects must provide forms 1, 1a and 1b (*) along with a detailed research plan. All participants must provide an abstract as well.
Form 1 * - Adult and Student Checklist
Form 1a * - Student Checklist
Form 1b * - Project Approval
Form 1c - Regulated Research Institution
Form 2 - Qualified Scientist
Form 3 - Risk Assesment
Form 4 - Human Subjects
Consent Form (requires Form 4)
Form 5a - Vertebrate Animal
Form 5b - Vertebrate Animal research at Regulated Research Institution (requires Form 1c)
Form 6a - Potentially hazardous biological agents
Form 6b - Human, Vertabrate or Animal Tissue study
Form 7 - Project Continuation
As a reminder, most of these forms need to be filled in and signed BEFORE research and experimentation begin. Some are completed after this point. Please read the ISEF Rules for details.
