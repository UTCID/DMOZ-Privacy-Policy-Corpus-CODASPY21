About This Site
This website is dedicated to the
proposal that the metaphorical
relationships drawn between any
two disciplines are, in fact,
universal, being isomorphic
mathematical derivations of the
components of
the Unified Field Theory.
Further, that the
symmetry
of metaphor is extendible
both linearly and laterally,
allowing us
to mathematically predict
missing knowledge and invention
in all other
disciplines: an
interdisciplinary Rosetta stone
of universal scope.
A book describing this process
is in the works...
"The metaphor reminds us that
the universe is full of
cousins." - J.D. Casnig
