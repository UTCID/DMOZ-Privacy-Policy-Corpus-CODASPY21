Where am I ?
This is the Help Page for the following website:
http://www.agius.com/hew/
This is a World Wide Web site dealing
with
Occupational
and Environmental Health and Medicine, made available to you by the
author from his personal web domain.
However, other complementary resources
will also be available
in due course from the academic centre where the author works.
Why have I been presented
with an
error message ?
HTTP Error 404
The Web server cannot find the file or script you asked for. Here are
some suggestions:
Please check the URL to ensure that the path is correct.
Try deleting from the end of the URL ie delete from right
to left until
you get to a backslash </> then 'Enter'
Some of the pages may have their access restricted, at
least
temporarily,
for example if their contents are being reviewed by selected
peer-reviewers.
How do I search for more
information
on Occupational or Environmental Health ?
A range of  in-house ('home
grown')
resources listed
alphabetically are available.
Alternatively you can access the
Directory
of Sites in
Occupational and Environmental Health, and follow the Hypertext 'Links'
to hundreds of sites world-wide.
The resources are also presented in a
different way as Frequently
Asked Questions about Health, the Environment & Work.
You can also use the search
facility
The page does not look
updated -
I expected it to be different.
Try clicking on 'Reload' in your browser. Perhaps an
older
version has
been cached.
Alternatively it may simply be waiting its turn for an
update (see the
next question below).
You may use a facility such as Mind-It
to alert you automatically when a page that you are interested in has
been
amended.
Why does the site need
a background?
Some webmasters have constructed their websites with
'frames' in which
the resources of 'Health, Environment and Work' (HEW) are then invoked
through hypertextlinks. This may give the impression that HEW resources
belong to another website or are somehow in common with it. By using a
background image, the independent identity of  'Health,
Environment
and Work' can be highlighted.
However if this still bothers you, some browsers
permit
you to customise
your preferences easily to get rid of or substitute your own
backgrounds
and colours. For example in Netscape you can do this by clicking on
Edit
> Preferences> Appearance> Colors.
Can you email me with/
publish
more information on ...?
Unfortunately it is usually not possible to respond to
individual requests
but the following suggestions may help you:
Try using the search
facility
(read the search tips first). 'Search'
reports
are regularly reviewed and if certain terms or keywords recur then more
information on that topic may be published in due course if it is
feasible
to do so.
Alternatively if you have not found what you want by
searching this
site, you may try searching using other
engines.
Submit your query or suggestion through the feedback
form.
What if I (or someone I
know) have
a personal problem regarding ill-health from a possible Occupational or
Environmental Cause ?
Unsolicited e-mail asking for medical
advice
is unlikely
to be answered. You should seek clinical advice from your medical
practitioner. Problems
may arise in providing email consultations or advice on personal
concerns
about health. The doctor will not know the patient's full details,
especially
as regards the findings from a physical examination as well as other
sources
of information. Moreover there would be no provision for monitoring or
follow up care. (Advice adapted from the General
Medical Council.)
The author invests his free time in
maintaining this site,
but regrets that he is usually too busy to respond to queries or to
acknowledge
them individually.
What are the credentials for
this site?
The author
is a University
academic (Professor of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the University
of Manchester) and a registered medical practitioner (doctor) with
specialist certification in Occupational
Medicine.
Although all the pages are published
in
good faith - please
see the disclaimer and copyright notice.
This website is completely self funded
by the author.
As the logo on the Health, Environment & Work Home Page
shows the site has been accredited by Health on the Net
Academics undertake research the results of which are
disseminated
through 'peer' mechanisms and which take time to influence the health
and
well being of the public at large and the findings might not be
directly
accessible to the public. Academics also teach the professional
practitioners
of tomorrow and help them in their learning. The public benefits from
this
as well - but the benefits take time to percolate, and the 'knowledge'
may well be stored in expensive books, or password protected resources.
The World Wide Web presents a valuable opportunity to provide
'stakeholders'
with a free summary digest of some aspects of the 'knowledge'and the
'practice'
in relation to Health, Environment and Work.
What
is the policy of this site in relation to confidentiality, privacy,
security etc?
This website is intentionally kept simple, and does not place
any cookies on the computers of surfers, nor collect information from
them.
The website does not contain a secure information eg passwords
/ identities etc and has no personal information in any database or
other form.  Hence there is nothing  worth hacking into.
Any email addresses provided in the feedback form are sent by
email to the site owner and not kept on the site, not 'sold' nor used
for any commercial purpose.
No personal. medical nor other similar informaion is sought by
nor stored on this site.
This site undertakes to honour or exceed the
legal, professional, and ethical  requirements for medical / health
information privacy prevailing in Great Britain.
What
is
the policy of this site regarding advertising?
This site does not accept
advertising, and is not funded by advertising nor sponsorship.
Unsolicited invitations for
exchanging links are likely to be ignored.  Links to other sites
are provided, based on the merits of those sites and their consistency
with the aims of this one, and not on an exchange basis.
Since the author is involved,
through work, with other internet based activities related to
occupational and environmental health, and this interest is declared,
there will often be cross-links between this website and the academic one at the University
of Manchester.
If you can't find the guidance you
need
on this help page...
Read the page carefully, and if you're still stuck,
you
may wish to
use the feedback form.
