TLS Record LayerAt the bottom layer of the TLS protocol is the TLS
record layer. The record layer sends blocks of data, called
records , between the client and the server. Each block can
contain up to 16,383 bytes of data. Quoting from the original SSL
specification and RFC 2246, “Client message boundaries are not
preserved in the record layer.” This means that if higher-level
processes send multiple messages very quickly, those messages may be
grouped together into a single record. Alternatively, they might be
broken into many records—and they will be broken if they’re longer
than 16,383 bytes.Each TLS record contains the following information:Content typeProtocol version numberLengthData payload (optionally compressed and encrypted)Message Authentication Code (MAC)[229]Each record is compressed and encrypted according to the current
compression algorithm and encryption algorithm. At the start of the
connection, the compression function is defined as
CompressionMethod.null and the encryption method
is TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL—that is, there is no compression or
encryption. Both the compression and encryption algorithms can be set
during the “Hello” and changed during the course of the
conversation.The
MAC is calculated using the formula:HMAC_hash( MAC_write_secret, seq_num + TLSCompressed.type + TLSCompressed.version +
TLSCompressed.length + TLSCompressed.fragment))where:seq_num is the sequence number for the
message.HMAC_hash( ) is the hashing algorithm. HMAC is a keyed MAC function ...
