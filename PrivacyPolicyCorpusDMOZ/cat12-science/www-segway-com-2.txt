PRIVACY POLICY & LEGAL
Date of Last Revision: April 19, 2019
Privacy Statement
Protecting your privacy is one of Segway Inc.’s (“Segway”) top priorities. This statement discloses the information practices for Segway’s web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. By visiting www.segway.com and its respective subdomains, collectively “the Site,” you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as modified from time to time by us.
Personal Information We Collect:
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically collected information as “Device Information”.
Registration, Interactive Forms, and User Content
www.segway.com: A user may wish to register on www.segway.com to receive informational and promotional email materials such as newsletters, product release announcements and participate in surveys. Users may also use a form to submit feedback to our site or to contact us.For ordinary users, only a name and email address is requested for these interactions. For business users, we also request additional information about the business, including the company name, address, and phone number. All such contacts and registrations are voluntary on the part of the user; therefore, the user has a choice as to whether or not to disclose this information.
Customer Request
If you request something from Segway, such as service, a callback, specific marketing materials, or feedback, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share relevant information with others such as shipping carriers, product orientation providers, and marketing advisors. We may also contact you as a part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.
Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”.
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
Cookies
A “cookie” is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computer and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser, if your browser’s preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies stored on your computer by other sites.Segway uses cookies to store your user ID on your computer, allowing use of interactive areas on our Site. The cookie is placed on your computer only when you log into interactive sections of our Site and is removed once you have closed your web browser.You can configure your web browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). You may reject all cookies sent to you without experiencing any loss of web site functionality.
How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:

When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
Additionally, we may use your Personal Information to communicate with you about new products, special offers, marketing or promotion, or other information which we think you may find interesting.
