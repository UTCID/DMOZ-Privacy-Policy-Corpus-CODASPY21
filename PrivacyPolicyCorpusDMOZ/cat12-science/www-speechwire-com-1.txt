Privacy and Security PolicyThis Privacy and Security Policy is provided for the benefit
of customers and clients of SpeechWire Tournament Services (“SpeechWire”) as
well as other consumers and parties who seek information from or about
SpeechWire and/or its website(s), particularly speechwire.com (“Website” or
“speechwire.com”) (collectively, “SpeechWire Services”).
1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  OPENING
STATEMENTS
1.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Definitions.
Across its various policies, applications, and Website, SpeechWire strives to
use the same definitions for particular terms. By doing so, SpeechWire seeks to
make its policies and governing documents consistent and user-friendly. For
this reason, SpeechWire provides the definitions for these terms in one
location and directs you to our Terms of Use for such definitions. Additionally,
any use of “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to SpeechWire as an entity.
1.2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Our
Commitment to Privacy.Â  At SpeechWire, we
respect the privacy and the confidentiality of our customers’ information,
particularly our customers’ PII (also commonly referred to as personally
identifiable information) (“PII”). We are committed to keeping confidential the
PII you share with us. This Privacy and Security Policy explains how SpeechWire
collects, uses, discloses and protects the information we obtain.
1.3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Applicability
of Privacy and Security Policy.Â  Our
Privacy and Security Policy applies to all individuals and entities from whom
or for the benefit of whom we receive PII, whether it be collected through our
websites; traditional mailing and/or faxing channels; telephone or electronic
communications; from some other medium; and/or from our clients.
1.4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Website Not
Directed to Minors.Â  An individual must
be aged thirteen (13) or over to create an account or an SMS/email subscription
through the Website. As such, the Website is not directed toward children or
minors.
2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  PERSONAL
INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED
2.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Personally
Identifiable Information or PII is any information that would, by itself or in
combination, identify you or tend to identify you as a particular individual or
entity. This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name, your address,
credit card number, bank account information, and/or personal identification
number (such as a social security number or driver’s license number).
2.1.1Â Â Â Â Â  PII does not
include any public information that is readily attainable through federal,
state or local public record distribution channels.
2.1.2Â Â Â Â Â  PII does not
include any information that, by itself or in combination, could not identify
you as a particular individual or entity.
2.1.3Â Â Â Â Â  PII also
does not include raw data that becomes aggregated for statistical purposes and
cannot, thereafter, be identified with you as a unique individual or entity.
2.1.4Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
does consider your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to be PII and will treat it
as such.
2.2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Information
Collected
2.2.1Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
collects information that is considered PII and other information that, by
itself, would not be considered personally identifiable information
(“Non-PII”).
2.2.2Â Â Â Â Â  When you
create an account and register for any of our SpeechWire Services (whether
through a Website or other portal), we collect information submitted by you
including, but not limited to, your username, your full name, company name (if
applicable), school name, physical address, email address, telephone number,
zip code, and any additional information provided by the account holder that
could identify that account holder. We use this information to identify our
customers and send notifications related to the use of our SpeechWire Services.
We reserve the right to request additional information from you.
2.2.3Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
may also collect information to one or more of your financial accounts for
purposes of processing payments to provide you with SpeechWire Services.Â  This information may likely contain both PII
and Non-PII.
2.3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Collecting
and Using Personally Identifiable Information
2.3.1Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
will explain how it intends to use PII either before it collects the
information (such as in this Privacy and Security Policy) or contemporaneously
with the solicitation of such information. Exceptions may exist where the
intended use is obvious to a reasonable person.
2.3.2Â Â Â Â Â  We will use
the PII collected only for the purposes explained to you. Further, we limit the
collection of PII to only that information which is necessary for the purposes
explained to you.
2.3.3Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
may make public the name, contact information, and/or other information of or
about Tournament Managers in the normal course of operations to provide coaches
and/or other consumers with information about the events that Tournament
Managers are running using SpeechWire Services.
2.3.4Â Â Â Â Â  We use the
PII collected and/or received about you in connection with our Website, Website
Services, SpeechWire Services, and their various features. We also use
information collected and/or received about you in connection with other users.
For example, we may use the information we receive about you
(a) as part of our efforts to keep SpeechWire safe and secure; (b) to provide
SpeechWire Services; (c) to make suggestions to you and other users on
SpeechWire; and (d) to provide support. Additionally, we may use aggregated
information derived from PII to improve the SpeechWire Services and any related
matters thereto.
Granting us this permission, by submitting PII and other
data, not only allows us to provide SpeechWire as it exists today, but it also
allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in
the future that use the PII we receive about you in new ways.
2.3.5Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire,
Tournament Managers using SpeechWire Services to administer their tournaments,
Tournament Staff, and league or association administrators may use your PII to
communicate with you for the foregoing and other reasons by email, text
message, phone call, or other electronic, written or oral communication method,
unless you expressly indicate to SpeechWire not to use a particular method of
communication.Â  Such indication may
result in the removal of information regarding such a method of communication
from your Customer account or the removal of your Customer account.
2.3.6Â Â Â Â Â  Your
submission of PII and other data on this website represents your granting of
permission to share that information with Tournament Managers, Tournament
Staff, SpeechWire's Strategic Partners, and/or league or association
administrators in the normal course of providing SpeechWire Services, such as
for the purposes of running tournaments. At the same time, you continue to own,
and always own, all of your PII. Your trust is important to us, which is why we
do not share PII we receive about you with others unless we have: (a) received your
permission; (b) given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this
policy; or (c) removed your name and any other PII from it.
By submitting your PII and other data using this service,
you acknowledge that Tournament Managers, Tournament Staff, or league or
association administrators using SpeechWire Services may contact you using
those methods.Â  Managers may share with
the public, or request that SpeechWire share with the public, data that you
provide on this website. That data could include, but is not limited to, the
public posting of tournament schedules or results of tournaments, which may
contain the information described in Section 2.3.7 below.
2.3.7Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
users may submit information to SpeechWire about students and other persons for
purposes of managing their teams, so that Tournament Managers and Tournament
Staff may facilitate operation of tournaments, festivals or other competitions
and events. The information submitted may include, but is not limited to,
students' or other person's names, competition codes or identifiers, school
affiliations, year in school, and information about the selection a student or
other person will perform at an event. This information may be shared with
other persons or publicly released by the Tournament Manager, Tournament Staff,
or league or association administrators.
This student information may also be shared publicly by
SpeechWire at the request of one of those aforementioned individuals as part of
their use of SpeechWire Services. Such releases may include, but are not
limited to: the release of results following the event; postings of event
schedules/schematics/competition orders/pairings/etc. before, during, or after
an event; and lists of participants in an event. This information may be stored
indefinitely on media or computers owned by SpeechWire or its Strategic
Partners.
If you submit information about students or other
individuals using the SpeechWire Website or other SpeechWire Services, you
affirm that you possess the authorization to include the names of and any
associated information about the individuals hereby submitted, and you affirm
that you are aware of the ways that SpeechWire uses that information to
facilitate events run by tournament managers using SpeechWire Services and that
these practices are permissible under applicable laws.
2.3.8Â Â Â Â Â  Unless we
are required to do so by law, we shall not obtain your consent before
collecting PII about you from other parties. Rather, SpeechWire shall presume
that you have previously provided such consent to any such third party from
whom SpeechWire obtains such information.
2.3.9Â Â Â Â Â  In the
normal course of its business operations, SpeechWire restricts the use of and
access to your PII to SpeechWire’s personnel, its Strategic Partners, Tournament
Managers, league or association managers, and Tournament Staff, except where
that information has been released as described in this Privacy and Security
Policy.
2.3.10Â Â Â  We shall not
sell your PII in the normal course of business operations. Should all or any
part of SpeechWire’s business operations be sold, this paragraph shall not
restrict the transfer of your PII as part of the Website sold to a third party.
2.3.11Â Â Â  SpeechWire
will not use information submitted about students to build a profile about them
for the purposes of targeting them with advertisements.
2.3.12Â Â Â  We may also
use the PII you provide in registering with and using SpeechWire to inform you
by electronic mail, phone, text or other communication method of additional
products and services about which you might be interested, which may include
our periodic e-newsletters and other promotional communications from
SpeechWire.
2.4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Disclosing
Personal Information
2.4.1Â Â Â Â Â  We do not
share with others PII we obtain from your use of our SpeechWire Services,
except as described in this Privacy and Security Policy and the Terms of Use.
2.4.2Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
may use PII in the normal course of providing the SpeechWire Services; to
operate or improve the Website and/or SpeechWire Services; to outsource certain
services to Strategic Partners; to complete a transaction that has been
requested; to develop aggregate information; and/or as otherwise disclosed to
you.
2.4.3Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
may provide PII to other persons where (a) we have your consent; (b) the
disclosure is necessary to complete a transaction requested; (c) we have
obtained information from a third party; (d) we are required or permitted to do
so by law; (e) the Website and/or SpeechWire Services are used in a manner that
violates the Terms of Use or are used for purposes other than those for which
they were specifically intended; or (f) the terms of this Privacy and Security
Policy and/or the Terms of Use otherwise permit and/or provide for such
disclosure.
2.4.4Â Â Â Â Â  Strategic
Partners. SpeechWire may employ, engage or retain certain trusted third parties
(“Strategic Partners”) to perform functions and/or provide services on its
behalf. SpeechWire will share PII with these Strategic Partners only to the
extent necessary to perform the functions and/or provide the services for which
they have been employed, engaged or retained.
2.4.5Â Â Â Â Â  Business
Transfers. SpeechWire reserves the right to sell, transfer or otherwise share
stored PII in connection with a sale of assets; a merger, acquisition, or
reorganization; or filing for bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt
out of any such transfer if the planned processing of your information by the
purchaser differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy and Security
Policy.
2.4.6Â Â Â Â Â  Legal
Compliance. SpeechWire may disclose any information about you and/or Content
created by you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as
we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to: (1) comply
with an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory agency, and/or
other governmental authority; (2) respond to claims, court orders, or other
legal process (including subpoenas); (3) to enforce the terms of this and other
SpeechWire agreements as well as to protect the property and rights of
SpeechWire, its Strategic Partners or other third parties; (4) to protect, in
SpeechWire’s sole discretion, the public or any person from harm; (5) to
investigate, prevent, stop, or take other action regarding any action perceived
to be fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable in SpeechWire’s
sole discretion; or, generally, (6) to comply with the law.
2.4.7Â Â Â Â Â  Notice.
Unless restricted from doing so, SpeechWire will attempt to notify you before
it releases any of your PII or Content pursuant to (1) and (2) in Paragraph
2.4.6 only. In such cases, SpeechWire will also provide you with general
information on how you may seek to block such a release of information and/or
direct you to resources that can provide such general information. The
provision of such general information to you is not and should not be construed
as providing you with legal advice. Additionally, SpeechWire is under no other
obligation to assist you in challenging or opposing a release of your
information.
2.5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Non-Personally
Identifiable Information.Â  In addition to
collecting PII as previously described, SpeechWire also collects other
non-PII.Â  Non-PII collected by SpeechWire
may be utilized without restriction.Â
Although non-PII can be used in a number of ways, you can be assured
that the use of the non-PII cannot identify you as a particular
individual.Â  Because non-PII cannot be
used to identify you, SpeechWire may in its discretion provide non-PII to other
persons or entities.
2.6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Information
Obtained from Use of SpeechWire’s Websites
2.6.1Â Â Â Â Â  We do not
share with others information we obtain from your use of our SpeechWire’s
Websites, except as described in this Privacy and Security Policy and the Terms
of Use.
2.6.2Â Â Â Â Â  Cookies.
Cookies can be defined as bits of data stored on your
computer that allow websites to identify your browser and session.
Most web browsers automatically accept and collect cookies.
However, most browsers also allow you to configure them to accept all cookies,
reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.Â  Depending upon your web browser’s security
settings, you may have the ability to reject all cookies. If you reject all
cookies, you may not be able to use the SpeechWire Services or products that
require you to “sign in” and you may not be able to take full advantage of all
offerings.
The SpeechWire Website may use its own cookies for a number
of purposes including, but not limited to:
A.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Requiring
you to re-enter your password after a certain period of time has elapsed to
protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents;
B.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Keeping
track of preferences specified by our users while using the SpeechWire Website;
C.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Estimating
and reporting our total audience size and traffic; and

research to improve the content and services provided on the SpeechWire
Website.

no control over the use of cookies by our Strategic Partners. For information
on how these third parties utilize cookies collected, you should examine their
respective privacy policies.
2.6.3Â Â Â Â Â  Browser and
Session Information.Â  SpeechWire may
collect information about your browser and session at the Website and/or using
the Website Services.
2.6.4Â Â Â Â Â  IP Addresses
SpeechWire may maintain a log of Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses when any company-owned computers, servers, and/or websites
(including, the Website) have been accessed. An IP address by itself does not
allow us to collect additional PII about you.
IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:
A.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Diagnose
and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers
that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company
or ISP;
B.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Estimate
the total number of users visiting a SpeechWire computer, server and/or website
from specific geographical regions.
C.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Help
determine which users have access privileges to certain content, services or
resources offered; and,
D.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Monitor
and prevent fraud and abuse.
2.7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Data
Retention
2.7.1Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain storage of information
subject to the terms of this Privacy and Security Policy and the Terms of Use.
2.7.2Â Â Â Â Â  The length
of time for which SpeechWire retains PII and other information will vary
depending on the nature of the services for which the information has been
collected and the nature of the information.
2.7.3Â Â Â Â Â  Although
this period of retention may extend beyond the end of your relationship with
SpeechWire, it will be retained for only so long as necessary for SpeechWire to
respond to any issues arising from your relationship with SpeechWire. Data that
you provide using SpeechWire services may be retained beyond the end of your
relationship with SpeechWire so as to provide services to Tournament Managers,
Tournament Staff, or league or association administrators to support their
tournaments that may run using SpeechWire Services. Data including, but not
limited to, data about participation at events, schedules of events and results
of events, which may include data submitted by you, may be retained
indefinitely.
2.7.4Â Â Â Â Â  When
SpeechWire no longer needs or requires your personal information, SpeechWire
will destroy, delete, erase or convert information to an anonymous form without
notice to you.
2.7.5Â Â Â Â Â  Depending on
the package of services purchased, SpeechWire may delete information including,
but not limited to, stored messages, interviews, videos, audio, other content,
and records of your account without notice to you. SpeechWire recommends that
you back up on your own computer any critical and important information prior
to allowing your SpeechWire Services to terminate or expire.
2.7.6Â Â Â Â Â  Should your
account be terminated, SpeechWire may immediately and permanently delete all
stored messages, interviews, videos, audio, other content, and records of your
account without notice to you.
3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  CONSENT
3.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
may obtain personal information about you through a variety of sources. For
each source or method, the manner of consent may differ.
3.2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In general,
SpeechWire operates on an “Opt-out” basis. That is, SpeechWire presumes that by
using its SpeechWire Services and/or accessing its Website you have read this
Privacy and Security Policy and SpeechWire’s Terms of Use. Moreover, by
providing the personal information requested (both personally identifiable and
non-personally identifiable), you have consented to its use by SpeechWire for
the stated purposes.
3.3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For these
reasons, unless and until you expressly inform SpeechWire you do not wish your
information to be used, SpeechWire shall presume it has your consent.
3.4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Where
SpeechWire obtains information about a consumer from its customers or other
third parties, SpeechWire presumes that the consumer has previously provided
appropriate consent to the party from whom SpeechWire obtains the information.
In any case, the consumer can be assured that this Privacy and Security Policy
applies to any information obtained from a third party.
4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ACCESS

certain limitations imposed by applicable privacy laws, you may request that

requests for access to information should be directed to the contact
information provided below.
4.3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We will
make every effort to respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe.

6.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RESERVED.
7.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SECURITY
7.1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SpeechWire
takes the issue of protecting your anonymity and personal information very
seriously. SpeechWire protects the information it obtains about you with
appropriate, commercially reasonable safeguards and security measures
consistent with standard information practices. These measures include
commercially reasonable technical and procedural steps to protect your data
from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or
destruction.
7.2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For security
purposes, SpeechWire does not disclose all of its security measures. Be assured
that SpeechWire does employ commercially reasonable industry standard measures
to protect your information.
8.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RESERVED.
9.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DISCLAIMER
AS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
