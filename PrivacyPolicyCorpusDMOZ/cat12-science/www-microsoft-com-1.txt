Falcon: Honest-Majority Maliciously Secure Framework for Private Deep Learning
June 2021
by Sameer Wagh; et. al.
We propose Falcon, an end-to-end 3-party protocol for efficient private training and inference of large machine learning models. Falcon presents four main advantages – (i) It is highly expressive with support for high capacity networks such as VGG16 (ii) it supports batch normalization which is important for training complex networks such as AlexNet (iii) Falcon guarantees security with abort against malicious adversaries, assuming an honest majority (iv) Lastly, Falcon presents new theoretical insights for protocol…

Hardware-Software Contracts for Secure Speculation
May 2021
by Marco Guarnieri; et. al.
Since the discovery of Spectre, a large number of hardware mechanisms for secure speculation has been proposed. Intuitively, more defensive mechanisms are less efficient but can securely execute a larger class of programs, while more permissive mechanisms may offer more performance but require more defensive programming. Unfortunately, there are no hardware-software contracts that would turn this intuition into a basis for principled co-design. In this paper, we put forward a framework for specifying such contracts,…

A Security Model and Fully Verified Implementation for the IETF QUIC Record Layer
May 2021
by Antoine Delignat-Lavaud; et. al.
We investigate the security of the QUIC record layer, as standardized by the IETF in draft version 30. This version features major differences compared to Google’s original protocol and prior IETF drafts. We model packet and header encryption, which uses a custom construction for privacy. To capture its goals, we propose a security definition for authenticated encryption with semi-implicit nonces. We show that QUIC uses an instance of a generic construction parameterized by a standard…

KARD: Lightweight Data Race Detection with Per-Thread Memory Protection
April 2021
by Adil Ahmad; et. al.
Finding data race bugs in multi-threaded programs has proven challenging. A promising direction is to use dynamic detectors that monitor the program’s execution for data races. However, despite extensive work on dynamic data race detection, most proposed systems for commodity hardware incur prohibitive overheads due to expensive compiler instrumentation of memory accesses; hence, they are not efficient enough to be used in all development and testing settings. KARD is a lightweight system that detects data…

Developing Secure Systems Summit – Online Seminar Series: Fall 2020
Upcoming: December 16, 2020
The Developing Secure Systems Summit (DS3) is meant to be an inclusive event, building on several existing communities to forge its identity. On the one hand, we aim to reach out to the security research community that congregates at flagship events like IEEE Security and Privacy, the USENIX Security Symposium, and the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security. Equally, we seek to connect with the open source and industrial software security community that gathers…

Research Intern – Privacy and Cryptography
December 10, 2020
The Cryptography and Privacy Research Group at Microsoft Research seeks graduate students in applied cryptography and privacy for spring and summer internships. Topics of particular interest to us include (but are not limited to) secure computing (FHE, MPC, TEE), ML privacy, end-to-end encryption, web privacy and security, post-quantum cryptography, and zero-knowledge proof. We offer internship projects ranging from protocol design and security analysis to crypto and privacy engineering, so we encourage PhD students with any…

De-Identifying Healthcare Data for Research
December 8, 2020
In order to meet HIPAA privacy guidelines for secondary use such as research and analytics, the healthcare data needs to be de-identified. HIPAA defines Protected Health Information (PHI) and proposes two methods for de-identifying data. FHIR Tools for anonymization, an open source tool developed by the HealthNext team, implements foundational capability for de-identifying FHIR data using different methods. This tool comes with a default configuration that is aligned with HIPAA safe harbor method of de-identification.…

Your Threat Model is Bad and You Should Feel Bad
December 1, 2020
This presentation will explain how to create bad threat models (just keep doing what you’re doing), why abstractions are the work of the devil (and a necessary evil), and what happens when processor flaws meet traditional software exploitation (nothing good). I will illustrate my arguments with stick figures and an explanation of our recent BlindSide attack.
