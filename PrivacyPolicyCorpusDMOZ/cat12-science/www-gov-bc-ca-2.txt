Legal changes of name
Covid-19 update - Many fingerprinting agencies have now reopened.  However , before beginning  your change of name application, contact your local RCMP/Police department or accredited fingerprinting agency to ask if fingerprinting/criminal record check services are available at this time.
Changing your name is an important decision that can have far-reaching effects on your personal and business relationships. If you were born in Canada, a legal change of name also changes the name on your birth record. It’s important to understand the steps required in a legal name change, the cost, and the effect it will have on your life.
Legal Change of Name Application
This section contains information about who can apply for a legal change of name, what steps are required, and what documentation you need to submit with your application.
Certificate of Change of Name
The Certificate of Change of Name is the document you will show whenever you are asked for proof of your legal change of name. For instance, you will need to produce this when changing your name on your driver’s licence.
How to Apply for a Change of Name
Adults (19+) applying without children can apply online and pay with credit card. Access to a printer is required to use this option.
Online Services
All other applicant can apply by completing Application For Change of Name
Your Surname after Marriage
After marriage, you can choose to continue using your own surname (last name), or you can start using your spouse's surname. Assuming your spouse's surname does not constitute or require a legal change of name under the Name Act.
If after assuming a spouse’s surname after marriage you decide to go back to using your own surname, you can do this at any time without a legal change of name.
Legislation
The policies and procedures for completing a legal change of name in British Columbia follow legislation set out in the Name Act.
