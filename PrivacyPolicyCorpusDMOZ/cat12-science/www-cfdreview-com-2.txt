CFD Review Terms of Service
Thank you for visiting cfdreview.com, a Viable Computing site.
1. Acceptance of terms
Viable Computing provides the information and services on CFD Review to you,
the user, conditioned upon your acceptance, without modification, of the
terms and conditions of use ("Terms") contained herein. Your use of
CFD Review constitutes agreement with such Terms.
Before using CFD Review, please carefully read this agreement relating to
your use of CFD Review. By using CFD Review, you agree to be bound by
these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and
conditions, please do not use CFD Review.
Viable Computing reserves the right, at Viable Computing's sole discretion,
to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms periodically.
Such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the
modified agreement to the website unless provided otherwise (e.g.,
when implementing major, substantive changes, Viable Computing intends
to provide users with up to fourteen days of advance notice). Your
continued use of CFD Review following the posting of changes to these
Terms will mean that you accept those changes.
Use of CFD Review constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the Terms;
if a user does not accept Viable Computing's Terms, he or she is not granted
rights to use CFD Review as defined herein, and should refrain from
accessing CFD Review.
Viable Computing reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, CFD Review
(or any part thereof). Viable Computing shall not be liable to any user
or other third party for any such modification, suspension or
discontinuance except as expressly provided herein.
2. No unlawful or prohibited use
By using CFD Review, you warrant to Viable Computing that you will not use
CFD Review, or any of the content obtained from CFD Review, for any
purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. If you violate any
of these Terms, your permission to use CFD Review automatically terminates.
3. Description of services
CFD Review is owned and operated by Viable Computing for the purpose of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) discussion, implementation and innovation
(the "Purpose"). CFD Review provides CFD news, support,
and education for the engineering community.
4. Registration obligations
When requested, each CFD Review user must: (1) personally provide true,
accurate, current and complete information on CFD Review's registration
form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (2) maintain and promptly
update the Registration Data as necessary to keep it true, accurate,
current and complete. If, after investigation, Viable Computing has
reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue,
inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Viable Computing may suspend or
terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future
use of CFD Review (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as
expressly provided herein.
Each user will receive passwords and account designations upon completing
certain CFD Review registration processes and is wholly responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all
activities occurring thereunder. Viable Computing cannot and will not be
liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply with
this Section 4, including any loss or damage arising from any user's
failure to: (1) immediately notify Viable Computing of any unauthorized
use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security;
and (2) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end
of each session.
Viable Computing handles user Registration Data in accordance with the
CFD Review Privacy Policy.
5. Content
All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics,
video, messages, or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, "Content"),
whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility
of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that the user,
and not Viable Computing, is entirely responsible for all Content that he
or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via CFD Review. No user
shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities
on CFD Review that, in the judgment of Viable Computing, is likely to be
prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing
the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of
obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual property.
Viable Computing reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which
it becomes aware and reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose. In addition,
Viable Computing shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole
discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably considers to
violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal. Viable Computing, in its sole
and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content
if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as
reasonably determined useful by Viable Computing to protect the rights,
property, or personal safety of CFD Review's users and the public. Viable
Computing does not control the Content posted to CFD Review and, as such,
does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.
Under no circumstances will Viable Computing be liable in any way for
any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors
or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred
as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise
transmitted via CFD Review.
Each user, by using CFD Review, may be exposed to Content that is offensive,
indecent or objectionable. Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks
associated with the use of any Content, including any reliance on the
accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
6. Licensing and other terms applying to content posted on CFD Review
Use, reproduction, modification, and other intellectual property rights to
data stored on CFD Review will be subject to licensing arrangements that
may be approved by Viable Computing as applicable to such Content.
With respect to text or data entered into and stored by publicly-accessible
site features such as forums and comments ("CFD Review Public Content"),
the submitting user retains ownership of such CFD Review Public Content;
with respect to publicly-available statistical content which is generated by
the site to monitor and display content activity, such content is owned
by Viable Computing. In each such case, the submitting user grants Viable
Computing the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,
create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such
Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other
works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed,
all subject to the terms of any applicable license.
7. No resale of service
You agree not to sell, resell, or offer for any commercial purposes, any
portion of CFD Review, use of CFD Review, or access to CFD Review.
8. General practices regarding use and storage
Viable Computing may establish general practices and limits concerning use
of CFD Review. While Viable Computing will use reasonable efforts to back
up site data and make such data available in the event of loss or deletion,
Viable Computing has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or
failure to store any messages and other communications or other Content
maintained or transmitted by CFD Review. Viable Computing reserves the right
to mark as "inactive" and archive accounts and/or Content that are inactive
for an extended period of time. Viable Computing reserves the right to
change these general practices at any time, in its sole discretion,
with notice to users and the public as described in Section 1 above.
9. Termination
Viable Computing may terminate a user's account in Viable Computing's absolute
discretion and for any reason. Viable Computing is especially likely to
terminate for reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) violation of these Terms; (2) abuse of site resources or attempt to
gain unauthorized entry to the site or site resources; (3) use of
CFD Review in a manner inconsistent with the Purpose; (4) a user's request
for such termination; or (4) as required by law, regulation, court or
governing agency order.
Viable Computing's termination of any user's access to CFD Review may be
effected without notice and, on such termination, Viable Computing may
immediately deactivate or delete user's account and/or bar any further
access to such files. Viable Computing shall not be liable to any user
or other third party for any termination of that user's access or account
hereunder. In addition, a user's request for termination will result in
deactivation but not necessarily deletion of the account. Viable
Computing reserves the right to delete, or not delete, a user's account
at Viable Computing's sole discretion, as well as to delete, or not delete,
content at Viable Computing's sole discretion.
10. Links
Viable Computing, CFD Review or a third party may provide links to
other websites. Viable Computing exercises no control whatsoever over such
other websites and web-based resources and is not responsible or liable
for the availability thereof or the Content, advertising, products or
other materials thereon. Viable Computing shall not be responsible or
liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss incurred or suffered
by any user in connection therewith. Your access and use of linked websites,
including information, material, products and services therein, is solely
at your own risk.

affiliates and their respective officers, employees
and agents, and each of Viable Computing's website partners, from any and
all claims, demands, damages, costs, and liabilities including reasonable
attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of that
user's acts or omissions, including claims arising out of that user's
use of CFD Review; his or her submission, posting or transmission of
Content or his or her violation of the Terms.

EXCLUDING ONLY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF VIABLE COMPUTINGS'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, VIABLE COMPUTING SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE,

OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY USER'S USE OR
INABILITY TO USE CFD REVIEW OR SERVICES THEREON; THE COST OF PROCUREMENT
OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR
TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON CFD REVIEW;
OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO CFD REVIEW. IN NO EVENT SHALL VIABLE
COMPUTING'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO ANY USER OR OTHER PARTY UNDER
THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR OTHERWISE EXCEED $1,000.00. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR

DEEMED TO CREATE AN AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP, JOINT VENTURE, EMPLOYEE-EMPLOYER
OR FRANCHISOR-FRANCHISEE RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND BETWEEN VIABLE COMPUTING

13. Copyrights
Viable Computing respects the intellectual property rights of others, and
requires that the people who use CFD Review do the same. It is our policy

If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on this
site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify us
by providing our copyright agent with the following information in writing:
(1) the electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright
or the person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;
(2) identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
(3) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and
information reasonably sufficient to permit Viable Computing to locate
the material, including the full URL.
(4) your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
(5) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed
use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
(6) a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information
in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are
authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
If Viable Computing receives such a claim, Viable Computing reserves the
right to refuse or delete Content as described under Section 5 hereto, or
to terminate a user's account in accordance with Section 9.
Our designated agent to receive notification of claimed infringement under
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act OF 1998 ("DMCA") is:
After receiving a claim of infringement, Viable Computing will process and
investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate
actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property laws.
Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying with the
DMCA, Viable Computing will act expeditiously to remove or disable access
to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of
infringing activity, and will act expeditiously to remove or disable access
to any reference or link to material or activity that is claimed to be
infringing. Viable Computing will take reasonable steps to expeditiously
notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to such material.
Upon receipt of a proper counter notification under the DMCA, Viable
Computing will promptly provide the person who provided the initial
notification of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification
and inform that person that it will replace the removed material or
cease disabling access to it in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days.
Additionally, Viable Computing will replace the removed material and
cease disabling access to it ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days
following receipt of the counter notice, unless Viable Computing's designated
agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the initial
notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order
to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating
to the material on the Viable Computing system or network.
You may provide us with a counter notification by providing our copyright
agent the following information in writing:
(1) your physical or electronic signature;
(2) identification of the material that has been removed or to which access
has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before
it was removed or access to it was disabled, including the full URL;
(3) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief
that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
(4) your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you
consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside
of the United States, for any judicial district in which Viable Computing
may be found and that you will accept service of process from the person
who provided the initial notification of infringement.
14. General information
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and Viable
Computing and govern each user's use of CFD Review, superseding any prior
agreements. Each user may be subject to additional terms and conditions
that may apply when that user uses affiliate services, third party content
or third party software. The Terms and the relationship between each user
and Viable Computing shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas
without regard to its conflict of law provisions and each party shall
submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located
within the county of Harrison, Texas. If any provision of the Terms is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
15. Violations

intellectual property infringement) to Viable Computing at
