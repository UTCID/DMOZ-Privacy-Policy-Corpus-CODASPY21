Links to Third Party Sites
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.
Cookies
‘Cookies’ are small files sent from a web server to your computer through your browser program. There are two types of cookies: non-persistent and persistent cookies.
A non-persistent cookie enables a website to temporarily keep information on your computer as you travel from one page to another on our site. This cookie is automatically deleted from your machine when you close your browser.  Because these cookies are necessary to provide some functions, failure to allow such cookies will make our website unavailable to you.
A persistent cookie is kept even when you close your browser. You can manually delete these cookies using commands specific to your browser and computer system. These cookies store information that would generally not change from session to session.  They also contain information that would need to be reentered by you each time you visit the website. For example, a common use of persistent cookies is to allow a registered site visitor to enter the site without having to specify their user-id and password.
Use of Cookies
We use cookies for various reasons. We only read cookies written by our site. We do not use cookies to obtain information on other websites that you may visit. We may use cookies to store some history about the parts of our site that you have visited to help you navigate our site more easily.

The Conservancy complies fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).
