Simple P3P-Enabled Web Site ExampleMany sites, including personal home pages and sites
designed primarily to provide information (as opposed to those
designed to sell things or provide interactive services), have very
simple privacy policies. They tend to collect minimal amounts of data,
and generally will either commit to using that data in very limited
ways, or make no commitment that might limit future use of that data.
Furthermore, for these simple sites one P3P policy is probably
sufficient for the entire site.Example C-1 is a
policy reference file for a simple site named Example.Com that has one
policy for the entire site. This policy reference file is placed at
the well-known location (/w3c/p3p.xml). This file
also includes the site’s P3P policy. The policy reference file and
policy expiry are set to 10 days. The policy for this site also
applies to all the cookies set by this site. Example.com keeps typical
web logs. These logs are kept indefinitely and are used to diagnose
problems with the web site. They are not shared with other companies;
however, they are sometimes analyzed in order to gain insights into
how people are using the web site.Example C-1. A policy reference file for a simple site that includes an
