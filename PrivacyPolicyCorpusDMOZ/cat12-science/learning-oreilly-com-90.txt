Working Cryptographic Systems and ProtocolsA cryptographic system is a
collection of software and hardware that can encrypt or decrypt
information. A typical cryptographic system is the combination of a
desktop computer, a web browser, a remote web server, and the computer
on which the web server is running. A cryptographic protocol, by
contrast, describes how information moves throughout the cryptographic
system. In our examples, the web browser and the remote web server
communicate using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic
protocol.More than a dozen cryptographic protocols have been developed
for Internet security and commerce. These systems fall into two
categories. The first category of cryptographic programs and protocols
is used for encryption of offline messages—mostly email. The second
category of cryptographic protocols is used for confidentiality,
authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation for online
communications.Offline Encryption SystemsOffline
encryption systems are designed to take a message, encrypt it,
and either store the ciphertext or transmit it to another user on
the Internet. Some popular programs that are used for email
encryption are shown in Table
4-1 and described in the sections that follow.Table 4-1. Cryptographic protocols for offline communicationsProtocolWhat does it do?Widely deployed?Programs and systemsURLPGP/OpenPGPEncryption and digital signatures for email and

PGP/OpenPGPPGP (Pretty Good Privacy)[51] is a complete working system for the cryptographic
protection of electronic mail and files. OpenPGP is a set of standards (RFC 2440) that
describe the formats for encrypted messages, keys, and digital
signatures. PGP offers confidentiality, integrity, and
nonrepudiation.PGP was the first widespread public key encryption program.
The original version was written between 1990 and 1992 by Phil
Zimmermann and released on the Internet in June 1991. Later
versions were the result of efforts by Zimmermann and programmers
around the world.PGP is available in two ways: as a command-line program,
which can be run on many different operating systems, and as an
integrated application, which is limited to running on the Windows
and Macintosh platforms. The integrated application comes with
plug-in modules that allow it to integrate with popular email
packages such as Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, and
Netscape Communicator. With these plug-ins, the standard email
packages can automatically send and receive PGP-encrypted
messages.Current versions of PGP allow users to create two kinds of
private keys: encryption keys, which are
used for actually encrypting email messages, and
signing keys, which are used for digitally
signing messages. Older versions of PGP supported only a single
key that was used for both encryption and signing.Each PGP key consists of two parts: a person’s name and the
actual mathematical key that is used to perform cryptographic
operations, as shown in Figure
4-1.Figure 4-1. PGP keys consist of the actual public key that is used to
encrypt or decrypt information, one or more email addresses, and
one or more digital signatures attached to each email
address.Because PGP keys have names, one logical question to ask is
this: how do you know that a given PGP key really belongs to the
person whose name is on that key? This can be a very difficult
question to answer.The simplest way to be sure of a key’s authenticity is to
get a copy of the key from its owner. Unlike other email
encryption systems, every PGP user can certify any key that he
wishes: if you have a key, it is up to you to decide if you
believe that the key actually belongs to the person who is named
on the key’s certificate. When you get a person’s key and add it
to your PGP key ring , you can tell your copy of PGP whether or not to
trust the key.In practice, it is not always possible to have face-to-face
meetings with people before you get their keys. As an alternative
to face-to-face meetings, PGP has a provision for key signing.
That is, one PGP key can be used to sign a second key.
Essentially, this means that the first person is using his key to
attest to the validity of the second person. I may not be able to
meet directly with Sam, but if I trust Deborah, and I get a copy
of Sam’s key with Deborah’s signature on the key attesting to the
fact that Sam’s key is valid, I may trust the key. This process is
called certification. Certification is
discussed in detail in Chapter
7. Chapter 6 contains
additional discussion of PGP and provides examples of its
use.PGP’s name-based system also assumes that everybody who
signed and who uses the key thinks that the name on the key refers
to the same person. This may be true for some names and email
addresses, but it is certainly not true for others. There might be
many John Smiths; several people might use the email address
president@company.com over the course of a
few years. On this issue, PGP is silent.S/MIME
When you send an email with an attachment over the
Internet, the attachment is encoded with a protocol called the
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions,[52] or MIME. The MIME standard codifies the technique by
which binary files, such as images or Microsoft Word documents,
can be encoded in a format that can be sent by email.Secure/MIME[53] (S/MIME) extends the MIME standard to allow for
encrypted email. On the surface, S/MIME offers similar
functionality to PGP; both allow email messages to be encrypted
and digitally signed. But S/MIME is different from PGP in an
important way: to send somebody a message that is encrypted with
PGP you need a copy of that person’s key. With S/MIME, on the
other hand, to send somebody an encrypted message you need a copy
of that person’s S/MIME certificate. In general, people cannot create their
own S/MIME certificates. Instead, these certificates are issued by
third parties called
certification authorities.
This extra layer of complexity has somewhat limited the widespread
adoption of S/MIME as a system for encrypted email.
Online Cryptographic Protocols and Systems
Online cryptographic protocols generally require
real-time interplay between a client and a server to work properly.
The most popular online protocol is SSL, which is used to protect
information as it is sent between a web browser and a web server.
Some popular systems that fall into this category are summarized in
Table 4-2 and described
in the following sections.Table 4-2. Cryptographic protocols for online communicationsProtocolWhat does it do?Widely deployed?Programs and systemsURLDNSSEC (Secure DNS)Provides secure hostname to IP address

[a] The Microsoft version of Kerberos contains
proprietary extensions not compatible with open
standards.SSLThe Secure Sockets Layer[54] (SSL) is a general-purpose web cryptographic
protocol for securing bidirectional communication channels. SSL is
commonly used with TCP/IP. SSL is the encryption system that is
used by web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft’s
Internet Explorer, but it can be used with any TCP/IP
service.SSL connections are usually initiated with a web browser
using a special URL prefix. For example, the prefix https:
is used to indicate an SSL-encrypted HTTP connection,
whereas snews: is used to
indicate an SSL-encrypted NNTP connection.SSL offers confidentiality through the use of:User-specified encryption algorithmsIntegrity, through the use of user-specified
cryptographic hash functionsAuthentication, through the use of X.509 v3 public key
certificatesNonrepudiation, through the use of cryptographically
signed messagesSSL is in the process of being replaced by the IETF
Transport Layer Security[55] (TLS) protocol. The two protocols are described in
depth in Chapter 5 and in
Appendix B.PCTThe
Private Communications Technology (PCT) is a
transport layer security protocol similar to SSL that was
developed by Microsoft because of shortcomings in SSL 2.0. The SSL
2.0 problems were also addressed in SSL 3.0 and, as a result, use
of PCT is decreasing. Nevertheless, Microsoft intends to continue
supporting PCT because it is being used by several large Microsoft
customers on their corporate intranets.SETThe
Secure Electronic Transaction[56] (SET) protocol is an online payment protocol
designed to facilitate the use of credit cards on the
Internet.The fundamental motivation behind SET is to speed
transactions while reducing fraud. To speed transactions, the
protocol automates the “buy” process by having the consumer’s
computer automatically provide the consumer’s credit card number
and other payment information, rather than forcing the consumer to
type this information into a form in a web browser. To reduce
fraud, SET was designed so that the merchant would never have
access to the consumer’s actual credit card number. Instead, the
merchant would receive an encrypted credit card number that could
only be decrypted by the merchant’s bank.There are three parts to the SET system: an “electronic
wallet” that resides on the user’s computer; a server that runs at
the merchant’s web site; and the SET Payment Server that runs at
the merchant’s bank. All of these parts need to be operational
before any transactions can be processed. Largely because of this
complexity, SET has not been successful in the marketplace to
date.A more detailed explanation of SET appears in Chapter 25.DNSSECThe
Domain Name Service Security (DNSSEC)
standard[57] is a system designed to bring security to the
Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS). DNSSEC creates a parallel
public key infrastructure built upon the DNS system. Each DNS
domain is assigned a public key. A domain’s public key can be
obtained in a trusted manner from the parent domain or it can be
preloaded into a DNS server using the server’s “boot” file.DNSSEC allows for secure updating of information stored in
DNS servers, making it ideal for remote administration. The DNSSEC
standard is built into the current version of
bind , the DNS server that is distributed by the Internet
Software Consortium.IPsec and IPv6IPsec[58] is a cryptographic protocol designed by the Internet
Engineering Task Force to provide end-to-end confidentiality for
packets traveling over the Internet. IPsec works with IPv4, the
standard version of IP used on today’s Internet. IPv6, the “next generation” IP, includes
IPsec.IPsec does not provide for integrity, authentication, or
nonrepudiation, but leaves these features to other protocols.
Currently, the main use of IPsec seems to be as a multivendor
protocol for creating
virtual private networks (VPNs) over the Internet.
But IPsec has the capacity to provide authentication, integrity,
and optionally, data confidentiality for all communication that
takes place over the Internet, provided that vendors widely
implement the protocol and that governments allow its use.KerberosKerberos[59] is a network security system developed at MIT and
used throughout the United States. Unlike the other systems
mentioned in this chapter, Kerberos does not use public key
technology.[60] Instead, Kerberos is based on symmetric ciphers and
secrets that are shared between the Kerberos server and each
individual user. Each user has his own password, and the Kerberos
server uses this password to encrypt messages sent to that user so
that they cannot be read by anyone else.Support for Kerberos must be added to each program that is
to be protected. Currently, “Kerberized” versions of Telnet, FTP,
POP, SSH, and Sun RPC are in general use. Several systems that use
Kerberos to provide authentication and confidentiality for HTTP
have been developed but not widely deployed.Kerberos is a difficult system to configure and administer.
To operate a Kerberos system, each site must have a Kerberos
server that is physically secure. The Kerberos server maintains a
copy of every user’s password. In the event that the Kerberos
server is compromised, every user’s password must be
changed.Despite the fact that Microsoft built support for Kerberos
into its Windows 2000 operating system, to date Kerberos has not
been widely deployed beyond a few academic environments. That
Microsoft built proprietary, non-standard extensions into their
version of Kerberos has probably worked against its
interoperability and more general adoption.SSHThe
Secure Shell (SSH)[61] provides for cryptographically protected virtual
terminal (telnet) and file transfer
(rcp) operations. Originally developed as
free software for Unix, a wide variety of both commercial and
noncommercial programs that implement the SSH protocol are now
available for Unix, Windows, Mac OS, and other platforms. These
implementations also allow for the creation of cryptographically
secured "tunnels” for other protocols.

reasons. The first was that when Kerberos was developed in
1985, computers were much slower. The developers thought that
public key encryptions and decryptions would be too slow to
use Kerberos to authenticate logins and requests for email.
The second reason was because of the Stanford and MIT patents.
Kerberos’ developers wanted to be able to distribute the code
freely over the Internet. They were worried that they would
have trouble if the system required the licensing of patents.
(Phil Zimmermann struggled with this same issue six years
later when he wrote PGP, but he resolved it
differently.)[61] http://www.ssh.com and
