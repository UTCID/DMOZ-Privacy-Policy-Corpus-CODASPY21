What Our Clients Say…
Sanya Mathura“Mark, It was an absolute pleasure to see you deliver the BFA course yesterday.The manner in which you made the topics come to life with your experiences and knowledge was great to behold. You continuously connected with the audience and had them engaged for the entire day! (Which is a bit tough to do especially after lunch). Your wealth of experience and knowledge throughout the day really helped in bringing the participants to the understanding of the PROACT methodology and the concepts that were covered in the BFA. “Sanya Mathura, Managing Director & Senior ConsultantStrategic Reliability Solutions LtdVernon KingsburyFrom the results that it [Reliability Center’s Basic Failure Analysis (BFA) process] can achieve, I have a difficult time understanding why every company in the U.S. does not make use of BFA as a regular part of the way they conduct business.Vernon Kingsbury - Maintenance AnalystLafarge Corporation (U.S. Region)
