Why Microbiology Matters
Why Microbiology Matters
The Microbiology Society is a membership charity for scientists interested in microbes, their effects and their practical uses.
What is microbiology?
Microbiology is the study of all living organisms that are too small to be visible with the naked eye. This includes bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, prions, protozoa and algae, collectively known as 'microbes'.
Aims & Objectives
The Microbiology Society has a vision and mission around which we base our strategy. Our members have a unique depth and breadth of knowledge about the discipline. The Society’s role is to help unlock and harness the potential of that knowledge.
