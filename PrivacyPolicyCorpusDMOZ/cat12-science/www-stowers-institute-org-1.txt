Privacy Policy
The Stowers Institute for Medical Research values its donors, job applicants, volunteers and all online visitors (collectively, "Visitors") and is committed to respecting and protecting their privacy. It does not sell, trade or rent information it collects from them with other organizations or use that information to make mailings on behalf of other organizations. Within the Stowers Institute, we limit access to this information to circumstances that require such access.
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
Information the Stowers Institute collects includes personal information that is voluntarily provided by Visitors, including electronically, and information that is publicly available. The types of personally identifiable information collected may include a Visitor's name, home, work and email address, telephone and fax number, credit card information, date of birth, gender, qualifications, educational and work history and expertise.
The Stowers Institute uses that information to accept donations and applications for employment; to inform our donors and friends about news from the Stowers Institute, upcoming events, and our fundraising needs; to thank donors; and to distribute receipts.
The Stowers Institute provides the opportunity to those donors who do not wish to be publicly acknowledged to be recognized anonymously.

The Stowers Institute also collects certain traffic data information such as an online Visitor's IP address, domain server, type of computer and type of web browser. This is anonymous information that does not personally identify the Visitor but is helpful for purposes of improving the experience on our website.
