This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how TechTarget, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “TechTarget,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) use cookies and similar technologies to recognize individuals who access our websites and sub-domains (“users” or “you”) when they visit our website and interact with the content and ads that are posted on these websites. This Policy outlines the types of cookies and other similar technologies used on our websites, why we use them, and what your rights are to control the use of them. For a comprehensive understanding of the types of information that we collect, how we use the information that we collect, and why we collect certain types of information, please read our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized terms not defined in this Policy have the meanings set forth in our Privacy Policy.
By continuing to visit our websites or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and other similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this Policy.
I. What are Cookies?
Cookies are small data files which are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. For example, cookies enable us to identify you andremember your preferences so we can enhance your experience on our websites. They also help us serve you ads relevant to your professional interests.
II. Why Do We Use Cookies?
We use cookies for a variety of reasons. These cookies may be first party cookies (meaning that they are supported by TechTarget) or third party cookies (meaning that they are hosted by a party other than TechTarget, such as TechTarget service providers and Partners). Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit our websites or use our services and they allow us to bring you relevant advertising both on and off our websites,
We use several different types of cookies on our websites, including the following.
Essential Cookies: Essential cookies facilitate the operation of our websites. Without the use of these cookies, portions of our websites would not function properly. For example, we use essential cookies to help us identify which of our visitors have previously registered in order to access our premium content.
Analytical Performance Cookies: Analytical performance cookies help us monitor the performance of our websites and how users interact with it. These cookies provide us with information that allows us to improve our websites and services.
Functional Cookies:Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites and to authenticate your identity. For example, we use functional cookies to recognize and save your name and password on our websites.
Flash Cookies: When you use one of our websites that employs Macromedia Flash Player, a small Flash Cookie may be used. The purpose of using these cookies is to store your flash player preferences and enhance your browsing experience.
Behavioral Advertising Cookies:TechTarget and its Partners use behavioral advertising cookies in order to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests when you visit websites on and off our network. Behavioral advertising cookies analyze information about your interests and your browsing history, and provide you with advertisements on and off our network which matches these interests. Behavioral advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time – so it’s different than advertising you may see when you’re looking for something online using a search engine (e.g., Google, Yahoo, or Bing) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time. As an example, you may be doing research on products and services related to data center virtualization. If a data center virtualization provider is conducting an advertising campaign on our network, as you browse the relevant portions of our sites, we may serve you with one of the advertisements of one of their solutions.
III. What is Do Not Track (“DNT”)
DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for the internet industry to enable internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. To date, no standard has been adopted. As such, TechTarget does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.
IV. How are Cookies used for Advertising Purposes?
Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us to serve you ads relevant to your professional interests. They also help us to provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by TechTarget may also set third party cookies.
If you are logged in to our services and one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage (such as your browsing behavior) and log data (such as your IP address), will be associated by us with your Membership Information as discussed in Section V of our Privacy Policy. We also use aggregate data from third parties and data from your activity on our websites. Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:
provide you with services, publications, and information that may be of interest to you;
deliver or display content or interest-based advertising that matches your professional interests and responsibilities;
offer you opportunities to connect directly with your peers and with providers of technologies, goods, and services that may be of interest to you; or
detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect our members and partners.
For further information regarding our use of cookies and other similar technologies for advertising purposes, and the controls available, please see Section XII of our Privacy Policy.
V. How Can You Control the Use of Cookies?
You have the power to control the use of cookies on your devices. You may modify your browser settings to accept or reject all cookies, or to prevent it from accepting certain cookies or certain types of cookies.  It may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device. If you modify your browser settings to prevent it from accepting all cookies, please be aware that the functionality of many of our websites will be impaired.
Please note that, although Flash cookies are stored on your devices in a similar fashion to standard cookies, they are stored in a different location. As such, you cannot manage these cookies directly from your browser. For information about how you can manage Flash cookies, please visit Adobe’s website.

VI. How Can I Prevent Cookies or Other Tracking Technologies and Uses of My Information?
You can view and manage the cookies we set on this website via our consent manager here. You will continue to be served with advertisements; however, they will not be tailored to your web preferences, usage patterns and professional interests. If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other device. If you use our websites and services without changing your browser settings, then we will assume that you have agreed to receive all cookies on our websites.
Online Behavioral Advertising: You can prevent online behavioral advertising by modifying your browser settings. The “Your Online Choices” page provided by the Internet Advertising Bureau(IAB), provides an easy way to opt out of behavioral advertising from each (or all) of the networks represented by the IAB.
