Obtaining a Software Publishing Certificate
Although Microsoft’s Authenticode technology should work
with software publishing digital certificates from any recognized
certification authority, when this book went to press the only CA
issuing these certificates was VeriSign.As of July 2001, VeriSign issues two kinds of software
publisher’s certificates, which the company now calls Code Signing
Digital IDs. The CodeSigner Standard ID costs $400 and comes with
$50,000 of “NetSure Protection,” promises a “Keynote Performance
Audit” from 10 cities, and promises 2-day express delivery. For
practical purposes, the real difference is that if you pay more money,
you can get faster turnaround.Previously, VeriSign had offered “Personal” certificates for use
with Authenticode. These certificates were handy because they cost
roughly half as much as the commercial certificates and they were
available to individuals, rather than corporations, yet they were as
powerful as commercial certificates. Perhaps that is the reason that
the personal certificates were discontinued.
