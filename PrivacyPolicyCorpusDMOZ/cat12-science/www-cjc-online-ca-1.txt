You understand that the Canadian Journal of Communication is a delayed open access journal and your article, once published, will be available by subscription for one year. After a year, the article will be open access. This means that you are willing to grant CJC exclusive rights to the distribution of your article for the period beginning with the acceptance of your article and ending 12 months after its publication date.
The submission file is in DOC or DOCX format (i.e., filename ends with .doc or .docx)

This information may be submitted in a supplementary file called “All authors and affiliations” or in the submissions text box following the submitting author’s identity.”
The submission file does not include any spaces in the file name (i.e., My_Article_Name.doc instead of My Article Name.doc).
All identifying author information has been removed from the main article submission file as per the provided instructions. Please note that this is not required for book reviews.
The text is double-spaced; uses a 12-point font; employs italics, rather than underlining (except with URL addresses).
All URL addresses in the text (e.g., CJC Online) are activated and ready to click.
The text meets this journal's formatting requirements as outlined in the Author Guidelines.
All images, figures, and tables are not included in the submission file. Instead, all images, figures, and tables have been saved as separate files using file formats outlined in the Author Guidelines and will be submitted in Step 4 of the online submission as supplementary files.
All audio and/or video files have been saved as separate files using file formats outlined in the Author Guidelines and will be submitted in Step 4 of the online submission as supplementary files.

Reviews
Interested in doing a book or media review? Check CJC's "Announcement" page to see currently  available titles. The  CJC is interested in commissioning reviews from a wide variety of scholars and students.Book-Review GuidelinesThe book's contents should be concisely stated. Most of the review should be dedicated to the assessment of the book's strengths and weaknesses. Rather than listing in detail what is found in each of the book's chapters, the reviewer should emphasize what is most significant in the volume, the adequacy of the methods deployed, and the overall worth of the text. The issues addressed in the review could include some of the following:
What are the origins of the text? How did it come to be produced?
What is the book generally about? What is the intent of the author in writing the book (e.g., scholarship, entertainment, political partisanship, etc.)?
What standpoint is taken (e.g., detached scholar, autobiographical, advocacy, etc.)?
What is the line of argument, if any?
What sort of evidence is used?
How is the material organized and structured?
To what extent does the author achieve his/her goals?
Is the standpoint appropriate to the intentions and the subject matter?
Do the steps in the argument follow logically?
Are there hidden assumptions?
Are the claims following from the argument well supported by evidence?
Is the work generally persuasive? Why or why not?
Is the work generally consistent (i.e., are there contradictions)?
Is the work generally coherent (i.e., do the various parts complement one another and go together well)?
Is the book well written?
To what extent does the book make a contribution to our understanding of the particular area of communication in question?
The length of the review should be around 1000 words and we would like to have it by three months from the current date.
Abstracts
For each article (but not the commentaries or the research in brief, although if supplied we will publish), the author must provide a 100-125 word abstract in English and French. These summaries should be placed immediately below the article title, author and institutional affiliation. Each summary should be indented 2.5 cm (1/2") and double spaced. For those who require the service, translations of abstracts and keywords can be undertaken by the Journal at a cost of 25 cents per word. The format of the abstract is as follows:
ABSTRACT
Background
Analysis
Conclusions and implications
Keywords
RÉSUMÉ
Contexte
Analyse
Conclusions et implications
Mots clés
Author Bio
The author(s) must supply a brief (25 word) bio giving name, rank, institution, and email address. Author information and bio should be entered in Step 2 of the online submission process, and not as part of the submission file itself. For example, Rowland Lorimer is Director of the Master of Publishing Program and Professor of Communication at Simon Fraser University. Email: lorimer@sfu.ca
General Formatting
Authors are advised to follow as closely as possible the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA Manual), with necessary variations to suit the field of Communication and Canadian spelling practices. Please see recent CJC volumes for current style and formats being followed.
Layout
The text should be double-spaced.
Start each paragraph at the margin (no tabs to indent first line). Place an extra blank line between paragraphs to separate.
Dashes should be keyed in as double-hyphens with no space at either end. For example: word--word or use an open em-dash as per CJC style.
Heading Styles
First level headings: (Boldface, first word capitalized, justified at left margin, on a separate line)
Second level headings: (Plain type, first word capitalized, justified at left margin, on a separate line)
Third level headings: (Italic type, first word capitalized, justified at left margin, on a separate line)
Citations in the Text
If the work has more than one author, give all the names the first time the work is referred to, then et al. thereafter.
When titles of journals or books are mentioned, they should be italicized, not underlined.
If the citation follows a quotation, place the parentheses after the quotation marks but before the end punctuation. For example: ''for the future of telecommunications'' (Smith, 1987, p. 42).
References
Following the Notes, list only those works actually cited in the text.
The heading for the references should be bold and left-justified, as References.
Double space all entries.
Begin each entry at the margin and indent the subsequent lines by 1/2 inch; i.e., hanging indent.
Separate the main items in each entry by periods (i.e., name of author, title of book, etc.) Leave one space between a period and next part of the entry.
Publication date should be in parentheses following author name. Title of book should be in italics and only the first word and first word after a colon should be capitalized (see examples above).
For articles, the title should be in plain text, with only the first word capitalized; the title of the periodical or edited book should be in italics.
For journals the volume number of the periodical volume is in italics, with the issue number in plain text and parentheses. Page numbers are given at the end of the reference but without the requirement for 'page'' or 'p.' See examples below.
The formats must be strictly adhered to in terms of punctuation and order of the items within each entry:
Book: Klein, Naomi. (2000). No logo: Taking aim at the brand bullies. New York, NY: Picador.Article in a book: Garnham, Nicholas. (2004). The information society theory as ideology.  In F. Webster (Ed.), The Information Society Reader (pp. 165-183). London, UK: Routledge.Article in a journal: Aronczyk, Melissa. (2009). How to do things with brands: Uses of national identity.

Use of Notes
Footnotes are not used in this format; only endnotes are used.
Do not use automatically formatted endnotes. Notes should appear at the end of the text and before the references (typed in a regular text). Endnote numbers in the text should be regular text formatted as eight-point superscript.
Use of notes should be very sparing. They should be used only where additional explanations are absolutely necessary and cannot be incorporated in the text. Maximum: 10.
Notes should be listed after the text and before the list of biographical references.
The heading for the notes should be bold and left-justified, as Notes.
Keyword index
The CJC requests that potential authors assign keywords from the following list to their article. Authors should confine their selection to five keywords or less, some of which may be their own.A.
