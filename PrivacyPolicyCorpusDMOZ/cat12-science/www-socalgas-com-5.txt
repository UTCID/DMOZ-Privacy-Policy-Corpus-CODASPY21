Applications for energy efficiency program participation, rebates, and incentives; and
Requesting to be included on mailing, email, texting, landline telephone, or cellular telephone lists of SoCalGas, as may be described in more detail on this web site from time to time.

Examples of Personal Information you may submit include your name or, when combined with your name or other information which could reasonably be used to identify you, your mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information.

SoCalGas uses this Personal Information to provide services, conduct its business, and improve our visitors’ experience on our web site.

SoCalGas may collect Non Personal Information by using cookies, agents, or through the collection of traffic data and location information.

Additionally, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our services and to help us understand the use of our web site. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, even if you have enabled your browser’s DNT functionality.
