Staff Handbook
The Staff Handbook applies only to staff employees whose working conditions are protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. This general “umbrella” act established minimum wages, overtime pay, and equal pay requirements. All staff employees are “non-exempt”: that is, they are protected by these requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Faculty, administrative and professional employees are “exempt”; that is, they are not covered by some parts of the Act. For example, “exempt” employees may have to work long and irregular hours but are not eligible for overtime pay or compensatory time off.
Full-time staff employees work at least 35 hours per week for at least 39 weeks or the equivalent thereof (a total of at least 1,365 hours annually). Regular work weeks may be scheduled over 4, 5 or 6 days depending on the requirements of the job assignment.
Part-time staff employees perform a specific ongoing task and work at least 17 1/2 hours per week for 52 weeks or the equivalent thereof (a total of at least 910 hours annually).
Both full-time and part-time staff employees are eligible for benefits as discussed in the sections on Salary and Benefits.
Other employees are hired either for a specific assignment of limited duration or as a temporary replacement for an existing position, or they work less than 910 hours annually. Such employees are not entitled to fringe benefits other than Social Security.

Administrative/Professional Staff Handbook
The Administrative and Professional Handbook applies to administrative and professional employees, who, by the nature of their jobs, meet the general and technical exemption requirements established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The classification of positions as administrative or professional is identified in the letter of appointment. Employees in this category qualify as "exempt" from the overtime provisions of the FLSA, either because of the scope of their work assignments or because of particular professional requirements of the positions for which they were hired. Administrators and professionals are responsible for completing tasks that may require more than a standard 40 hour work week. Exempt personnel are not subject to time-clock hours, nor are they eligible for overtime pay or compensatory time off.
Exempt personnel may be full-time employees, part-time employees, grant-related employees, and others.
Full-time employees are hired for full-time responsibilities, as defined in the letter of appointment, for at least 39 weeks per year or at least 75% of full-time year round responsibilities.
Part-time employees are hired for between 50% and 75% of full-time year round responsibilities.
Full-time and part-time exempt employees are eligible for benefits as discussed in the section on Salary and Benefits.
Grant-related employees are hired by the College on the basis of a grant made by an outside agency for research or other special programs. These employees are eligible for benefits based on the provisions of the grant as discussed at the time of hiring.
Other employees are hired for positions with: a) predetermined termination dates for a period of one year or less, or b) a regular work period of less than 50% of full-time year round responsibilities. Employees in these positions are not entitled to benefits.

General Whistleblower / EthicsPoint Reporting Policy
Introduction
This Policy governs the reporting of allegations of unethical behavior, illegal activity, financial or other misconduct and the protection against retaliation afforded to those who make such reports.
In order to encourage the reporting of suspected unethical behavior, illegal activity, and financial or other misconduct, Haverford College will be providing members of the community the option of anonymous and confidential reporting to EthicsPoint.
Haverford employees and community members already have the option of reporting misconduct internally to the specific individuals identified in many other Haverford policies and procedures.  In addition to these reporting options, the College also offerS reporting through EthicsPoint, which can be done on an anonymous confidential basis, in order to further encourage the reporting of misconduct.
Reporting Using EthicsPoint
Examples of misconduct that Haverford employees and other members of the Haverford community can report to EthicsPoint include, but are not limited to:
Academic misconduct, including cheating / plagiarism, alcohol abuse, hazing, sexual harassment, and other safety issues.
Accounting and financial misconduct, including fraud, theft, embezzlement, waste or abuse of resources, submission of false and fraudulent documents, bribes or kickbacks, and falsification of contracts, reports or records. (Accounting and financial misconduct may also be reported internally as described below in Section 3 on Reporting/Investigation of Alleged Financial Misconduct.)
Human resources misconduct, including conflicts of interest, discrimination or harassment, benefits abuses, offensive communication, threats, and unsafe working conditions.
Information technology misconduct, including malicious or inappropriate use of technology, data privacy issues, misuse of resources, and software piracy.
Medical misconduct, including intrusion into protected health information, insurance issues, or research misconduct.
Research misconduct, including conflicts of interest, data privacy issues, safety issues, fraud, human or animal research, intellectual property issues, and scientific misconduct.
How to Report Using EthicsPoint
Reports of misconduct may be made to EthicsPoint by phone or online.  Phone reports should be made by calling: 855-811-6222.  Online reports may be made at EthicsPoint Online Reporting.  More information is available at EthicsPoint FAQs.
Anonymity and Confidentiality with EthicsPoint
While EthicsPoint offers fully anonymous and confidential reporting, individuals making reports to EthicsPoint must actively choose to remain anonymous by not providing identifying information.  Individuals making reports to EthicsPoint may also choose to identify themselves to EthicsPoint.
Upon receiving a report, EthicsPoint will send the report to the appropriate person within the College to handle it, based on the type of violation and location of the incident identified in that report.  While the College will endeavor to maintain appropriate confidentiality of reporting sources and work diligently to assure privacy regarding the matter or circumstance being reported, the College cannot and does not guarantee confidentiality for individuals who provide identifying information to EthicsPoint.
Reporting/Investigation of Alleged Financial Misconduct
In addition to reporting via EthicsPoint, reports of alleged financial misconduct such as fraud, waste, theft, or abuse of funds may be made by utilizing the below internal procedures.  These reporting procedures apply only to matters related to potential financial misconduct.  All other allegations or grievances regarding employment, harassment, criminal conduct, and other matters are handled through other policies and procedures already established at the College, including EthicsPoint as described above.
Who To Contact to Report Financial Misconduct
If you encounter or become aware of any suspected financial misconduct at the College, you are encouraged to report it.
If you are a student, your first report should be to the Dean of the College.  If your report is about the Dean of the College, or if you for some reason are unable to contact the Dean, you may provide a written report in a sealed envelope, addressed as follows:  Jonathan M. Gamse, Chair, Haverford Audit Committee, Office of the President, Haverford College, 370 Lancaster Avenue, Haverford, PA 19041.
If you are not a student, your first report should be to the Director of Human Resources.  If your report is about the Director of Human Resources, or if you for some reason are unable to contact the Director, you may provide a written report in a sealed envelope, addressed as follows:  Jonathan M. Gamse, Chair, Haverford Audit Committee, Office of the President, Haverford College, 370 Lancaster Avenue, Haverford, PA 19041.
If the initial reporting party is the Dean of the College or the Director of Human Resources, they must provide their report directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee.  This only applies to reports where the Dean of the College or the Director of Human Resources is the original source of the complaint, not where they are receiving information from others.
If for whatever reason the initial report comes to you about suspected financial misconduct, you should direct the reporting party to the Dean of the College or the Director of Human Resources, as appropriate and consistent with the procedures set forth here.
How to Make Contact to Report Financial Misconduct
You may contact the Dean of the College or the Director of Human Resources via letter, telephone, a personal visit during normal office hours, or electronic mail.  Current contact information for those individuals is available on the Haverford College website.  As of January, 2020, the contact information is:
If to the Dean of the College:

Confidentiality and Anonymity
The College will endeavor to maintain appropriate confidentiality of reporting sources—whether those sources report internally or through EthicsPoint.  However, for all reporting sources who choose to identify themselves, the College cannot and does not guarantee confidentiality.  Identification of the reporting source (also known as a “whistleblower”) to the appropriate persons is often necessary to enable the College or law enforcement officials to effectively investigate the report.  Moreover, sometimes such identification is required by law.  Finally, it is sometimes appropriate to identify the whistleblower so the accused individual can assess and respond to the report against them.
Whistleblower Protection / Non-Retaliation
No member of the Haverford College community may retaliate against a whistleblower, and no whistleblower may be disciplined for providing a report in good faith.  Prohibited retaliatory conduct includes, but is not limited to, threats or actions that adversely affect the terms or conditions of employment or enrollment, threats of physical harm, or threats of pecuniary harm.
Any whistleblower who feels threatened or feels that they have been retaliated against should provide a written complaint, explaining the circumstances, to the Director of Human Resources.  Threats of physical harm should also be reported promptly to the Executive Director of Bi-College Campus Safety.  If for some reason reporting to the Director of Safety and Security and/or the Director or Human Resources is not feasible or appropriate, the written complaint should be provided to the College’s Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance, , Treasurer.  All charges of retaliation will be investigated.
View additional information related to Employee Whistleblower Protection in connection with Federally funded grants and contracts.
False Reporting Prohibited
This Policy is intended to: (1) encourage legitimate reports of possible wrongdoing by responsible College community members; and (2) protect those who provide such reports from retaliation.  By contrast, any person who knowingly makes a false report will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include action by authorities both on and off-campus.
Investigation of Alleged Misconduct
If an investigation appears warranted based upon the information received from the reporting source, the College will thereafter conduct an investigation.  Neither the whistleblower nor the target of the complaint will conduct nor have any right to direct the investigation.
