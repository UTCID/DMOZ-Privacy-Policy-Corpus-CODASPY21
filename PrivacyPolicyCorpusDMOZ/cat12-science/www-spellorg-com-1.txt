This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
Identifiable Information'
(PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information
that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person,
or to
identify an
individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we
collect,
use, protect or otherwise
handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?
We do not collect personal information from visitors of our site.
When do we collect information?
We collect non-personal information from you when you visit our site. Like many other Web sites, spellorg.com

The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser,
Internet
Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and
number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and

COOKIES
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the browser of the
user. If the corresponding Internet page is retrieved, the browser of the user sends back the content of
the cookies and thus enables recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically deleted after
the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored for a predetermined time
or permanently in the user's browser and then delete themselves (so-called temporary or permanent
cookies)
What data is stored in the cookies?
In cookies, no personal data is stored, but only an online identifier.
How can you prevent the use of cookies or delete cookies?
You can deactivate the storage of cookies via your browser settings and delete already stored cookies at
any time in your browser (see the section "Technical notes"). Please note, however, that this online
offering without cookies may not work or may only work to a limited extent.
Please note, furthermore, that contradictions against the creation of user profiles partly work through
a so-called "opt-out cookie". If you delete all cookies, a contradiction may therefore no longer be
taken into account and must be collected again by you.
What cookies do we use?
Analysis cookies
We use analysis cookies in order to be able to record the usage behavior (eg clicked advertising
banners, visited sub-pages, made search queries) of our users and to evaluate them in statistical form.
Advertising cookies of third parties
We also allow other companies to collect our users' data through advertising cookies. This allows us and
third parties to provide users of our online service with interest-based advertising based on an
analysis of their usage behavior (eg, clicked banner ads, visited subpages, requested search queries),
and not limited to our online offerings.
Spellorg.com delivers advertising banners on behalf of its customers. All our banners use cookies. We
place these banners on third-party websites, such as a news page, with the help of third-party
providers.
Spellorg.com takes reasonable steps to protect any information we process from misuse, loss,
unauthorized access, modification or notification. We take physical, electronic and procedural security
measures to protect the data we process. By doing so, we restrict access to this information to
authorized employees.
For the cookies that our third-party advertisers place for advertising purposes, we refer to the
disclaimers that they have provided on the topic on their own websites. Note that we can only refer to
these disclaimers, as they change regularly and Spellcheck.net has no control over them.
