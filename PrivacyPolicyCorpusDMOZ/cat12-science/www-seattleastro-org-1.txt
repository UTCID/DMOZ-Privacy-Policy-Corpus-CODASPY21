The SAS will never give or sell private information to a third party. All private information supplied by SAS members is by default only visible to the SAS Board.
If a member permits, we will also share private information with officially appointed SAS volunteers. This option can be selected in member account settings.
If a member permits, we will send address and contact information to the
Astronomical League.
This option can be selected in
member account settings.
When a member permits sending of personal contact information to the Astronomical League, that person's SAS membership will include Astronomical League membership; subscription to the Astronomical League's quarterly publication, The Reflector; and eligibility to earn Astronomical League observing certificates.
We do not request or store any information other than what is shown in the membership application and associated
member account settings.
