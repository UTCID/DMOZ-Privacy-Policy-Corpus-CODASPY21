Terms of Service
Agreement. This agreement is between you and Economic Security Planning, Inc., with a principal place of business at 203 St. Botolph St. Apt. 3, Boston, MA 02115 (“ESP”). These Terms of Service and the ESP Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the “Terms”) shall govern your use of ESP’s SaaS offerings, including but not limited to all versions of MaxiFi Planner, MaxiFi Premium, MaxiFi Pro, Maximize My Social Security (for households and professionals), and Analyze My Divorce Settlement (for households and professionals) and any other services or web sites provided to you by ESP (collectively, the “Services”) and any professional services as specified in an applicable order form related to the Services (the “Professional Services”).
Acceptance. You accept the Terms by either (a) clicking to “agree” or to “accept” the Terms when logging onto your user account to access the Services or by (b) using the Services or receiving Professional Services. You may not use the Services or accept the Terms if (a) you are younger than 18 or you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with ESP or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under applicable laws or regulations. ESP reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time by posting the amended terms to its website or otherwise providing you notice of the amended Terms. Your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of such amended terms. If you do not agree with these Terms (as amended from time to time), your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Services.
Access and Use. Subject to and conditioned on your compliance with the Terms, including payment of all applicable fees, ESP hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services during the Term, solely for use by you in accordance with the terms and conditions herein. Such use is limited to your internal use and is subject to any additional restrictions set forth in the order form.
No Financial Advice. You hereby acknowledge and agree that ESP is not an investment, financial, broker or tax advisor, and that no oral or written information or advice provided by ESP, its officers, directors, employees, or agents, nor any information obtained through the Services, will or shall constitute investment, financial or tax advice. While the Services may provide significant assistance in helping you manage your finances, and regardless of how any information or material is described at the time it is provided to you, such information or material is provided to you solely as a convenience and for informational purposes. You agree to consult with competent and independent professional financial and tax advisors before making any investment decisions or deciding on significant changes to your financial strategy. You are solely and exclusively responsible for all financial decisions made by you or by any other third party on your behalf, whether made as a result of or while using the Services or otherwise. ESP shall not be responsible or held liable for any advice given or recommendations made by you or by any third party for any financial, taxation or other matter, or for the inaccuracy or lack of completeness of the data or information provided to you, regardless of whether you relied or not on such advice.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Social Security benefit estimates produced by the Services are solely estimates. Only the Social Security Administration can tell an individual precisely the benefits to which such individual will be eligible. The estimates provided by the Services may differ from the correct amounts due to mistakes in ESP’s computer code of which ESP is unaware, mistakes in ESP’s computer code of which ESP is aware, but which are in the process of fixing, or because of legislated changes in Social Security provisions of which ESP is unaware of or because of delays in ESP’s updates to the computer code for changes in Social Security provisions.
ESP and any third party providers shall not be considered an “expert” under the Securities Act of 1933.
The foregoing disclaimers shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Privacy. You agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, accessible at EconomicSecurityPlanning.com/privacy-policy, as may be amended from time to time, and you agree that any data that you provide will be used in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

We restrict access to personal information to ESP employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to provide the Services, the Professional Services or any support related thereto.

Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ESP, its officers and directors, its affiliates or subsidiaries, their sponsors, contractors, advertisers, vendors or their partners, and any of their successors or assigns, and any of their respective officers, directors, agents or employees (the “Released Parties”) from any loss, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, claims and proceedings arising out of or relating to: (a) your use of the Services; and (b) any alleged breach of the Terms by you.
Force Majeure. None of the parties shall be held responsible for any delay or failure to perform any part of this agreement to the extent that such delay or failure results from any cause beyond its control and without the fault or negligence of the party claiming excusable delay, such as acts of God, acts of war or terrorism, extraordinary acts of the United States of America or any state, territory or political subdivision thereof, fires, storms, floods, epidemics, riots, work stoppages, strikes (work stoppages and/or strikes of any of the parties to this agreement are specifically excluded from the language of this section), embargoes, computer viruses, unauthorized access, systems failure, failure or technical difficulties with software, hardware or other equipment, downtime for hardware and software maintenance, failure of communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems, unusual volumes of traffic, theft, government restrictions, exchange or market rulings, failure of utility services, adverse weather or events of nature.
General Legal Terms. The Terms, combined with your order form, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and ESP and govern your use of the Services, and completely replace any prior agreements between you and ESP in relation to the Services. If you have entered into an Enterprise Client Agreement or a Master Services Agreement with ESP, it is agreed that those terms may supersede these Terms of Service if they clearly state so.
You agree that if ESP does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which ESP has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of ESP’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to ESP. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.
The Terms, and your relationship with ESP under the Terms, will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any dispute regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the terms will be decided by confidential, final and binding arbitration conducted by a mutually agreed to arbitrator located within Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America. The filing fees and arbitrator's fees and costs in such arbitration will be borne by the non-prevailing party. The parties will be entitled to reasonable discovery of essential matters as determined by the arbitrator. In the arbitration, the parties will be entitled to all remedies that would have been available if the matter were litigated in a court of law. Notwithstanding this, you agree that ESP will still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
ESP may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to any party without your consent. You are not permitted to assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of ESP, and any such attempted assignment will be void and unenforceable.
