Terms and Conditions for Orders Placed with Cryoport as of October 28, 2020, and Thereafter, until Further Amended.
The customer (“Customer”) identified on the accompanying order hereby agrees that, (a) the following terms and conditions, coupled with (b) the terms and conditions of the Shipping Provider, identified in the order (the “Shipping Provider”), as set forth on the website for such Shipping Provider, shall apply to such order (together, the “Terms and Conditions”). In addition, Customer agrees that the Terms and Conditions shall apply to all future orders until such time as any Terms and Conditions are amended, in which case such amended Terms and Conditions shall apply to future orders, as applicable. Any order placed with Cryoport by the Customer shall be referred to herein as the “Order(s).” All terms used, but not identified herein, shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Orders.Controlling Document. The acceptance by Cryoport of any Order placed by Customer, either for (a) shipment by Customer of materials in any of Cryoport’s various sized shipping containers, as more specifically described at www.cryoport.com (each such container, some of which may be referred to as a “dewar” at said web site, together with all parts, components, instruments, and other items/accessories comprising or accompanying such containers, referred to below as a “Shipper Unit”), (b) any management by Cryoport of similar shipping containers owned by the Customer, as may be specified in the Orders, or (c) for any additional service as may be provided by Cryoport from time-to-time, as may be described or referenced in an Order and/or in a written document signed by Cryoport referencing these Terms and Conditions (all of the foregoing, the “Service”), is expressly conditioned on Customer's agreement to the Terms and Conditions. The term Service also includes Orders processed on the Cryoport portal, www.cryoportal.com. “All Shipper Units” refers to those shipping containers that may be used in the fulfillment of an Order, which may include either Shipper Units owned by Cryoport or shipping containers owned by the Customer, or both, as specified in an Order. Cryoport shall provide the Service pursuant to the Terms and Conditions. The Terms and Conditions, together with the Order, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior communications, representations, understandings, agreements and course of dealings; provided, however, that if Customer and Cryoport have a written contract that refers to these Terms and Conditions, then the Terms and Conditions together with the Order augment such written contract. Any Order (or other document or communication) that is in any way inconsistent with the Terms and Conditions shall not be binding on Cryoport unless expressly agreed to in writing by Cryoport.Payment Obligations. For each Service specified in the Order, Customer shall pay to Cryoport the applicable base fees set forth in the Order (the “Base Fees”), and any additional fees and expenses chargeable to Customer that may arise pertaining to, and subsequent to the placing of, the Order, such as, but not limited to, specialty courier charges (collectively, together with the Base Fees, the “Payment Obligations”). Should Customer submit a Purchase Order or similar other document, then Cryoport reserves its right to assess appropriate fees not referenced in any such document. Customer shall pay to Cryoport each Payment Obligation within fifteen (15) days after the date of the applicable invoice for such Payment Obligation, unless otherwise agreed upon in an Order or in a separate writing by Cryoport and Customer. If Customers are paying for an Order via Credit Card, then Payment Obligations are due to be paid immediately, and Customer’s initial authorization to pay for Service shall also apply and authorize payment for any subsequent Payment Obligations arising from fulfillment of an Order. For each Order, Customer shall be responsible, at Customer’s sole cost, for all fees and expenses (which shall be included in the Payment Obligations) of the delivery of All Shipper Units to and from such addresses that are set forth in the Order. CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY ABATEMENT, SET-OFF, DEFENSE OR COUNTER-CLAIM AND MAY NOT BE CANCELLED FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.Delivery and Acceptance. The Order shall specify for each Service, as applicable, the following: (a) the Cryoport facility or other address where All Shipper Units shall be picked-up by the Shipping Provider to begin the Service, (b) the name and shipping address to which All Shipper Units first shall be delivered, typically the Customer’s address, (c) the name and shipping address of the person or entity (each, a “Recipient”) to which All Shipper Units subsequently shall be delivered following their delivery to the address in “(b)” immediately above, (d) the address where All Shipper Units shall be delivered at the end of the Standard Cycle (as described below), (e) the number and type of All Shipper Units, (f) the Standard Cycle, (g) the Base Fees and any other Payment Obligations, and (h) the Shipping Provider. Customer shall have the right to cancel at no charge each Order prior to shipment by providing express written notification thereof to Cryoport not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Order’s scheduled commencement of Service. Should Customer notify Cryoport of a cancellation between twenty-four (24) and forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the scheduled commencement, then a seventy-five-dollar ($75) cancellation fee shall apply. However, a full charge shall apply upon twenty-four hours prior to the scheduled commencement of Service without Customer having provided any cancellation notification to Cryoport. Unless Customer designates a Shipping Provider and method of transportation in the Order acceptable to Cryoport, Cryoport shall designate the Shipping Provider and method of transportation. Cryoport shall make All Shipper Units that are the subject of the Order available for pick-up by the Shipping Provider as of the Order’s scheduled commencement of Service at the address indicated in the Order.Standard Cycle and Cycle Fee for Services Using Shipper Units. Unless otherwise agreed to in an Order or per a separate written agreement, the standard cycle for Service using a Shipper Unit is 15 days (“Standard Cycle”). Customer agrees to pay a lease rate fee for each such Standard Cycle (the “Cycle Fee”). The initial Cycle Fee is applicable starting the day the Shipper Unit is shipped from Cryoport’s facility. An additional Cycle Fee shall apply if the Shipper Unit is not returned within the Standard Cycle period to the Cryoport facility from where the Shipper Unit originally shipped. Customer bears the cost of all transportation freight to and from the originating Cryoport facility. Prior to Service commencing, Customers may elect to increase their Standard Cycle in 5-day increments (a “Revised Standard Cycle”), with the fee revised such that each additional 5 days will be billed an additional 33.33% (the “Revised Cycle Fee”). For any Shipper Unit that is not returned, upon the day after each Standard Cycle (or each Revised Standard Cycle if applicable) is completed, Customer shall be charged an additional Cycle Fee (or Revised Cycle Fee if applicable). Cryoport will charge Customer up to three such additional Cycle Fees (or Revised Cycle Fees if applicable) for Customer’s failure to return the Shipper Unit. If the Shipper Unit is still not returned by the end of the third such additional cycle, then Customer shall be charged the full replacement costs for the non-returned Shipper Unit, a “Lost Shipper Unit Fee.” If Customer later locates or finds the lost Shipper Unit, and on the condition both that Customer has paid all applicable Cycle Fees (including any applicable Revised Cycle Fees) and has paid the Lost Shipper Unit Fee within fifteen (15) days of receiving a bill for the lost item, then Customer shall be eligible to receive a credit for up to fifty percent (50%) of the Lost Shipper Unit Fee, subject to the Shipper Unit being returned to Cryoport, re-validated and tested, and placed back into service upon verification of no damages.Rights to Shipper Units; Inspection of All Shipper Units. Nothing contained in the Terms and Conditions may be construed as conveying to Customer any right, title or interest in or to the Shipper Units. Customer recognizes and acknowledges that Customer (or the Shipping Provider specified in the Order) has the right to maintain possession of the Shipper Units conditional upon Customer’s compliance with the Terms and Conditions. Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of Cryoport, assign or sublease any of the Shipper Units, or hypothecate, pledge or otherwise encumber or suffer a lien upon or against or otherwise convey any interest in any Shipper Units (or purport to do any of the foregoing). Customer shall indemnify Cryoport from any and all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from any such actual or purported assignment, sublease, hypothecation, pledge, encumbrance, lien or conveyance. Upon the request of Cryoport, Customer shall execute and deliver financing statements or similar documents, and take such other actions, to permit Cryoport to perfect a security interest in, or to evidence Cryoport’s ownership of, the Shipper Units. Cryoport hereby retains all right, title, and interest in and to any carbon dioxide emission or similar credits, offset rights, benefits and/or entitlements arising out of or related to the use of the Shipper Units. Customer shall provide Cryoport with waivers of interest or liens, from anyone claiming any interest in the Shipper Units. Cryoport may, at its sole discretion, open and inspect any of the All Shipper Units without notice.Maintenance and Use.

Further, if during a delivery, a Shipper Unit experiences a spill or other such contamination, Customer shall promptly provide written notice to Cryoport of the spill or contamination. Cryoport will then provide Customer with commercially reasonable instructions as to how to address the spill or other such contamination. Customer shall cooperate fully with Cryoport and any insurance companies producing insurance in accordance with the Terms and Conditions in the investigation and defense of any claims and suits arising from the use or operation of All Shipper Units.

What our clients are saying
“Cryoport does an amazing job of handling the shipping and logistics for transporting cryopreserved materials. We have switched to them for all of our exports.”
Bioengineering Core Employee – Cryoport Customer
“As a customer I'm very pleased with the service I received from Cryoport. Cryoport’s team always answered my questions, provided help in a professional manner and were extremely attentive.”
Cryoport Customer
“Had I known how great Cryoport’s dry vapor shipper and logistics system worked, we would have used Cryoport for all our previous shipments to the U.S. In the past we have used dry ice and several times we lost valuable cells because our shipments would sit in customs forever and the dry ice would evaporate. Cryoport eliminated that concern altogether. I will certainly be utilizing Cryoport’s services for future shipments.”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer
“By using Cryoport I experienced much less stress as my shipment went through customs!”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer
“I called Cryoport after hours for information about a shipment I needed to schedule and received absolutely outstanding customer service. Cryoport provided me with a lot of helpful information and great advice. It's rare and refreshing to receive such great service.”
Cryoport Customer
“Not only did my cells arrive safely, Cryoport’s service was professional and efficient. I highly recommend Cryoport.”
Hematologist – Cryoport Customer
“Working with Cryoport was a truly remarkable difference compared to my experience with other shippers. With the previous shipping company I was working with, it took almost three months to establish a ‘deep frozen account’ and required numerous hoop-jumping shenanigans only to ultimately be informed that the company could not arrange a shipment to or from Israel, which they were informed from the start was our desired shipping source.
Our sales rep at this organization was as dumbfounded by our experience as we were. To his credit, after his company declined our business, he suggested I contact Cryoport. I have written thanking him for his suggestion and to let his ‘powers-that-be’ know how different my experiences were.”
Cryoport Biopharma Customer
“When compared to other shippers, I am highly satisfied with Cryoport’s pricing and service.”
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer
“Our organization is more than impressed by our experience with Cryoport. We feel confident our material is being well-managed throughout transit. Cryoport provides extraordinary customer service and continuously they not only meet, but exceed our expectations. Late yesterday afternoon Cryoport worked tirelessly to coordinate a shipment to Japan and today seemed to effortlessly manage a late-day return. It is a pleasure working with Cryoport.”
Senior Supply Chain Analyst – Cryoport Customer
“Cryoport’s service is easy, straightforward and very convenient. We used to run into issues with transporting specimens to outside labs and Cryoport has eliminated this hurdle. Knowing Cryoport has it handled helps me sleep at night.”
Professor of Anatomy, Histology and Cell Biology – Cryoport Customer
“I'd like to commend Cryoport for their fantastic service. Our collaborator was also similarly impressed and will be recommending Cryoport to her colleagues. In addition to the great service and quality product, Cryoport’s pricing is second to none. We look forward to working with Cryoport for all of our future temperature-sensitive shipments."
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer
"I want to thank everyone at Cryoport who was involved in the rapid recovery of the missing Cryoport shipper containing a patient’s tumor tissue. By promptly locating the shipper and recharging it while in transit, the patient was able to receive the vaccine manufactured from this tissue on time. We are so very appreciative of Cryoport’s customer service. Without the services that Cryoport provides, our clinical trials would not be available to patients."
Director of Clinical Operations — Cryoport Customer
“Cryoport provides a reliable solution to ship temperature-sensitive biologics around the world. The Cryoport solution is easy for scientists to use. They respond quickly, have great customer service and anticipate problems. I am able to speak to someone 24/7 who is an expert on MY package. It is personal service focused on deep frozen life sciences. I consider Cryoport to be an extended member of my team.”
