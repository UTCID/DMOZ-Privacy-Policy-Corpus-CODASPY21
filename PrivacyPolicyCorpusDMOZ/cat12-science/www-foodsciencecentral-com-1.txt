The length of time for which we retain personal information varies depending on the type of information.

4. Navigational Information
4.1. Cookies
Like many other commercial websites, we use cookies. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Only the website where the cookie was setup can read the cookie.
Cookies enable our website to recognise personally identifiable information you have voluntarily given us. This may be used to present you with custom web pages, or to save you time; for example, if you download a whitepaper, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to www.ifis.org, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, saving you time.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies, if you prefer.
4.2. Clear gifs (web beacons/web bugs)
We employ a software technology called clear gifs, that help us better manage www.ifis.org by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We use clear gifs in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers' personal information.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please use the 'unsubscribe' functionality on the bottom of our emails, or contact ifis@ifis.org with your request.
5. How to access and control your personal information
5.1. Reviewing, correcting, and removing your personal information
If you provide us with your personal information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:
To review the information that you have supplied to us
To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in information that you have supplied to us
To request that your information not be used to contact you
