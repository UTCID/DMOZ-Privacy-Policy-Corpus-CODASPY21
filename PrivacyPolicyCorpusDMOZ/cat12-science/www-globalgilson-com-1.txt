Privacy Policy
Our Commitment to Your Privacy
Gilson Company is committed to its customers. As part of that commitment, we protect the privacy of our customers and visitors to our web site. Gilson will not sell, rent, or otherwise disseminate any information from our website to third parties. This includes our conventional and electronic mail lists, sales information, phone numbers, and other information that may be obtained through your relationship with our company.
What Information do we Collect?  Visitors to www.globalgilson.com - IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and website activity is collected from all visitors to our site.
Catalog Requests.  If you request a catalog, we require a deliverable US or international mailing address that we can send your catalog(s) to. In addition, we ask that you provide a valid email address so that we may contact you in the event there are any problems in delivering your catalog(s). All catalogs are shipped via the United States Post Office.
Orders.  Placing an order online will require a deliverable US or International shipping address. For credit card orders, we will also require the credit card type, number, expiration date, and billing address of that credit card. We also require a valid email address and phone number for all orders so that we may contact you with any questions pertaining to your order. If you wish to establish a credit account with Gilson Company, we may require additional information to establish an account. Orders are shipped by the most effective carrier unless otherwise specified by the customer.
Questions.  If you wish to ask our customer service or technical support departments questions pertaining to our products, we require only a valid email address so that we may respond to your inquiries. You may provide a phone number if you wish to be contacted by phone instead.
Other Information.  For purposes of optimizing our site and providing security, we do collect IP addresses of our visitors. We do not link this information to any personal or sales information, nor do we make any attempt to trace the origins of IP addresses beyond establishing whether a visitor has been to our site previously. Gilson does track and collect referring sites, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. We do not store any additional information pertaining to referring sites, and the information we collect is used strictly to gauge which sites refer the most visitors to Gilson Company. Movements within our web site are tracked for purposes of determining which sections are the most popular amongst our visitors. We do not capture or save additional information beyond which pages are most frequently visited, and which paths through the site are most often used.
Mailing Lists.  When you place an order or request a catalog, you are given the opportunity to subscribe to our conventional and/or electronic mailing lists. We occasionally send mailings to inform customers of special offers, new products, trade shows, or other opportunities they may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may opt-out during the ordering process. To unsubscribe and remove yourself from the list, click here or click the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of all electronic mailings.
Phone Calls.  If you have provided your phone number to Gilson, you will be called only in the event that there is a question or problem with your order. You will not receive unsolicited sales calls from Gilson Company at any time.
How is my Information Secured?  Any part of Gilson's web site which requests or transmits personal information is protected by 128-bit SSL encryption.
Gilson owns all of the storage information on which your information resides, helping to reduce the possibility of "hackers" gaining access to your valuable data. These measures represent some of the strongest safeguards available on the Internet for securing personal data.
Who can See my Information?  All information on Gilson's web site is password-protected from both external and internal users. This means that only those employees within Gilson with a need to see your information can access it. For example, an order processing specialist will have access to the details of your order, and our accounting staff may access your information if you request credit payment terms.
