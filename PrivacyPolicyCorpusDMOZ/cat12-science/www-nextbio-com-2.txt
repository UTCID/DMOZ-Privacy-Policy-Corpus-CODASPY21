NOTICE SPECIFIC TO THIRD PARTY CONTENT
"Third Party Content" means any Content or services that are either provided by third parties (including other NextBio users) on the NextBio website, or made available on third party websites and linked to on or otherwise used in connection with the Services. Third Party Content includes Submissions made by other NextBio users.
You acknowledge that all of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Third Party Content are owned by the third party who created and/or provided such Third Party Content. You are not authorized under the Terms of Service to use that Third Party Content except as expressly permitted. Any rights you have in the Third Party Content of others must be agreed upon by you and the owner of such Third Party Content.
You represent and warrant that, except for Third Party Content that is in the public domain, you will not (1) use, reproduce, modify, publish, transmit, distribute, publicly perform or display, sell, disclose to any third party, or create derivative works based on the Third Party Content, or (2) decompile or reverse engineer any Third Party Content, without the prior written consent of the owner of such Third Party Content and without correct and complete attribution to the owner and/or author of such Third Party Content or to any other sources of such Third Party Content as may be appropriate.
You acknowledge and agree that, although NextBio may periodically screen, modify, refuse or remove certain Third Party Content, (a) NextBio is not responsible for any such Third Party Content, (b) NextBio makes no guarantees about the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of the information in such Third Party Content, and (c) NextBio assumes no responsibility for any unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading, or unlawful Third Party Content made available by other users and third parties.
Providers of Third Party Content made available through or in connection with the Services may require your agreement to additional or different license or other terms prior to your use of or access to such Third Party Content. The scope of any rights that you may have with respect to Third Party Content that you access through the Services, as well as the scope of any rights that you grant to any third party with respect to Submissions by you, must be defined and governed by an agreement between you and such third party and not between NextBio and you, or NextBio and such third party. You agree that NextBio will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of your dealings with any Third Party Content provider or with respect to any other user's use or disclosure of any of your Submissions or personally identifiable information. If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including any other customer or user), NextBio is under no obligation to become involved; however, NextBio reserves the right to monitor disputes between you and any such party in its sole discretion.
ADVERTISERS AND SPONSORS
In addition to the relationships it may have with content providers, NextBio may also display advertisements and promotions (including, without limitation, banner, badge and contextual advertising) containing information on specific products, services, or topics (collectively, "Advertisements") which may be produced at the direction of third parties ("Advertisers").
Additionally, an Advertiser may underwrite certain information or content on the Services without having any control or influence over the content itself. This arrangement is commonly known as a "Sponsorship" and under this arrangement the Advertiser is a "Sponsor."
Finally, an Advertiser may pay to enhance its placement on the Services, including by associating the Advertiser's web site or banner advertisements with specific search terms. Advertisers and Sponsors may include, but are not limited to, life science product vendors, research and educational institutions, publishing companies, and other entities.
Within the Services, Advertisements and Sponsorships are identified by the words "Advertisement," "Sponsored," or similar language.
Advertisers and Sponsors pay NextBio to promote their companies and products. On the Services, when you see an indication of an Advertisement or Sponsorship, this indicates to you that an Advertiser may have paid a fee to (a) establish a link from the Services to the Advertiser's or Sponsor's web site, product information, or other content; and/or (b) have the Advertiser's or Sponsor's name associated with other content accessible through the Services.
The presence of an Advertisement or Sponsorship is not, and shall not be construed as, any endorsement or recommendation by NextBio of the product and/or service advertised, or of the Advertiser or Sponsor.

PRIVACY AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
These Terms of Service include our Privacy Policy relating to the collection and use of your personal information.
In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect the Services and users, and to ensure the integrity and operation of NextBio's business and systems and the Services, NextBio may access and disclose any information and Content NextBio considers necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, information about users (i.e., name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic information, usage history, and Submissions.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
The links provided through the Service will let you leave the Services and the NextBio website. The linked sites are not under the control of NextBio and NextBio is not responsible for the contents of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to such sites. NextBio is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any linked site. NextBio is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by NextBio of the linked site.
INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM)
The Services and Content include information from the United States National Library of Medicine ("NLM"). Under our license with the NLM ("NLM License"), we are required to make the following disclosures to you:
NLM represents that the data provided under the NLM License were formulated with a reasonable standard of care. Except for this representation, and as otherwise specifically provided in the NLM License, NLM makes no representation or warranties, expressed or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the NLM databases, and NLM specifically disclaims any such warranties and representations.
The duplication, resale, or redistribution of data obtained under the NLM License must conform to fair use guidelines and U.S. and international copyright law. Any duplication, resale, or redistribution by NextBio or its users who provide information services or products from NLM databases obtained directly or indirectly from NextBio must also conform to NLM's quality assurance requirements, copyright constraints, and usage reports. Written approval from NLM is required before a non-U.S. licensee duplicates, resells, or redistributes NLM data (except cataloging records) to others.
Unless otherwise prohibited, organizations or institutions may download small amounts of NLM-produced citations for redistribution. For MEDLINE, this is about 1,000 per month or 12,000 records for each year of coverage. For other MEDLARS databases, it is approximately 25% of the records in the file except for AIDSLINE®, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS which may be downloaded in their entirety. Since NLM makes corrections and enhancements to and performs maintenance on these records at least annually, you should plan to replace or correct the records once a year to ensure that they are still correct and searchable as a group.
NLM databases are produced by a U.S. government agency and as such the contents are not covered by copyright domestically. They may be copyrighted outside the U.S. Some NLM produced data is from copyrighted publications of the respective copyright claimants. Users of the NLM databases are solely responsible for compliance with any copyright restrictions and are referred to the publication data appearing in the bibliographic citations, as well as to the copyright notices appearing in the original publications, all of which are incorporated by reference. Users should consult legal counsel before using NLM-produced records to be certain that their plans are in compliance with appropriate laws.
All records must be identified as being derived from NLM databases.
Some material in the NLM databases is from copyrighted publications of the respective copyright claimants. Users of the NLM databases are solely responsible for compliance with any copyright restrictions and are referred to the publication data appearing in the bibliographic citations, as well as to the copyright notices appearing in the original publications, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
NEXTBIO USE OF INFORMATION

GENERAL
These Terms of Service (which includes the Privacy Statement available at www.nextbio.com/corp/privacy_statement.nb) and any other rules posted on the Services and NextBio's website constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services, unless you have entered into a separate agreement with NextBio which expressly supersedes or supplements these Terms of Service in accordance with its terms with respect to the subject matter of such agreement.
NextBio's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of NextBio will not be considered a breach of these Terms of Service if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, war, terrorism, or any other event beyond the control of NextBio. If any provision of these Terms of Service is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Service will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Please contact us with any questions regarding these Terms of Service by e-mailing us at: info@nextbio.com.
