Brown Bag Seminar Industrial Economics
What Drives Green Capabilities? Evidence from German Firm-level Data
29.01.2021| Nils Handler, DIW Berlin
Berlin Seminar on Energy and Climate Policy
Virtual Seminar: The international politics of carbon pricing and deep decarbonization
With the Green Deal, the EU aims not only at climate neutrality by 2050, but also to stimulate economic recovery in light of the pandemic. The European Commission is currently revisiting its climate policy instruments in order to strengthen the economics of climate friendly activities and investments. A central part of the debate is the European Emission Trading System and a proposed Carbon Border...

Investing in Europe’s green and digital future
The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) – the financial pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe – has been one of the good news stories to emerge in a decade of economic uncertainty. Launched by the Juncker Commission and the EIB Group in 2014, it has gone well beyond its target of €500 billion in mobilised investments. In the meantime, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the biggest...

Report
New Policy Brief from the Climate Friendly Materials Plattform has been published: A Climate-Neutral Industry: Status of policy debate in European Member States
Clear policy strategies are essential to guide corporate decision making and effective policy to achieve decarbonisation of European industry. This brief provides a much-needed overview of the current policy landscape in five EU Member States (Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain) by investigating how the path to climate-neutral industrial production is reflected in their key national plans. ...

Report
New Policy Brief from Climate Friendly Materials Plattform has been published: Carbon Contracts for Differences: their role in European industrial decarbonisation
Carbon Contracts for Differences (CCFD) are one of the elements of the policy package developed by the Climate Friendly Materials Platform (CFMP) in order to help decarbonise European’s industry while preserving its competitiveness. CCfDs are a powerful tool for helping European industry transformation during the first stages of the transition period towards a low emission economy, and the current ...

Workshop
The role of energy storage in power sectors with fossil fuel phase-out
The phase-out of fossil fuels, and a growing use of variable renewable energy sources, increase the flexibility needs of the power sector. In this context, different energy storage technologies become more relevant. Yet the role and use of electricity storage depends on many factors, for example technology costs and availabilities, as well as the level and flexibility of sector coupling strategies...

No need for new natural gas pipelines and LNG terminals in Europe
Natural gas could play an increasing role in the German energy system following the coal exit decided in July 2020 by the German parliament. However, natural gas has no climate benefit compared to coal. What is more, Europe risks to become a battleground for the conflict between Russia and the United States. The construction of the Baltic Sea pipeline Nordstream 2 has set in motion a downward...

Research Project
Study on the possibility to set up a carbon border adjustment mechanism on selected sectors
The European Green Deal includes the goal of enshrining the long-term objective of climate neutrality by 2050 in legislation and increasing the EU’s climate by 2030. In this context, the Green Deal emphasized that “should differences in levels of ambition worldwide persist, as the EU increases its climate ambition, the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism, for...

Report
New report published: Investments in Climate Friendly Materials to Strengthen the Recovery Package
Supporting investments in climate friendly production and recycling of materials as part of the European and national Covid-19 recovery packages can both achieve the short term objective of effective recovery spending for boosting the economy and creating jobs as well as deliver climate and long-term economic benefits. In order to realize the full economic and climate benefits of investment support, ...
