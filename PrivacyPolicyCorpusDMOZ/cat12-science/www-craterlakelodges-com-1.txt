Explore the Deepest Lake in the U.S.
Crater Lake continues to inspire visitors from all around the world. 7,700 years ago, a violent eruption collapsed an ancient volcano forming what we know as of today; Crater Lake. Today, visitors marvel at the panoramic views and natural formations of Wizard Island and Phantom Ship. Whether you are looking for outdoor adventures, want to immerse yourself in nature, or simply relax and take in the views, Crater Lake awaits you.
