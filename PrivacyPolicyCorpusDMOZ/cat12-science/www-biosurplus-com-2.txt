We will store your personal data, in a form that permits us to identify you, for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the personal data is processed.  We store your personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically and reasonably feasible to remove it.  Otherwise, we will seek to delete your personal data within a reasonable timeframe upon request.
12. Your Californian Rights
For residents of California only.  Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of your Personal Data with third parties.  If you reside in California and have provided your Personal Data to BioSurplus, you may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of Personal Data to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Such requests can be submitted by sending an email to info@nullBioSurplus.com.
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.  You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.  The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).

If you are based in Europe, in certain circumstances you have rights under data protection laws in relation to personal data we hold about you—specifically:
Request access to your personal data.  You may have the right to request access to any personal data we hold about you as well as related information, including the purposes for processing the personal data, the recipients or categories of recipients with whom the personal data has been shared, where possible, the period for which the personal data will be stored, the source of the personal data, and the existence of any automated decision making.
Request correction of your personal data. You may have the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate personal data we hold about you.
Request erasure of your personal data. You may have the right to request that personal data held about you is deleted.
Request restriction of processing your personal data. You may have the right to prevent or restrict processing of your personal data.
Request transfer of your personal data. You may have the right to request transfer of personal data directly to a third party where this is technically feasible.
Where you believe that we have not complied with our obligation under this Privacy Policy or European data protection law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority.
