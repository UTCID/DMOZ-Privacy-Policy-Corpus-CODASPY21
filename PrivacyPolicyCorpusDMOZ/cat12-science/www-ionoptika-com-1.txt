The J105 SIMS combines innovative engineering with cutting edge science to create a truly unique instrument. In this video, we take a look at how the instrument works, and explore some of its many applications.
“Ionoptika have continued to innovate and express an unrelenting willingness to take on new challenges… The J105 was a truly revolutionary SIMS instrument when it hit the market and continues to deliver excellent results from a wide range of sample types.”
John FletcherProfessor, University of Gothenburg
“From the outset, Ionoptika proved to be risk-takers and willing to work closely with academia to push the boundaries of ion beam technology… From gold clusters and C60 through to water GCIBs, Ionoptika have delivered time and again on collaborations which have changed the way the community does SIMS.“
Nick LockyerProfessor, University of Manchester
“It is true to say that without this company’s willingness and enthusiasm to embrace challenging new ideas in ion beam and secondary ion mass spectrometer design, the application of SIMS to the surface characterisation of chemically complex materials would not have progressed so well.”
John VickermanEmeritus Professor, University of Manchester
