ConclusionDownloaded machine code can severely compromise the reliability
and security of any computer’s operating system. Although once there
was a time when Internet users would routinely spend hours each month
downloading new browsers, email clients, and plug-ins, that time is
fortunately drawing to an end. The current generation of Internet
software is more than adequate for most users, and today’s new
computers usually come with a wide variety of plug-ins and helper
applications preinstalled. As a result, the joys of multimegabyte
downloads over relatively slow dialup modems is quickly receding from
memory.On the other hand, few users understand the dangers that
downloaded code can pose for their computer systems. With the advent
of high-speed Internet connections provided by cable modems and DSL
lines, more and more users are likely to surf and sample not only
interesting web sites, but programs as well. Internet connections that
are always on increase the opportunities for stealthily-crafted Trojan
horse programs to do their damage without being detected.In the next chapter, we’ll explore a variety of technologies
that are designed to mitigate the dangers of downloaded code: Java,
JavaScript, Flash, and Shockwave.
