HFSPO Privacy Policy
HFSPO Privacy Policy
15 April 2019
The International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO) was established in 1989 to promote innovative, cutting edge research at the frontiers of the life sciences through international collaboration in the spirit of science without borders and for the benefit of humankind. It is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of appointees from HFSPO Members, currently Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the European Commission.
This privacy policy explains how HFSPO uses the information collected via its website (http://www.hfsp.org/ ) and via the proposal submission process based on the online application tool (https://extranet.hfsp.org/ ).
HFSPO is committed to safeguarding your personal information and this policy explains what kind of personal data we collect, store, and use from applicants and awardees of HFSP funding programs for the purpose of award selection through peer review (committee members and external reviewers), award management, and the statutory requirements for reporting to the HFSPO Members.
HFSPO will collect and use your information where it is necessary for us to pursue our statutory mandate to provide research funds and where your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
Visiting the public HFSP website (www.hfsp.org)
When you visit the HFSP website the following data are logged: your browser, operating system, IP address, the date and time of your visit, the pages visited, and the amount of data transferred.
We collect this information to monitor suspicious outside activities (hacking of the site), to diagnose problems on the HFSP site (in particular the online application platform), and to create anonymous usage statistics. HFSPO does not use this data to identify or profile people. Allowing the HFSP website and extranet platform to remain secure and robust constitutes our lawful basis for collecting the data.
The personal data is only accessible to selected HFSPO staff who, according to HFSPO internal regulations, maintain the website and the technical support staff of OCI and Prodware (third party processors of HFSPO).
The data collected via the HFSP website is located on a server in the HFSP Secretariat in Strasbourg, and is not transferred to any other party. HFSPO will keep web logs for which information is archived after 30 days. We use this information to improve our website and provide a better experience for our visitors. The information is available only to our web managers and staff who require it to perform their duties.
The teams from OCI and Prodware have access to the HFSP servers to provide regular technical support for development and fixing problems. They do not have access to treat personal data of website visitors. Further information about their privacy statements is available at https://www.oci.fr/ and https://www.prodware.fr/
