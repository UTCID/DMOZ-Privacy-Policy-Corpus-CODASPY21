This Cookie Policy explains how Stellaron, Inc. DBA Agena AstroProducts, including sister sites such as OpticalCleaners.com, AgenaSupply.com, and AstronomyConnect.com (collectively "we", "us", "our," or "Agena"), as well as our corporate affiliates use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our sites on which this Cookie Policy is posted and that are Agena-branded or operated by Agena. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. A cookie may have unique identifiers and reside, among other places, on your device, in emails we send to you, and on the Platform.
Cookies set by Agena are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than Agena are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable features or functionality provided by third parties in connection with the Platform, for example, advertising, interactive content, and analytics. The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
We may use other technologies similar to cookies like web beacons, which are sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs". These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Platform or opened an email that we have sent them. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
Our Platform may also use "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs"), which are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.
Why do we use cookies?
We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some are required for technical reasons in order for our Platform to operate. Others provide a better experience on our Platform by remembering some of your activities on the Platform (including through our plug-ins, widgets, and embedded content). Other cookies enable more relevant advertising and better analytics.
Essential Cookies. Some cookies are required for the Platform to operate, for example, in the following ways:
To identify you as being logged into the Platform

They perform functions like measuring the performance of ads, preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting ads that are based on your visits to our Platform and other sites.
