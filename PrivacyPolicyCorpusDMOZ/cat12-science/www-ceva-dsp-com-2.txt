CEVA Forward-Looking Statements. The documents contained in (or directly accessible from) this Website concerning CEVA’s future expectations, plans and prospects are “forward-looking statements”, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results that differ materially from those stated. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including, without limitation, statements to the effect that the company or its management “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans” and similar expressions) should be considered forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described, including the following:
The industries in which we license our technology may experience a challenging period of slow growth that negatively impacts and could continue to negatively impact our business and operating results;
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and as a result we could experience a loss of sales, lower prices and lower revenue;
Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including our lengthy sales cycle, and are not a meaningful indicator for future performance;
We rely significantly on revenue derived from a limited number of licensees; and
Other risks discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Factors that Could Affect Our Operating Results” in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Limitation of Liability.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, CEVA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, PROFITS OR REPUTATION, ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS OR OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE WEBSITE, EVEN IF CEVA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CEVA FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS OR OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE WEBSITE , SHALL NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS, IF ANY, ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO CEVA FOR USING THE WEBSITE WITHIN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF BRINGING A CLAIM

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless CEVA and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of, or inability to use, the Website; (ii) your User Submissions; (iii) your interaction with any Website user; or (iv) your violation of these Terms.

CEVA, in its sole discretion, has the right to terminate these Terms and/or your access to the Website, or any part thereof, immediately at any time and with or without cause (including, without any limitation, for a breach of these Terms). CEVA shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of the Website, or any part thereof. If you object to any term or condition of these Terms, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become dissatisfied with the Website in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Website. Upon termination of these Terms, you shall cease all use of the Website. This Section 17 and Sections ?6 (Intellectual Property Rights), 8 (License to User Submissions), 12 (Privacy), 13 (Warranty Disclaimers), 15 (Limitation of Liability), 16 (Indemnity) and 18 (Independent Contractors) to 20 (General) shall survive termination of these Terms.
