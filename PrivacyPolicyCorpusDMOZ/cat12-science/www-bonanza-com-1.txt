Bonanza User Agreement
Updated April, 2018
By using the bonanza.com web site (the "Website") or establishing an account with Bonanza and using the Bonanza service (the "Service"), you agree to the following terms and conditions (the "Bonanza User Agreement").
I. Overview
Importantly, although Bonanza is commonly referred to as an online marketplace, it is not a traditional "retailer." Instead, Bonanza acts as a venue to match buyers and sellers. Bonanza is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers and does not transfer legal ownership of items from the sellers to buyers. As a result, Bonanza has no control over the items advertised, or the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items.
Definitions
"Your Information" is defined as any information you provide to Bonanza or other users in the registration, in the listing process (which includes photographs and descriptions), in any public message area (including the Forums or the feedback area) or through any email feature. You are solely responsible for Your Information, and Bonanza acts as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Information.
"Your Activities" include, for example, listing items, posting comments in any public message area (including the Forums or the feedback area), and email.
Dispute Resolution
Bonanza's goal is to make you happy. In the event a dispute arises between you and Bonanza, please email Bonanza at support@bonanza.com and we will work quickly towards a solution. We encourage you to report all user-to-user disputes to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or a certified mediation or arbitration entity.
General Overview: Terms
You acknowledge that you must be 18 years or older to use this site or establish an account.
You acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for keeping your password secure.
You agree not to use
Bonanza for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
You agree to comply with
all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.
You are solely
responsible for your conduct and any data, text, information, screen
names, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, links or any
other content that you submit, post or display on the Website.
You agree not to modify,
adapt or hack bonanza.com or modify another website so as to falsely
imply that it is associated with Bonanza.
You agree not to solicit,
harass or impersonate Bonanza members.
You agree not to transmit
any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.
Furthermore, while Bonanza discourages certain conduct and content on the Website, you acknowledge and agree the Website is a venue and as such is not responsible for the content posted on it. You agree to use the Website at your own risk.
General Overview: Conditions
Bonanza reserves the
right to modify or terminate any service for any reason at any time, with
or without notice.
Bonanza reserve the
right to alter this Bonanza User Agreement at any time. If alterations
constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, to be determined at the
sole discretion of Bonanza, Bonanza will notify you via e mail according
to the preference expressed on your account.
Bonanza reserves the
right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
Bonanza may remove
content (by way of example but without limitation: items, item
descriptions, chat text, booth text, and information submitted in the
forums) that Bonanza determines is
unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene or
otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property, Bonanza
Terms of Use, Bonanza Privacy Policy, or any other policy documents and
community guidelines as posted on Bonanza. Bonanza has no obligation to do so,
however.
The Service makes it
possible to post images hosted on Bonanza to outside websites. This use
is accepted. However, pages on other websites which display images hosted
on Bonanza must provide a link back to Bonanza from each photo to its
photo page on Bonanza.
Bonanza will terminate
your account without notice if your account is used for hosting graphic
elements of web page designs, icons, smilies, buddy icons, forum avatars,
badges and other non-photographic elements on external websites.
You can remove your
profile at any time by deleting your account. This will also remove any
private images you have stored in the system. By uploading images and item
description content to Bonanza, you agree to allow other Bonanza users to view them and you agree to allow Bonanza to display the images and content on Bonanza, or in emails from Bonanza, and store the images, item description, profile and
other content.
All Bonanza graphics,
logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are
registered or unregistered trademarks or service marks. Bonanza's trademarks or name may not be
used, including as part of trademarks and/or as part of domain names, in
connection with any product or service in any manner that is likely to
cause confusion.
II. Membership Eligibility
Bonanza's services are free, but available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Bonanza's services are not available to children (persons under the age of 18) or to temporarily or indefinitely suspended Bonanza members. If you are a under the age of 18, you can use this service only in conjunction with, and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. If you do not qualify, please do not use Bonanza. Further, you also agree not to transfer or sell your account (including feedback) or User ID.
III. Purchasing/Buyer Obligations and Guidelines
A buyer is obligated to complete the transaction of a purchase of an item on Bonanza in any shop within three (3) days. A buyer is obligated to immediately pay in full if using PayPal or Amazon Pay by clicking the payment button during checkout.
A seller must abide by all of Bonanza's policies and the seller's own individual shop policies and sell and the item as described. Likewise, a seller must abide by the seller's own individual policies when dealing other issues, for example, issues of damage and returns.
Buyers remorse is not a valid reason for requesting a refund from a seller. Prior to making a purchase, buyers should review
all sellers policies regarding refunds, returns, and seller policies.
IV. Listing/Seller Obligations and Guidelines
Bonanza's Fees and Credit Policy
Changes to the Fees and Credits Policy and the fees for our services are effective after Bonanza provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the changes by posting the changes on Bonanza. However, Bonanza may choose to temporarily change Bonanza's Fees and Credits Policy and the fees for Bonanza's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days) and such changes are effective when Bonanza posts the temporary promotional event on Bonanza. Bonanza may, at Bonanza's sole discretion, change some or all of Bonanza's services at any time. In the event Bonanza introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars (USD).
Unless granted an exception by Bonanza, Bonanza requires all seller accounts to provide a credit or debit card for the purposes of verification of their identity, and for payment of fees and services rendered.
You are responsible for paying all fees associated with using Bonanza's service and Bonanza and all applicable taxes. If a seller owes more than $3.00 USD in fees at the beginning of the month, they are emailed an invoice detailing the amount due. Payment for the amount due must be made in full within 30 days of the date on the invoice.
Fees for our services will be described once they are determined.
Listing Description: You must be legally able to sell the item(s) you list for sale on the Site. You must describe your item and all terms of sale on the listing page of the Site. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All listed items must be listed in an appropriate category. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing. Listings may not contain outbound links that direct users off of Bonanza.
Binding Sale: All sales are binding. If you, as a seller, receive a purchase request (order) you are obligated to complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of your listing (such as payment method), or (b) you cannot authenticate the buyer's identity.
Termination: Without limiting any other remedies, Bonanza, without notice, may suspend or terminate your account if Bonanza suspects, in its sole discretion, that you (by information, investigation, conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise) have violated any of Bonanza's policies set out in this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or any other policy documents or community guidelines, or you have engaged in an improper or fraudulent activity in connection with Bonanza. If Bonanza terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your seller fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Bonanza for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, Bonanza reserves the right to attempt to collect past due fees by charging the seller's card on file. The seller risks additional penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Bonanza support.
Manipulation: The price stated in each Bonanza Item Description must be an accurate representation of the sale.
Manipulation refers to activities whereby the price no longer accurately represents the monetary value of the transaction. For example manipulative activities include, but are not limited to, intentionally stating one price in the Item Description but charging a higher price to the buyer, altering the item's price prior to a sale for the purpose of avoiding Bonanza transaction fees, and hacking into another's account and altering prices. Neither buyer nor seller, may manipulate the price of any item for any reason.
Sellers have up to 90 days from the date of the transaction to request refunds on the final value fees. Final value fee refund
requests on transactions outside of 90 days will not be honored.
V. Usage Guidelines
Third Party Content; Identity Verification: You understand that the Bonanza, including Bonanza booth chat, acts only as a marketing platform and technical interface between users and that Bonanza does not itself verify the qualifications of users, nor does it evaluate or control in any ongoing manner exchanges between users. Any opinions or statements expressed by a user are of those of the user alone, and are not to be attributed to Bonanza. Bonanza cannot and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, safety, reliability, timeliness, innocuousness, legality or applicability of anything said, written, posted, displayed or otherwise made available by any user.
You understand that you may be exposed to content that you find offensive to you, and that you use the Bonanza at your own risk.
Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe trading when using Bonanza. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense. Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with international trade and foreign nationals. By using Bonanza, you agree to accept such risks and that Bonanza (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of users on Bonanza
Bonanza uses many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information Bonanza's users provide to Bonanza when they register on Bonanza. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Bonanza cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, Bonanza has established a user-initiated feedback system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. Bonanza also encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on Bonanza. You may also wish to consider using a third party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Usage; Restricted Activities: Your Activities which results in Your Information (or any items listed) on Bonanza shall not:
(a) be false, inaccurate or misleading;
(b) be fraudulent or involve the sale of illegal, counterfeit, stolen items or items which violate the Terms of Use in any way;
(c) infringe upon any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary or intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy, including but not limited to specific prohibition against users Listing, selling or distributing any Digital Version of textbooks on or through the Website;
(d) violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising); Bonanza also does not permit the listing of items that have been identified by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) as hazardous to consumers and therefore subject to a recall;
(e) be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing;
(f) be obscene or contain child pornography
(g) contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information;
(h) create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers; and
(i) link directly or indirectly to or include descriptions of goods or services that:
(aa) are prohibited under this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or other policy documents and community guidelines as posted on Bonanza or;
(bb) are identical to other items you have for sale but are priced lower;
(cc) are concurrently listed for sale on a web site other than Bonanza's (this does not prevent linking to or advertising an Bonanza item from another web site); or
(dd) you do not have a right to link to or include.
(ee) have pricing deemed to be excessive on specific items needed for the health and well-being of the general populace in times of emergency or other market disruptions that cause a shortage of some goods.
Furthermore, you may not list any item on Bonanza (or consummate any transaction that was initiated using our service) that, by paying to us the listing fee or the final value fee, could cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or that violates the Terms of Use.
Access and Interference: Bonanza may contain robot exclusion headers. Much of the information on Bonanza is updated on a real time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to Bonanza by Bonanza's users or third parties. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access Bonanza for any purpose without our prior express written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not:
(i) take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
(ii) copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute or publicly display any content from the Site without the prior expressed written permission of Bonanza and the appropriate third party, as applicable;
(iii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site; or
(iv) bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to Bonanza.
Feedback Integrity; Feedback Export: You may not take any actions that may undermine the integrity of the feedback system. Bonanza may, without prior notice, limit the number of purchases and listings, which you may place on Bonanza based upon the level of your feedback. If you earn a low percentage feedback rating, your account will automatically be flagged for staff review, at which time your membership may be fully or partially suspended, and you may be unable to list or buy.
You acknowledge that your feedback consists of comments left by other users and a composite feedback number compiled by Bonanza. Further, you acknowledge that the composite number, without the feedback comments, does not convey your full user reputation. Because feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for facilitating transactions between Bonanza users, you agree that you shall not market or export your Bonanza feedback rating in any venue other than a Bonanza operated website.
VI. Bonanza Rewards / Tokens
Bonanza Tokens ("Tokens") are not redeemable for cash and have no cash or monetary value. Tokens are purely promotional in nature, are only for members and only part of the Service through the Website or as otherwise specifically designated and approved by Bonanza, and do not constitute a property right or interest or confer any such right or interest to you. Tokens may be redeemed immediately or accrued over time, up to a maximum of 12 months. Tokens will expire on a rolling monthly basis if not redeemed within 12 months of being awarded, and Bonanza has no obligation to notify you of any such expiration.

Bonanza Background Burner will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
You will retain all rights to any image you submit to the Background Burner for processing.
The Bonanza engineering team may re-process images you submit to the Background Burner in order to improve quality of the tool over time.
You assume full responsibility for the images you submit, process, and download. If your image was copyrighted before you burned it, it
will be copyrighted after you burn it. In general, you are bound by law not to use an image unless you own the copyright for it.
Bonanza takes no responsibility for how you choose to use your image after downloading it.
Because we do not charge for use of the Background Burner until the image has been reviewed by the seller, all purchases made using this tool
are final.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BACKGROUND BURNER MAY REMOVE ESSENTIAL DETAILS FROM YOUR PRODUCT IMAGE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING
THAT YOUR PROCESSED IMAGE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE POSTING IT FOR SALE.

(b) Bonanza is unable to verify or authenticate any of Your Information; or
(c) Bonanza believes that your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability for you, Bonanza's users or Bonanza.

BONANZA, BONANZA'S SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND BONANZA'S SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Indemnification: YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD BONANZA AND (AS APPLICABLE) BONANZA'S PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES, HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY DUE TO OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DOCUMENTS IT INCORPORATES BY REFERENCE, OR YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR THE RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.
