We may also collect information relating to your employment, including where you are currently employed, your job title, registration details, salary band, areas of interest/expertise and your job function if this is relevant to your membership. In applications for some categories of membership we ask you to identify a referee and to provide contact information for them.
When purchasing a product, your credit card details are also collected, and are temporarily stored until we have processed your order. How we handle your personal information The ACB respects the privacy of its members, customers and website users, and aims to act consistently within applicable legislation.

Use and disclosure The ACB’s policy is not to disclose any personal information that we hold on you to any unrelated third party, except where you have given your express consent for us to do so or where required by law.
Arrangements are occasionally made with suppliers of goods and services (such as other scientific societies for their mailings to be sent to members). All material is carefully vetted and the mailing list is never released to third parties. The ACB may use your email address for the purpose of notifying you about products, services, events or activities of relevance to you. If you tell us that you do not wish us to use your personal information for a particular purpose, we will not do so. Personal information will be used only for the purpose stated at the point of collection (such as the processing of grant applications) and such information will be held for as long as necessary to fulfil the stated purpose.
