Privacy policy
The National Physical Laboratory (“NPL”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

The website www.npl.co.uk is owned and operated by NPL. By continuing to use the Website and by submitting information to our Website, you are accepting the practices described in this policy.
NPL collects information that you provide to us directly, including (e.g. names, email addresses, and etc), and other information, including (e.g. addresses, age group, and etc.), to enable us to deliver our products and services (e.g. fundraising, goods advertising, and etc.).

Personal data
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Data Protection Act 2018 ('the Act'), personal data is defined as 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'), by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person'.
Lawful processing
The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. At least one of these must apply whenever personal data is to be processed:
(a) Consent: you have given NPL (e.g. any of the following depending on the situation freely, specific, informed or unambiguous) consent for your personal data to be processed for a specific purpose.
(b) Contract performance: the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract you have with NPL, which had asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.
(c) Compliance with legal obligation: the processing is necessary for NPL to comply with the law (e.g. the tax/social security obligation/employment law) (not including contractual obligations).
(d) Protection of vital interests: the processing is vital to an individual's survival.
(e) Public interest: the processing is necessary for NPL to perform a task that is in the public interest or for its official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.
(f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for NPL legitimate interests, or the legitimate interests of a third-party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data that overrides those legitimate interests.

contacting us with enquiries or comments by telephone, email or hard copy correspondence.
Personal data may be given to us through another organisation with which you have registered, and we may be required to process that data in order to fulfil services that you expect of us. This could include one of the following:
via another authorised body with whom joint education or professional development takes place
via professional bodies with whom there is a sharing of registration for events or activities
How we use your personal data

Sharing your personal data
We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the organisation, or other individuals. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of safeguarding or other statutory regulations we have to comply with as well as those organisations with whom you and we have reciprocal agreements for providing services for education or professional development.

We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees' privacy responsibilities.
How long we store your personal data for
We store your personal data in accordance with our data retention policy. This policy is reviewed and updated internally to ensure we do not store your data for longer than is necessary. We also review how and where we store any data to ensure that we meet our obligation to store data securely.
In addition, some of the data we hold may be subject to certain legal and regulatory obligations, which provide a minimum retention period for different types of data. The retention period varies depending on the data we hold.
