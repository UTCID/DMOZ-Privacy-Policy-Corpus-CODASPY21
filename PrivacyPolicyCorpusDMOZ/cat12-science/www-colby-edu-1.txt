When this Privacy Policy Applies
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other non-College materials, solicitations, websites, or services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. In particular, the Website may contain links to other non-College websites or direct you to other websites when you use certain functionality on the Website, such as when you want to fill out an application for admission to the College. Once you have used these links and/or been redirected to leave our Website, we do not have any control over the other websites you visit and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting such websites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to other linked websites.
Colby College is located in the United States and is subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere and you voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in this Privacy Policy.
What Information Does the College Collect?

We also receive and store your username(s) and password(s) when you login through the Site. We use a third-party to process payments for some of the services we offer that we describe on the Website, and so we do not directly receive and store your payment information (including your credit card information), although we do have access to this information through our third-party provider.
Automatic Information generated from user interaction with the site. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies” (which are discussed in more detail below). We also use Google Analytics, which collects additional site usage data (this is also discussed in more detail below).
Information obtained by third party vendors. We receive and store information you provide to external entities including, but not limited to, the College Board, Student Search Service®, ACT, NRCCUA, Carnegie Communications, RaiseMe, YouVisit, CIS University Connection Registry, and other third parties vendors associated with the college search process.

Disclosure of User Information to Third Parties
Your information may be shared with contractors and/or other third-party partners to the extent necessary for those organizations to provide services to us or to users. Any such organizations which receive user information for this purpose are required to keep the information confidential and only use it to provide services to the College or our Site users, such as you.
We may also provide your information to third parties in the following circumstances:
If you have provided us with consent to do so;
We are legally required to do so, for example, in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process;
It is necessary to protect the legal rights, privacy, or safety of our organization, its subsidiaries, and/or affiliates, or our employee, agents, and/or contractors;
To protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes;
To protect the safety and security of visitors to the Website;
To permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that you may sustain; and/or
To enforce the Terms of Use.
We also may share aggregate, non-personal information about website usage with third parties. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information about our users.
How We Protect Information
We exercise great care to protect your personal information. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption (when appropriate), and intrusion detection. In addition, we limit our employees’ and contractors’ access to personal information. Only those employees and contractors with a business reason to know have access to this information. We also educate our employees about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of your information.
While we strive to protect the information you provide to us, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email as we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the same security features that are built into our Website.
If you have any questions about how we protect your information, please forward them to dataprivacy@colby.edu
Controlling Your Personal Information
People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect and what we do with it so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.

If you are located within the European Union, you have the right to be informed of the College’s use of personal information, request access to personal information, correct inaccuracies, and request the erasure of personal information. These rights are subject to certain limitations. Exercising these rights is a guarantee to be provided a process and not an outcome. If you choose to exercise these rights or have questions about these rights you may contact us at dataprivacy@colby.edu.  Requests initiated by third parties must be validated by the data subject, including validation of the data subject’s identity.
