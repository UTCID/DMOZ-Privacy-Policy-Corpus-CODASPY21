SEA Donor Privacy Policy
Sea Education Association respects the privacy of its donors and has put in place a Donor Privacy Policy to honor your rights.
Sea Education Association collects and uses personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, and email address when a donor voluntarily provides it to us. This information is kept on file for IRS purposes and is also used in our development and communication activities.
Sea Education Association does NOT sell, trade, or share its donor list with any other organization. Sea Education Association never sends out mailings on behalf of other organizations.
Sea Education Association subscribes to the Donor Bill of Rights.
The Donor Bill of Rights
The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel (AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). It has been endorsed by numerous organizations.
The Donor Bill of Rights
Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.
IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.
Why Give?
Sea Education Association has enjoyed more than four decades of education under sail. From our first program in 1971 aboard Westward to the construction of our campus in 1985, a second ship in 1988 (the Corwith Cramer), and the launch and commissioning of the Robert C. Seamans in 2001, SEA's reputation continues to grow.
