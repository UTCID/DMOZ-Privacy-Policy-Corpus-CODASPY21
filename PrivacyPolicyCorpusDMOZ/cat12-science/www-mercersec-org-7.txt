The Mercer Science and Engineering Club is a 501(c)3 charitable, tax exempt organization (see attachment). Our sponsors provide the funds to run the fair and provide the awards given to the students. There is no charge for a student to participate in the fair.
The club is an all volunteer organization that manages the fair. We handle the competition, manage the judges and support the award winners. Judges may be club members but you do not have to be a club member to be a judge.
We are always looking for new members to help with the fair. Please contact us if you would like to learn more about help foster STEM education in Mercer County, NJ.
