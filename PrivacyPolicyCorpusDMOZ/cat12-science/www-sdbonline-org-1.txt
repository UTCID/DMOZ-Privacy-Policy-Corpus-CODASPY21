Science Policy Issues
The Society for Developmental Biology engages with science policy issues that impact the ability of our members and other scientists to conduct high-quality research, train the next generation of scientists, and help educate the general public about important scientific issues. Here you will find resources resources that support these goals—many from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) of which SDB is a member society.
Research Funding
The research programs of SDB members rely on funding from a variety of government sources including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE SC), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Each year, FASEB makes recommendations to the U.S. Congress about the level of federal funding needed for these agencies to fulfill their missions and drive important advances in the life and biomedical sciences.  FASEB has created many tools to help individuals educate themselves and others about the impact federally funded science has on their local districts and states.  These are useful tools for advocating for federal funding in your area of research.
