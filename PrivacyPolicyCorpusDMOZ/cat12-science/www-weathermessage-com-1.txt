of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
and so on. When you return to the same Weather Message Software LLC Web site, the information
you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Weather Message Software LLC
features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
the interactive features of the Weather Message Software LLC services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Weather Message Software LLC secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. Weather Message Software LLC secures the personally identifiable information
