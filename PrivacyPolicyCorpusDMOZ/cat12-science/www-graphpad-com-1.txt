SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS
A subscription allows registered members (and individuals authorized by the registered member to access the Service) (hereafter, “Authorized User” or “Authorized Users”) to access the Service. No matter the role, a subscription is required for each Authorized User. A subscription may be procured through the GraphPad interface (i.e. online checkout process), or in some cases, via an order form entered into between registered member and us (hereafter, the “Order Form”). Please see How to Buy for more information on procuring subscriptions and adding new Authorized Users. Each Authorized User must agree to the Terms of Use to activate their subscription. Subscriptions commence when we make them available to the registered member and continue for the term agreed upon and as applicable. Each subscription is for a single Authorized User for a specified term and is personal to that Authorized User. We sometimes enter into other kinds of ordering arrangements, but that would need to be spelled out and agreed to in an Order Form. During an active subscription term, adding more subscriptions is simple. Unless the Order Form says otherwise, registered members may purchase more subscriptions at the same price stated in the Order Form and all will terminate on the same date. Please note these additional terms and conditions for Subscriptions:
To obtain a subscription, you will need to (1) enter your billing account information, (2) select a monthly, multi-month (e.g. 3-month or 6-month) or annual subscription and (3) select the number of Authorized Users.
Please note by purchasing a subscription, you (individually or on behalf of the organization or business entity who you represent) are agreeing to pay and authorize GraphPad to automatically charge your credit card the applicable fee shown on the Order Form each month (or year if applicable) unless and until you cancel.
Unless an Order Form says something different, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need to go through the GraphPad interface or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter; and (b) the per-authorized user pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term.
By way of example, if you initially purchased an annual subscription for five (5) Authorized Users, but increased the numbers of Authorized Users to ten (10) before the end of that annual period, your subscription renewal will incur a charge of the annual subscription fee (at the then-current price) for the then-current 10 Authorized Users.
Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscription from automatically renewing. Absent cancellation or non-renewal, your subscription will be automatically renewed and billed for an additional period of the chosen subscription (whether monthly, multi-month or annual) upon the expiration of the applicable period.
Subscriptions that are billed on a monthly, multi-month or annual basis must be canceled prior to the applicable automatic recurring billing date in order to avoid being charged an additional fee for the applicable period. We will save your credit card information for use on all future purchases. All subscription charges are not refundable or prorated upon cancellation.
If your payment method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your credit card information or cancel your account, you authorize us to continue billing that credit card on file including extending the expiration date until we are notified by you or the credit card company that the account is no longer valid. We encourage you to constantly update your payment method information or cancel your account should you wish to discontinue your membership with us.
If you wish to cancel your subscription, you must contact GraphPad before the 10th day of each month (for monthly subscriptions) or the 10th day prior to the commencement of the new multi-month or yearly period using one of the following methods:
Visit help.graphpad.com; or
By telephone at +1 (858) 454-5577 between the hours of 9:00am PST to 5:00pm PST on Monday through Friday
GraphPad reserves the right to modify prices charged for subscriptions (whether monthly, multi-month or annual) by providing notice to you of the pricing change. However, that pricing change will not apply until your existing subscription period (whether monthly, multi-month or annual) expires. The pricing change will take effect upon subscription renewal.
Subscription fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Registered members are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its/his/her purchases.
PRISM PERPETUAL LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
By purchasing a Prism perpetual license or upgrade through the GraphPad.com website, directly from GraphPad's official sales office, any of GraphPad's affiliates (such as resellers), or other authorized third parties, you are entitled to download and install the specific Prim major version purchased (for example, Prism 8), and any minor updates for that major version available at the time of purchase (for example, Prism 8.1.0).  Each perpetual license grants you one serial number, which can only be activated on a single physical device or virtual client. You must purchase separate perpetual licenses for each device or virtual client that you wish to activate.  Visit help.graphpad.com if you need to re-activate a license on a different device.  Your license does not include upgrades to newer or future major versions (for example, if you purchased Prism 8, you may not upgrade to Prism 9 for free, or any other future major versions).  Furthermore, GraphPad does not guarantee any software updates after the time of purchase, and you agree to waive all claims to any available software updates (including, but not limited to, bug fixes and minor features) released beyond one year after your original license purchase date.  You accept GraphPad's right to review license usage and revise its terms from time to time to ensure compliance, and that GraphPad may revoke and disable any licenses (and associated activations) that are deemed to be in violation of the aforementioned terms.  In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and any other agreement, these terms and conditions shall prevail.

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
We offer the following process to help you resolve a complaint or Dispute (as defined below) that you may have with GRAPHPAD or its Third Party Providers in connection with the use of this Service.  Please read this section carefully. Our Customer Service Department, which you can reach at help.graphpad.com can help you resolve most of your concerns. If our Customer Service Department is unable to resolve your complaint or Dispute, you agree to take the following steps to resolve any Dispute you may have with us.
Step 1. Notice of Dispute
You must first try to resolve any complaint or Dispute with us through our Notice of Dispute process. You begin by submitting a “Notice of Dispute” with any supporting documents or other information by U.S. Mail to:
GRAPHPAD SOFTWARE, LLC
Attention: Notice of Dispute
2365 Northside Dr.
Suite 560
San Diego, CA 92108
A “Notice of Dispute” is a written form in which you provide your name, address, contact information, email address, the facts regarding your Dispute, and the relief you are requesting from us.  Once we receive your Notice of Dispute, you and we will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within forty-five (45) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is received by us. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or we may initiate an arbitration proceeding or small claims action as described below.
You agree that the term “Dispute” in these Terms of Use will have the broadest meaning possible. It applies to any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and us relating to the Website, the Services, the Terms of Use (or any breach thereof) – whether in contract, warranty, tort, laws or regulation. The term also applies to any dispute over the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration provision.
Step 2: Arbitration
If your Dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 45 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you and we agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us.  As explained below, you and we also may also have the right to bring an individual action before a Small Claims Court for certain claims. You agree that arbitration or a small claims action will be your sole and exclusive remedy to resolve any dispute with us. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement.
By agreeing to arbitrate, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) any and all Disputes in a court before a judge or jury (except Small Claims Court). Instead, a neutral arbitrator will resolve all Disputes.
To read more about arbitration, visit www.adr.org. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at that time. You can review the Consumer Arbitration Rules here: https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf. You may begin an arbitration with us by completing a Demand for Arbitration form, available by clicking here: https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Demand%20for%20Arbitration.pdf. The completed form(s) should be returned directly to the AAA. The AAA will assign someone to manage your case. You will be contacted with instructions for continuing the arbitration process. Be sure to keep a copy of everything you send to the administrator of your arbitration or us.  If, for any reason, the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum which will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA rules will determine whether the arbitration will take place through written submissions by you and us, by telephone, or in person.
Class Action Waiver
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your Dispute with other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity or as a private attorney general are not permitted and are waived by you, and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims. If a court or arbitrator finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.
Costs
If you initiate an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, we will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee you may have been required to pay by the AAA, once you have notified us in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration demand. However, if we are the prevailing party in the arbitration, we will be entitled to seek and recover our attorneys’ fees and costs, subject to the arbitrator’s determination and applicable law.
Small Claims Option
You may also litigate any Dispute in Small Claims Court in the County of Los Angeles, California, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You can learn more about the Small Claims Court in the County of Los Angeles by clicking here: http://www.lacourt.org/division/smallclaims/smallclaims.aspx.  However, if you initiate a Small Claims case, you are responsible for all your court costs.
Choice of Law and Forum Selection
You agree that the laws of the State of California govern this agreement and any claim or Dispute or issues arising from it, without regard to California’s conflict of laws rules. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or Dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any Disputes or claims that you may have against us reside in and will be resolved by a state or federal court located in the County of Los Angeles in the State of California and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.
Governing Law & Exclusive Venue
Use of the Service and any claim relating to GraphPad shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and litigated in the State of California.  Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California. The choice of law of and exclusive venue in California apply to you regardless of where you are accessing the Website from even if you are accessing the Website from outside of the United States of America.

GraphPad reserves the right to change these Terms of Use or policies relating to the Service at any time and from time to time, and such changes will be effective upon being posted herein.  You should visit this page from time to time to review the then current Terms of Use because they are binding on you. Certain provisions of these Terms of Use may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages of the Website, which may be posted from time to time. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes and/or postings shall constitute your consent to such changes. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.
You may not assign these Terms of Use without the prior written approval of GraphPad.  Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void. GraphPad reserves the right to use third party providers in the provision of the Service and/or Materials associated therewith.  In the event of any litigation of any controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, its interpretation, its performance, or the like, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses attributable to the prosecution or defense of that controversy or dispute.  Any and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by GraphPad.
