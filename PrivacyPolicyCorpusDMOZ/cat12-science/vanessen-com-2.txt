1.1 The sale of products and services by Van Essen Instruments B.V. – Canadian Division (“Van Essen”) is governed by these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”). Van Essen’s offer to sell products and services to the buyer (“Buyer”) is expressly limited by Buyer’s acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, as evidenced by Buyer’s issuance of an order for product(s) and/or services, or Buyer’s acceptance of any product and/or services under an order, or Buyer’s payment for any product and/or services under an order. These Terms and Conditions apply to the exclusion of any other terms that Buyer seeks to impose or incorporate or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing. Terms, if any, included on any order, acknowledgment forms or other documents issued by or on behalf of Buyer shall not apply and are hereby voided, except to the extent that any such terms are expressly agreed to in writing by Van Essen. These Terms and Conditions shall apply to all sales of products and services by Van Essen and may only be modified or amended in a writing executed by an authorized officer of Van Essen.
1.2 These Terms and Conditions are subject to change without prior written notice at any time at Van Essen’s sole discretion, provided that any such changes shall not apply to any pre-existing orders.
1.3 Any offer by Van Essen to sell products and supply services must be in writing to be valid, and such offer shall be valid for thirty (30) days from its date of issuance, unless otherwise set forth in such offer. Such offer shall be deemed accepted only upon Van Essen’s receipt of Buyer’s written acceptance of such offer, provided that such acceptance is in accordance with Van Essen’s offer and these Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise accepted by Van Essen in writing.
1.4 No order for product(s) and/or services shall be binding on Van Essen unless and until it has been accepted in writing by Van Essen.

2.2 If the currency fixed in an order is devalued, such that the rate of exchange between the currency chosen and Pounds Sterling varies by more than two percent (2%) as from the date of Van Essen’s offer, Van Essen may, at its sole discretion, suspend all performance under the order and notify Buyer of any price adjustment resulting from the devaluation. Buyer must then notify Van Essen in writing within eight (8) days of the date of Van Essen’s notification whether Buyer wishes to purchase the products and services at the adjusted price. If Buyer fails to notify Van Essen during such eight (8) day period, then Buyer’s order will be automatically cancelled. Van Essen shall not be liable for any costs or losses of Buyer attributable to such cancellation.
2.3 Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, payment of the price for the products and/or services to be supplied pursuant to an order shall be effected on the due date indicated on the invoice or in absence of such date specified, 30 days of the date of Van Essen’s invoice.
2.4 Buyer shall not be entitled to exercise any set-off, lien or any other similar right or claim against any amounts due to Van Essen for any reason.

Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Van Essen’s sole and exclusive obligation, in the event of any failure of products to comply with this warranty shall be for Van Essen to, at its option, repair or replace such products free of charge. In no event shall Van Essen be liable for ordinary wear and tear.
8.2 Van Essen does not provide any warranty for third-party parts, components or products that are not manufactured by Van Essen. Such parts, components or products may be warranted by third parties on a “pass through” basis.

Buyer shall interpret and/or use such data entirely at its own responsibility and shall indemnify Van Essen against claims, losses or obligations arising in connection with the interpretation and/or use of the data.
8.4 The foregoing remedies shall not apply to any product failure, defect or non-conformance caused in whole or in part by (i) Buyer’s failure to operate, maintain or service the products in accordance with Van Essen’s Documentation or (if there is none) good trade practice regarding the same, (ii) any alteration, modification or repair made to the products other than by Van Essen, (iii) use of the products for a purpose other than that for which they are intended, (iv) Van Essen following any drawing, design or specification supplied by Buyer, or using any materials and items supplied by or on behalf of Buyer; (v) fair wear and tear, wilful damage, negligence, or abnormal storage or working conditions, (vi) the products differ from their description as a result of changes made to ensure they comply with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements; or (vii) circumstances not attributable to Van Essen (such as condition of the soil or well). Van Essen shall not be liable for products’ failure to comply with the warranty set out in this Section 8 if Buyer makes any further use of such products after giving notice in accordance with this Section 8.
8.5 In order to get the benefit of the foregoing warranty, Buyer must immediately inspect the products upon receipt and notify Van Essen in writing immediately after discovering any defect or shortcoming. Buyer shall not ship products back to Van Essen for any reason without Van Essen’s prior written consent, evidenced by a valid return material authorization (“RMA”). No returns will be permitted without a valid RMA. Any products returned to Van Essen must be received by Van Essen within 10 days of Buyer’s receipt of an RMA. Notwithstanding the issuance of an RMA, Van Essen reserves the right to inspect the products at its facility and to refuse, at its sole discretion, to accept the return of any item if Van Essen determines that the products’ warranty is not applicable for the reasons set forth above. Any defective products or parts forwarded by Buyer to Van Essen for repair or replacement, shall be carriage paid and at Buyer’s risk.

If Van Essen replaces parts/products in fulfilment of its warranty obligations, the replaced parts/products shall become the property of Van Essen.

8.7 THE FOREGOING EXPRESS WARRANTIES ARE THE EXCLUSIVE TERMS AVAILABLE TO BUYER AND EXTEND ONLY TO THE ORIGINAL CUSTOMER OF VAN ESSEN OR VAN ESSEN’S AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR, AS THE CASE MAY BE. THE CORRECTION OF ANY DEFECT IN OR FAILURE OF PRODUCTS BY REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH VAN ESSEN’S POLICIES AS DESCRIBED HEREIN SHALL BE VAN ESSEN’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATION AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, DELAYS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE PURCHASE OR USE OF VAN ESSEN’S PRODUCTS. OTHER THAN THE LIMITED WARRANTY SPECIFICALLY STATED HEREIN, VAN ESSEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO VAN ESSEN’S PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED TO BUYER, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.

In no event shall Van Essen’s total aggregate liability for any and all damages, losses or liabilities arising hereunder or from the supply of products and/or services exceed the amounts actually received by Van Essen from Buyer with respect to such products and/or services giving rise to the liability.

10.2 Receiving Party shall not, without the prior consent of Van Essen, disclose any of the Confidential Information to anyone for any reason at any time or use any of the Confidential Information for any purpose except as requested by Van Essen. If Receiving Party believes in good faith that it is required by the law of any relevant jurisdiction or pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or that of a competent regulatory authority to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it shall provide notice to Van Essen prior to making such disclosure so as to allow Van Essen time to undertake legal or other action to prevent such disclosure or otherwise obtain confidential treatment of such disclosure. In no event will Receiving Party disclose any of the Confidential Information that Receiving Party is not compelled to disclose by law, and Receiving Party will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any of the Confidential Information so disclosed.
10.3 Receiving Party shall limit dissemination of the Confidential Information to only those of Receiving Party having a “need to know”, and advise each such person who receives the Confidential Information that such information is confidential and require each such person (other than attorneys and other agents who are already under a professional duty of confidentiality) to sign and comply with a written agreement obligating it/he/she to observe all of Receiving Party’s obligations hereunder relating to confidentiality, non-disclosure and restrictions on use.
Article 11: Force Majeure

If Van Essen reasonably determines that any such delay in performance is likely to extend for a period of ninety (90) days or more, Van Essen shall have the right to cancel the applicable order upon notice to Buyer with no liability or further obligation to Buyer with respect to such order.
Article 12: Assignment & Subcontracting

Article 13: Severance
13.1 If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of these Terms and Conditions (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall not be affected.
Article 14: Waiver
14.1 A waiver of any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms and Conditions or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
Article 15: Applicable Law
15.1 These Terms and Conditions and any dispute or claim arising hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, and the courts of Ontario shall have jurisdiction to entertain any action arising hereunder.

9.1 To the extent permitted by law, Van Essen shall not be liable under any contract, tort, strict liability, negligence or other legal or equitable claim or theory for any special, incidental, consequential or indirect damages or for loss of goodwill or business profits, lost revenue, work stoppage (production or business interruptions or standstills), computer failure or malfunction, or for any and all other exemplary or punitive damages arising hereunder or from the use of products, including, without limitation, any such loss or damage relating to personal injury or property damage, even if Van Essen has been advised or was aware of the possibility of such loss or damages. In no event shall Van Essen’s total aggregate liability for any and all damages, losses or liabilities arising hereunder or from the supply of products and/or services exceed the amounts actually received by Van Essen from Buyer with respect to such products and/or services giving rise to the liability. Buyer shall indemnify Van Essen for any liability arising from Buyer’s (including its employees’ and agents’) and any subsequent owner’s use of the products sold (directly or indirectly) by Van Essen.
Article 10: Confidentiality
10.1 Confidential Information means any and all information disclosed by Van Essen to Buyer or its representatives (“Receiving Party”), including information relating to the matters which are the subject of these Terms and Conditions, the existence and nature of these Terms and Conditions, and all other information regarding Van Essen’s past, present or future research, technology, know-how, ideas, concepts, designs, products, markets, computer programs, prototypes, processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, business plans and operations, technical information, drawings, specifications, and the like, except information which is: (a) at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, a part of the public domain through no act or omission by Receiving Party or its representatives; (b) lawfully in the possession of Receiving Party prior to disclosure by or on behalf of Van Essen as shown by Receiving Party’s written records; (c) lawfully disclosed to Receiving Party by a third-party which did not acquire the same under an obligation of confidentiality from or through Van Essen as shown by written records; or (d) independently developed by Receiving Party without use of Van Essen’s Confidential Information as shown by Receiving Party’s written records.
10.2 Receiving Party shall not, without the prior consent of Van Essen, disclose any of the Confidential Information to anyone for any reason at any time or use any of the Confidential Information for any purpose except as requested by Van Essen. If Receiving Party believes in good faith that it is required by the law of any relevant jurisdiction or pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or that of a competent regulatory authority to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it shall provide notice to Van Essen prior to making such disclosure so as to allow Van Essen time to undertake legal or other action to prevent such disclosure or otherwise obtain confidential treatment of such disclosure. In no event will Receiving Party disclose any of the Confidential Information that Receiving Party is not compelled to disclose by law, and Receiving Party will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any of the Confidential Information so disclosed.
10.3 Receiving Party shall limit dissemination of the Confidential Information to only those of Receiving Party having a “need to know”, and advise each such person who receives the Confidential Information that such information is confidential and require each such person (other than attorneys and other agents who are already under a professional duty of confidentiality) to sign and comply with a written agreement obligating it/he/she to observe all of Receiving Party’s obligations hereunder relating to confidentiality, non-disclosure and restrictions on use.
Article 11: Force Majeure
11.1 Van Essen shall not be liable for failure to perform or for delay in performance due to fire, flood, strike, or other labor difficulty, act of God, act of any governmental authority, riot, embargo, fuel or energy shortage, wrecks or delays in transportation, inability to obtain necessary labor, materials, or manufacturing facilities from usual sources, or due to any cause beyond Van Essen’s reasonable control. In the event of a delay in performance due to any such cause, the estimated date of delivery or time for completion of performance will be extended by a period of time reasonably necessary to overcome the effect of such delay. If Van Essen reasonably determines that any such delay in performance is likely to extend for a period of ninety (90) days or more, Van Essen shall have the right to cancel the applicable order upon notice to Buyer with no liability or further obligation to Buyer with respect to such order.
Article 12: Assignment & Subcontracting
12.1 Van Essen may at any time assign, transfer, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions. Buyer may not assign, transfer, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without the prior written consent of Van Essen.
Article 13: Severance
13.1 If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of these Terms and Conditions (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall not be affected.
Article 14: Waiver
14.1 A waiver of any right or remedy under these Terms and Conditions is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms and Conditions or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
Article 15: Applicable Law
15.1 These Terms and Conditions and any dispute or claim arising hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws. Each party hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Contract.
