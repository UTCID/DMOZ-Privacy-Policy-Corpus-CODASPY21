CSUSM Website Privacy Statement
Analytics and Cookies
Last Update: 10/1/2020
The CSUSM website uses third party tools such as Google Analytics and Crazy Egg to help analyse how visitors use the website. Both of these third party tools use
“cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard
internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. No personally identifiable information is collected about you unless you explicitly submit that information on the CSUSM website.
The anonymous information generated by Google Analytics and Crazy Egg cookies about
your use of the CSUSM website is transmitted to Google and Crazy Egg – not CSUSM. This information is then processed by CSUSM to compile statistical reports on website activity for the CSUSM site only. CSUSM is using these reports to evaluate aggregate visitor usage so that we can optimize
content and design, to better meet our visitors needs.
For more information on the use of data by third party tools, please visit the Google Analytics Privacy Policy and the Crazy Egg Privacy Policy. For questions regarding the CSUSM Website Privacy Statement, please contact web@csusm.edu.
In summary, your anonymity is safe. That is a CSUSM commitment to you as a valued visitor.
