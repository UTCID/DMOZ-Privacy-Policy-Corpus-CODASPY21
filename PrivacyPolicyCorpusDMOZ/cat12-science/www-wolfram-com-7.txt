LEGAL INFORMATION
Wolfram Research
Terms and Conditions of Use
User Agreement for Access to the Wolfram Research, Inc. World
Wide
Website
Wolfram Research, Inc., its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies
(collectively referred to as "WRI") require that any visitor
("User") to its World Wide Websites ("Site") adhere to the
following rules and regulations. By accessing any Site, User indicates User's
acceptance of and agreement to these terms and conditions, as amended from
time to time by WRI.
General Disclaimers
This Site, including all software, functions, materials, and information, and any
products or services made available through this Site, are provided "as is"
without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, unless otherwise
expressly stated herein. WRI disclaims all warranties express or implied,
including but not limited to warranties of quiet enjoyment and
non-infringement, as well as any implied warranties of merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose as to any computer programs, or the design
or informational content of the Site.
WRI does not warrant or make any representations regarding operation of
the Site. WRI does not warrant or make any representation regarding the
validity, accuracy, or reliability of the results of the use of the materials
on the Site or any other World Wide Web resource or site linked to this Site.
The materials on this Site may be out of date, and WRI makes no commitment
to update the materials on this Site.
WRI does not and cannot guarantee or warrant that the files available for
downloading from this Site, if any, will be free from infection, viruses,
worms, Trojan horses, or other code that manifests contaminating or
destructive properties. WRI does not warrant that the Site, software,
materials, products, or service will be uninterrupted or error free or that any
defects in the Site or any element thereof will be corrected. Applicable law
may not allow the disclaiming of implied warranties, so the above
disclaimer may not apply to individual Users as it relates to implied
warranties.
In no event shall WRI, its agents or affiliates, or any third parties
mentioned within the Site be liable for any damages whatsoever (including,
without limitation, incidental and consequential damages, lost profits, or
damages resulting from lost data or business interruption) resulting from or
arising out of the use or inability to use the Site and the materials contained
therein; all whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and
whether or not WRI is advised of the possibility of such damages.
Links
On the Site, WRI may include links to World Wide Websites or
resources for User convenience which are not created or controlled by WRI
("Linked sites"). WRI does not endorse or accept responsibility for any such
Linked site or resource User may access through WRI's Site. Linked sites are
wholly independent from WRI; as a result, WRI has no control over any
products, services, materials, or other information contained in or available
through these third-party websites. The quality and dependability of these
third-party websites may vary as they are updated or altered. Therefore,
access to any third-party websites through WRI's Site, regardless of
whether the third-party site is a Linked site or not, is entirely at the User's
own risk.
Indemnity
User agrees to indemnify and hold WRI, its agents,
affiliates, and assigns, harmless from and against any and all claims, losses,
liability, cost, or expense (including but not limited to reasonable attorney's
fees) relating to or arising from: 1) the violation or breach of these Terms
and Conditions; 2) violation or infringement of any third-party's rights, including
but not limited to copyrights and proprietary and privacy rights, resulting from
User's breach of these Terms and Conditions; or 3) any violation of applicable
federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance resulting from User's
breach of these Terms and Conditions.
Trademark Information
WRI's trademarks
may
be used or reproduced publicly only with permission from WRI. Fair
use of WRI's trademarks in advertising or promotion of WRI products requires
proper acknowledgment. All other brands are the property of their
respective owners.
Copyright and Ownership of Materials
Except where otherwise
noted, all materials, software, and information on the Site, as well as any
unique visual or functional elements of the Site, are copyrighted and are
protected by worldwide copyright laws and treaty provisions. They may not
be copied, reproduced, modified, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or
distributed in any way, in whole or in part, without WRI's prior written
permission.
Additional General Terms
Users are encouraged to peruse this Site, but must recognize that its
content is protected by international copyright, trademark and other
intellectual property laws and may not be mirrored, redistributed,
printed, publicly performed or displayed, reproduced in bulk, or archived
without advance written permission. Access to the Site may be blocked
without notice to subnets violating these Terms of Use or otherwise at the
discretion of WRI.
This Site was created, and is maintained,
in the State of Illinois, United States of America. WRI makes no claims that
the materials contained on the Site are appropriate or may be downloaded
outside of the United States. Access to the Site and the materials therein
(including software) may not be legal by certain persons or in certain
countries. If User accesses this Site from outside the United States, that
access is made at User's own risk. User is responsible for compliance with
the laws of User's jurisdiction.
Use of the Site, the Terms and Conditions of use, and all other aspects of
the operation and functionality of the Site shall be governed by and construed
under the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to its rules
regarding conflicts of laws. WRI and User hereby irrevocably consent to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in Illinois for any action, claim, or cause
arising out of or related to the use of the Site and any products or services
obtained through the Site. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is
found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of
such provision shall not impair the validity of the remaining Terms and
Conditions. No waiver of any provision of the Terms and Conditions shall be
deemed a further waiver of any other provision thereof.
