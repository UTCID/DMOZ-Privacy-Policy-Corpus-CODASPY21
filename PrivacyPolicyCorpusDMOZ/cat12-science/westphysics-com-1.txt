Testimonials
We have been using West Physics since 2013 for our ACR accreditation and state testing requirements with MRI, CT, X-ray, Ultrasound, and mammography and have been very pleased with their ability to support our needs.  The physicists are knowledgeable and always interact well with the staff at our imaging centers.  Their response time for retesting mammography units when a tube or detector has been replaced on short notice has always been prompt to minimize our downtime.  Our staff enjoys working with this vendor!

Thanks again for the GREAT service provided with our multi-state outpatient imaging centers. Your help in keeping up with the ever changing regulatory environment throughout the accreditation process has made my job so much easier. It is nice to be able to direct my efforts into other important company initiatives while West Physics handles the dirty work.  Your team has been helpful in providing information when needed and serve as a great asset in keeping our centers accredited and operating within the rules. Thank you for all your help.
— Dan Balentine

West Physics replaced our dedicated in-house staff physicist that retired in 2013 and has been able to meet our expectations for all of our equipment testing and RSO needs since taking over.
The West Physics staff has been very responsive and flexible with all my department staff when they need to speak promptly with a physicist regarding their equipment or radiation safety issues.
I would recommend them to any hospital that is looking for a full service medical and health physics provider.

"Thank-You. It has been a true pleasure working with your company and the physicists. The turnaround time for the reports is phenomenal. The physicists did an excellent job, so self-sufficient."

"Just want to let you know I got word today that we passed, maybe you already know. I would like to thank you and Zach and anyone else who helped this along. We have used West Physics for if not 12 years, then 10 and this is why. I feel you guys did an excellent job and would still recommend you to anyone, hands down. All your time and efforts need to be recognized, so again thank you."

"This was our first experience with the ACR accreditation process and we had already been notified that we had not passed our SPECT QC performance criteria using a different Physicist Group. Our MRI department recommended West Physics, and I couldn't have been happier.
From the moment I called, the Staff at West Physics were friendly and professional, and completely understood my concerns and time constraints that I was facing to re-submit my data. When the physicist came to my facility, he was friendly, thorough and professional, and his knowledge of my camera was unsurpassed. I was extremely pleased with West Physics, and I appreciate all their help with our facility passing the ACR! We will always be using West Physics for all of our ACR Accreditation needs in the future."

"I’ve known Geoff West personally for several years. His company provides a quality service at a fair price. If you are going to make the effort for ACR site accreditation, then physics support is a must. I highly recommend West Physics."

"West Physics Consulting has been providing our Physicist Services since January 2007. As an outpatient PET/CT Imaging Center we require standard services (quarterly audits) as well as assistance obtaining ACR accreditation. The services that they have provided for our facility are excellent; I appreciate their attention to detail as well as personal service. I fully trust the competence and expertise of West Physics. It has been my privilege to work with the staff of West Physics."

"Having to go through accreditation on 3 brand new modalities seemed to be a messy and stressful process. I was wrong! West Physics made the process so easy and manageable that I will never stress out about it again. It was so wonderful to be able to complete the surveys on a weekend with little downtime and to have such a highly qualified cross trained physicist to be able to handle not only CT and MRI, but PET as well. I have recommended West Physics to other centers we work with and know without a doubt that they are the gold standard in Physics Services and Testing."

“I've been throwing your name out there a lot lately. I've been dealing with quite a few physicists that have not done MR testing before. When a site calls for their yearly testing I usually just tell them to call you since we have a high level of confidence in your ability and your familiarity with our product. Keep up the good work!”
