Introduction to cookies
Cookies are small text files that are transferred to users’ computers, smartphones or tablets by means of a web browser. Cookies are transferred to the permanent memory of the device when the user visits the website, to allow the system to recognise the user during subsequent visits, improving the overall user experience.
Cookies may be temporary (session cookies), i.e. only used during the user’s visit to the website and eliminated when the browser is closed, or permanent, i.e. which remain in the permanent memory of the device even when the user exits the website and, therefore, until they are manually deleted by the user or automatically by the browser after a certain period of time.
Cookies can serve different purposes:
technical cookies make it possible to remember the user when browsing a website;
analytics cookies collect aggregated data on the parts of the website visited most frequently and monitor the promotional messages conveyed by the website, so as to to improving contents and facilitating consultation;
profiling cookies aim to create profiles relative to the user on the basis of the browsing experience, not only of an individual website but more generally on the internet; they are used to send advertising messages that are in line with the preferences expressed while browsing the internet.
The cookies installed by the website
The website uses some temporary technical cookies that allow the user to be remembered while browsing.
The website also uses (both temporary and permanent, first and third party) analytics cookies in order to collect aggregated information on the pages visited most frequently and monitor advertising: the information thus obtained is then used to improve the website contents and facilitate its use by users.
For third-party analytics cookies, tools have been adopted that reduce the power of the cookies to identify users and prevent third parties from cross-linking the information collected with other information already in its possession: there is therefore no need to obtain user consent upon installation.
