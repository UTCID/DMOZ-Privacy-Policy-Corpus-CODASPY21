Forecasting and Economic Policy Department
bookmark_border
Departmental Focus
The Forecasting and Economic Policy Department uses modern macroeconomic methods to analyze economic policy issues. Economic forecasting is a key component of the department’s work, as evidenced by its flagship publications—the monthly DIW Economic Barometer (DIW Konjunkturbarometer) and the quarterly DIW Economic Outlook (Grundlinien der Wirtschaftsentwicklung)—as well its participation in the Joint Economic Forecast (Gemeinschaftsdiagnose). Researchers contribute to economic policy advice and deliver statements on topical issues based on their research findings. Department members actively participate in the public discourse and maintain strong presences in the media.
