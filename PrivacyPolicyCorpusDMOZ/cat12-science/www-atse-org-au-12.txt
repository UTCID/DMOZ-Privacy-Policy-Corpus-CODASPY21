Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels for its domestic energy needs.
In 2013, about 34 per cent of total domestic energy was sourced from coal, 39 per cent from petroleum products, 23 per cent from natural gas and 4 per cent from renewables.
We have long advocated for technology-neutral policies that can address the electricity trilemma – providing reliable and secure electricity, at an affordable cost to the consumer, while reducing and eventually eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.
Featured publication
