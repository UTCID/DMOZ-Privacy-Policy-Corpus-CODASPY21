RoHS stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances. The original RoHS Directive, 2002/95/EC, was introduced in the European Union in 2002 and restricts the use of six hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products. All applicable products in the EU market since July 1, 2006 must pass RoHS compliance.
Directive 2011/65/EU went into effect on January 2, 2013 and is known as RoHS 2. RoHS 2 includes a CE-marking directive, with RoHS compliance now being required for CE marking of products. RoHS 2 also added Categories 8 and 9 (medical devices and monitoring and control instruments) and has additional compliance record keeping requirements. Directive 2015/863 currently in effect is known as RoHS 3. RoHS 3 adds four additional restricted substances (phthalates) to the list of six. EU RoHS specifies maximum levels for the following 10 restricted substances. The first six applied to the original RoHS while the last four were added under Directive 2015/863 which went into effect July 22, 2019.
Cadmium (Cd): < 100 ppmLead (Pb): < 1000 ppmMercury (Hg): < 1000 ppmHexavalent Chromium: (Cr VI) < 1000 ppmPolybrominated Biphenyls (PBB): < 1000 ppmPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE): < 1000 ppmBis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP): < 1000 ppmBenzyl butyl phthalate (BBP): < 1000 ppmDibutyl phthalate (DBP): < 1000 ppmDiisobutyl phthalate (DIBP): < 1000 ppm
