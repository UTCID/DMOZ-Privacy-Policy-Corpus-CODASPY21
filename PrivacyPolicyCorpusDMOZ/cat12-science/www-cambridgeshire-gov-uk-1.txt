Privacy and data protection
As a County Council we provide a large range of different services, as explained throughout our website, and virtually all of these rely on us collecting and using information about individuals.
Everything we do with that information, from how we collect it to how long we keep it for, has to comply with Data Protection legislation. This has been the case for many years, but you will probably be aware that this legislation has now been updated.
This section of our website provides information on our data protection practices.
It brings together our Privacy notices, which are used to inform you of details such as what information we collect, why we collect it, what we use it for, who we share it with, and what rights you have about the information we hold about you.
We have a main council-wide privacy notice that covers our information use in broad terms and then a developing group of service-specific notices that go into more detail.
These notices can be read alongside the details provided when we collect information from you, such as a statement on a form, a service information leaflet or discussed with you in person by one of our staff members.
An Easy Read version of our privacy notice can be found below.
