ASDWA’s News Feeds and Social Media
Twitter and Social Media
ASDWA shares all of our published content, in real-time, through the following social media:
Twitter: @ASDWAorg
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ASDWAorg/
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCesO_7DGNrTrMahHdBds00Q
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds offer a unique alternative for individuals looking to stay in-the-know, without the Inbox clutter that is traditionally associated with email-based subscriptions.  If you find yourself growing increasingly frustrated with every new web subscription adding more email to your Inbox, potentially burying important communications, then RSS was designed for you…and worth a few minutes of your time to learn how to take advantage of it.
Put simply, RSS feeds capture information on web pages and deliver it to “RSS readers” or “RSS aggregators”, allowing an individual to consume information from a variety of sources without the need to visit multiple websites. RSS readers collect information [articles, updated information, etc] from any web-syndicated feed you’re subscribed to; giving you a centralized location with all of your updates.  Now, you can read the news when you have time – maybe after you’ve dealt with all of those important communications in your Inbox.
ASDWA maintains the following RSS Feeds:
National Drinking Water Headlines – https://www.asdwa.org/category/thesourcenews/feed/
AWOP – https://www.asdwa.org/category/awop/feed/

Looking for a good reader? Feedly is an example of a web-based RSS reader.  For mobile users, Flipboard is a popular RSS option – highly recommended! Some email clients have RSS readers built-in, like MS Outlook, to keep your feed updates and inbox communications separate, but accessible via a common interface.  You may also find RSS readers available as add-ons, or built-in, modern web-browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer v.9+.
Want to learn more?  Wordpress has assembled an excellent support article on RSS: http://en.support.wordpress.com/feeds/.  Alternatively, you might want to read this Wikipedia entry for a more technical look at RSS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
