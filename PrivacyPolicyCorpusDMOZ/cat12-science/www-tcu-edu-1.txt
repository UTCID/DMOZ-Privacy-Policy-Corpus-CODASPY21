MISSING STUDENT NOTIFICATION (as listed on the TCU Police Department website)
Missing Student Notification PolicyIf anyone has reason to believe that a student who resides in on-campus housing is
missing, he or she should immediately notify the TCU Police Department at 817- 257-7777.

After investigating the missing person report, should the department determine that
the student is missing and has been missing for more than 24 hours, TCU Police Department
will notify the Fort Worth Police Department and also the student’s emergency contact
no later than 24 hours after the student is determined to be missing. If the missing
student is under the age of 18 and is not an emancipated individual, the University
will notify the student’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) within 24 hours after the
TCU Police Department has determined that the student is missing. If a missing student
is over 18 and an emergency contact has not been given to TCU, the Fort Worth PD (or
other appropriate law enforcement agency) and the student’s parents will be notified.In addition to registering an emergency contact, students residing in on campus housing
have the option to identify, confidentially, an individual to be contacted by the
University in the event the student is determined to be missing for more than 24 hours.
If a student has identified such an individual, the University will notify that individual
no later than 24 hours after the student is determined to be missing.
