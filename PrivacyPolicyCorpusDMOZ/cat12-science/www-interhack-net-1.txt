The Internet Privacy Project is an ongoing study of how systems
on the Internet affect the privacy of the Internet population.
From this page, we'll provide pointers to papers and advisories
we release, as well as some of the tools that we develop in the
process of our studies.
Publications
The site's publications index includes all
of these along with brief summaries, so we're listing only by
title here.

Code
CookiePokey
CookiePokey is a
Java program that
tests a site's compliance to the HTTP header case insensitivity
requirement as spelled out in section 4.2 of the HTTP protocol
specification
(RFC 2616).
It's a JAR (Java ARchive) that includes the executable (class
file) and source code.
To use it, unwind the archive with the JAR program and then run
the class file.
Then you'll see something like the following.
Notice that we're always sending a cookie whose value is
id=OPT_OUT.
Whether we send the header as
Cookie, cookie, COOKIE,
or CoOkIe is irrelevant.
RFC 2616 very clearly
states that HTTP headers are case insensitive.
Observe that
when we send the OPT_OUT cookie with the header
capitalized as Cookie, the server does not send
back a cookie.
But if we use any other combination of upper or
lower case, we get a new cookie; we're opted back in.
We've highlighted the cookie headers on this page so you know
what to look for when you run the program for yourself.

Contributors
This is actually something of a "meta-project", one that
encompasses several different investigations.
But we generally
work pretty closely together on all of these, so in alphabetical
order, we're:
