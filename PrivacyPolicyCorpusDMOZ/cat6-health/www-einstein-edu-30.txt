Einstein Fracture Care Clinic
Rely on Rapid Fracture Care
If you think you’ve broken a bone or have been told
by your primary care or emergency physician that
you have a fracture and need follow-up care, turn to
Einstein’s new Fracture Care Clinic. We provide easy
access to rapid care for adults and older teenagers (16+)
with acute injuries and make referrals easier for primary
care physicians and emergency rooms.
Run by an orthopedic physician assistant, and
supervised by an attending physician, the Fracture
Clinic is open Monday through Friday, from 8 am
to 4 pm. We have immediate same-day access;
please call for an appointment. Whether you walk
in with a suspected fracture or your physician calls
from the office or ER, you’ll be seen for a same- or
next-day appointment. This is important because
rapid treatment of fractures is key to proper healing.
Count on Comprehensive
Assessment and Care
At the Fracture Care Clinic, patients will receive:
An examination
X-rays (available on-site with insurance
company approval)
Casts, splints, slings and/or boots, as needed
Scheduling for surgery,* if needed
Scheduling for physical or occupational therapy,
if needed
Most people can receive continuing fracture care,
including check-ups during and following treatment,
right in our clinic. If you need surgery or require post treatment
physical or occupational therapy, we have
schedulers on-site who can help coordinate your care.
*Surgeries are not performed at the Fracture Care Clinic.
