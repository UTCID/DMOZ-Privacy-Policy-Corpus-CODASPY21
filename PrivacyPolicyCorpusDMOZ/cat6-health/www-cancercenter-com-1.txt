Disclaimers
THE SERVICES AND CTCA CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES OR CTCA CONTENT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY CTCA CONTENT.
Indemnity
You will indemnify and hold harmless CTCA and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, licensors, and contractors from and against any claims, suits, actions, demands, disputes, allegations, or investigations brought by any third party, governmental authority, or industry body, and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (1) your access to or use of the Services, (2) Your Content, (3) your breach or alleged breach of any warranties made by you hereunder or your violation of any other provision of these Terms, or (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.

Limitation of liability
NEITHER CTCA NOR ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF THEIR SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT CTCA HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
IN NO EVENT WILL CTCA’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO CTCA FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO CTCA, AS APPLICABLE.
THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN CTCA AND YOU.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Dispute resolution (agreement to arbitrate)
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND CTCA ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND THE SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTES”) WILL, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BE GOVERNED BY THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURE OUTLINED BELOW.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND CTCA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” CLAUSE. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE ANY PARTY FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
SCOPE.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL COURT OR AGENCY, SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION, APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR FORMATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS VOID OR VOIDABLE.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING ALL THRESHOLD ARBITRABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATING TO WHETHER THE TERMS ARE UNCONSCIONABLE OR ILLUSORY AND ANY DEFENSE TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WAIVER, DELAY, LACHES OR ESTOPPEL.
GOVERNING LAW. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TERMS AND THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.
INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS WITHOUT NEEDING A FORMAL LEGAL CASE. BEFORE FILING A CLAIM AGAINST CTCA, YOU AGREE TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY BY CONTACTING US USING THE CONTACT INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE “HOW TO CONTACT US” SECTION BELOW. WE'LL TRY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY BY CONTACTING YOU THROUGH EMAIL. IF A DISPUTE IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS AFTER SUBMISSION, YOU OR CTCA MAY BRING A FORMAL PROCEEDING.
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE. YOU AND CTCA AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH UNDER EXCEPTIONS TO AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BELOW.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) WILL ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE HELD IN BOCA RATON, FLORIDA.
IF THIS LOCATION IS NOT CONVENIENT FOR YOU, CTCA WILL WORK WITH YOU TO DETERMINE A MUTUALLY CONVENIENT LOCATION. DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING THE LOCATION IN WHICH ARBITRATION HEARINGS WILL BE HELD SHALL BE SETTLED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
ARBITRATION FEES. IF YOU INITIATE ARBITRATION, YOUR ARBITRATION FEES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FILING FEE SET FORTH IN AAA’S CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES. REGARDLESS OF WHO INITIATES ARBITRATION, CTCA WILL PAY THE CUSTOMER’S SHARE OF ARBITRATION FEES (NOT INCLUDING THE CUSTOMER’S ATTORNEYS’ FEES) UP TO A MAXIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($2,500). IF THE ARBITRATOR RULES AGAINST CTCA, IN ADDITION TO ACCEPTING WHATEVER RESPONSIBILITY IS ORDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR, CTCA WILL REIMBURSE THE CUSTOMER’S REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000), REGARDLESS OF WHO INITIATED THE ARBITRATION, UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR FINDS SOME OR ALL OF YOUR CLAIMS TO BE FRIVOLOUS OR TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH. IN ADDITION, IF THE ARBITRATOR RULES IN OUR FAVOR, WE WILL NOT SEEK REIMBURSEMENT OF CTCA’S ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS, REGARDLESS OF WHO INITIATED THE ARBITRATION, UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR FINDS SOME OR ALL OF THE YOUR CLAIMS TO BE FRIVOLOUS OR TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BAD FAITH.
EXCEPTIONS TO AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. EITHER YOU OR CTCA MAY ASSERT CLAIMS, IF THEY QUALIFY, IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. EITHER PARTY MAY BRING A LAWSUIT SOLELY FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ABUSE OF THE SERVICES OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (FOR EXAMPLE, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, COPYRIGHT OR PATENT RIGHTS) WITHOUT FIRST ENGAGING IN ARBITRATION OR THE INFORMAL DISPUTE-RESOLUTION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
NO CLASS ACTIONS. YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH CTCA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER OUR AGREEMENT.
JUDICIAL FORUM FOR DISPUTES. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN THE EVENT THAT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO YOU OR YOUR CLAIM, YOU AND CTCA AGREE THAT ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS) WILL BE BROUGHT IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF NEW YORK COUNTY (NY). BOTH YOU AND CTCA CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. WE BOTH AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
LIMITATION ON CLAIMS. REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE, OR ELSE THAT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION WILL BE BARRED FOREVER.
SEVERABILITY.
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS HELD INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ALL OTHER TERMS WITHIN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
Third party links and services
We provide links to third party websites operated by organizations not affiliated with CTCA. CTCA does not review or endorse, and is not responsible for, the practices of these organizations. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy statements of each and every website that you visit.
General terms
Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between CTCA and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between CTCA and you regarding the Services and CTCA Content.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without CTCA’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by CTCA under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (1) via email or (2) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
CTCA’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of CTCA. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
Additional terms may apply
Additional terms may apply to certain Services, and we will notify you of any additional terms prior to your use of such Services. In the event that there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms, the additional terms will control.
Changes to these terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms. When we update these Terms, we will post a new Effective Date at the top. If we make material changes that would impact your use of the Services, we will endeavor to notify you of the changes prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice directly on the Services, by sending an email notification (if you have provided your email address to us), or by any other reasonable method. Continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance to such modifications.
