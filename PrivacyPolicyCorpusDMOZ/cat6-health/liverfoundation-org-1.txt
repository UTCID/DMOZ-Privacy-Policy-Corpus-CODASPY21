Policies
As an organization that strives everyday to exceed the standards set by the National Health Council and monitoring agencies, we are proud that donor contributions are put to the best possible use. The American Liver Foundation’s Diversity Policy, Standards of Conduct Policy, Corporate Relations Policy, Gift Acceptance Policy, Privacy Policy and Whistleblower Policy guide the conduct of our staff and volunteers to ensure that we continue to meet industry standards.
Corporate Relations Policy
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the corporate relationships entered into by the American Liver Foundation (ALF) are conducted in a manner consistent with its mission, principles, public positions, policies and standards. For purposes of this policy, the terms “corporate” or “corporation” shall also include any other kind of organizational entity, such as but not limited to partnerships, or foundations.

Diversity Policy
Liver disease does not discriminate.
And yet…
Hepatitis C (HCV) is more prevalent in African Americans than in any other racial group in the U.S. and African Americans are more likely to be deemed ineligible for HCV treatment than non-African Americans.1
African and Hispanic Americans are the two groups of people who have the largest increase in incidence of liver cancer and the lowest rates of curative treatment.2
African and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be uninsured than white Americans.3, 4
This is not acceptable.
We at the American Liver Foundation (ALF) are devastated by recent events and stand firmly against racism and inequality in all forms. We pledge to expand our offerings in marginalized communities, and to continue to treat everyone with the dignity, kindness and compassion that is their birthright.
ALF’s vision is a world without liver disease. Until that day comes, we will continue to fight for equal access to health care and better outcomes for all people impacted by liver disease.
