Shoulder conditions we treat
Many conditions can cause shoulder pain. And we deliver exceptional care for each one, including:
Arthritis

Connective tissue problems, including impingement syndrome
Orthopaedic trauma, such as broken bones (fractures)
Rotator cuff conditions, including bursitis, which happens when connective tissue in the shoulder becomes swollen
Shoulder dislocation
Treatments for shoulder pain
We offer a broad range of care options, including surgical and nonsurgical treatments. The treatments that are most effective for you depend on the diagnosis. We explain all of your options and together, make a plan to help you get relief.
Your care may include:
Bracing: Wearing a device (brace) limits movement so you can rest your shoulder, reducing the swelling and promoting healing.
Medication: Medications may relieve pain and reduce inflammation. For some people, an over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen provides relief. If the pain is severe, we may recommend prescription medication.
Injections: Injecting medications directly into the injured area may bring relief if other medications fail to stop the pain. Find out more about injections.
Physical therapy: We guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your shoulder. We also show you how to gently stretch the area to relieve stiffness. Learn more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
Surgery: If other treatments are not successful, surgery may be the most effective solution. Your treatment may include repairing torn or damaged tissue. If the problem is arthritis, you may need shoulder replacement surgery. Read more about orthopaedic surgery.
