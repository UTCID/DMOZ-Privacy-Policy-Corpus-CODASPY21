Protecting your privacy
We will do everything possible to ensure that your privacy and integrity is protected at all times.
Firstly, we will not, under any circumstances whatsoever, give out or sell your information (including name and email address) to anyone. We will also never send you an email unless it is important and directly related to The McGuire Programme or you have opted in to our Newsletter.
We strictly control who accesses website data and no-one generally will have access to your form/application submissions except Dave McGuire and/or your local Regional Director.
From time to time, a web developer will have to access the code in order to update the system, perform routine maintenance, and possibly fix bugs. However, all your data will still remain 100% confidential.
All our coaching staff are CRB checked and for anyone under 18 who wishes to participate in our programme, full parental consent will be needed at every stage.
If you have any questions or concerns with any of the above, please contact us ASAP and we will be happy to clarify.
