MDA Financial Accountability
Muscular Dystrophy Australia receives donations and grants from both the community and governing bodies. We conduct only ethical fundraising campaigns which maximize our dollar to cause policy. We do not run expensive campaigns or fundraising initiatives that may take away vital funds for programs and services.
MDA is proud of its proven track record in fundraising, welcoming a comprehensive fundraising audit which proves we satisfy all legislative requirements. We are fully compliant with fundraising license requirements in all states and territories we campaign in.
MDA maintains the highest accounting standards utilizing the latest software available, with all MDA accounts independently audited annually by Pitcher Partners. All these accounts are unqualified.
We remain loyal to the task at hand – of raising urgent funds to run vital services and programs for the MD community, as well as supporting the National Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre. We are passionate about ensuring that any donation made is handled with professionalism and financial integrity.
