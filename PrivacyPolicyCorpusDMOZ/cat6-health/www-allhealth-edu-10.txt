Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm
Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a ballooning, weakened area in the upper portion of the aorta. It may also be called thoracic aneurysm and aortic dissection (TAAD) because an aneurysm can lead to a tear in the artery wall and can cause fatal bleeding. Slow-growing and small thoracic aortic aneurysms may not ever rupture, but fast-growing, large ones may.
Cardiovascular surgeons at Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cardiovascular Institute are leaders in using advanced diagnostic technology and therapeutic intervention to diagnose and treat thoracic aortic aneurysms and lower your risk for blood clots.
