Millions of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have been at work spreading the Zika virus in South and Central America. This is not the first time a mosquito-borne virus has broken loose in the Americas. Mosquitoes and viruses have shaped the history of the Western hemisphere in surprising ways for centuries; the United States might not be an independent country without them.
Before 1492, Aedes aegypti did not live in the Americas. It came from West Africa, probably on ships of the transatlantic slave trade. The mosquito gradually colonized parts of the Americas and served as the primary carrier for yellow fever and dengue, viruses that are cousins of Zika.
Aedes aegypti is a fussy mosquito with a strong preference for human blood, which makes it an efficient spreader of human disease. It lays eggs in artificial water containers such as pots, cans, barrels, wells, or cisterns. This preference for human activities distinguishes it from the thousands of other mosquito species.
Together these mosquitoes and their fevers decided the fate of empires. In 1697 the kingdom of Scotland attempted to establish a trading colony on the Caribbean shore of Panama. Within two years, however, some 70 percent of the Scots were dead of “fever.” In 1707 Scotland accepted union with England partly to pay debts incurred by the disaster.

In 1763, France had just lost Canada in war to Britain and hoped to regain its position in the Americas with a new colony in what is now French Guiana. Some 11,000 hopeful souls were recruited from France and elsewhere in Europe. Like the hapless Scots, their immune systems had no previous experience of yellow fever or dengue (and in most cases, none of malaria, either). Within 18 months, 85 to 90 percent of them had died from disease.
By the end of the 18th century, mosquitoes were not just intervening in imperial schemes, they were helping the Americas win their liberty. Yellow fever and malaria ravaged European armies sent to prevent revolution in what is now Haiti and Venezuela, leading to the creation of independent countries.
Even the U.S. owes its independence in part to mosquitoes and malaria. In 1780, the southern colonies, which had widespread malaria, became a decisive theater in the American Revolution. British troops had almost no experience with malaria, and thus no resistance to it. American militiamen, and much of the Continental Army, had grown up in the South and faced malaria every summer. So in the summer of 1780, the British Army hosted its own malaria epidemic, which was particularly intense in the South Carolina low country. At times, half the British Army was too sick to move.
In 1781, the British commander in the South, Lord Cornwallis, decided to move his army north, into the hills of Virginia, to avoid “the fatal sickness which so nearly ruined the army” the summer before. His superiors, however, ordered him to move to the tidewater, and so in June, Cornwallis dug in at Yorktown.
In the warm months, mosquitoes (including a malaria vector species called Anopheles quadrimaculatus) started to bite, and by late summer of 1781, malaria had taken hold of his army once again. Some 51 percent of his men were too sick  to conduct the counter-siege operations that Cornwallis knew were required. American and French forces penned the troops in until Cornwallis surrendered in October, which in effect decided the outcome of the American Revolution.
Mosquitoes only lost their political importance after medical researchers realized that they were spreading the fevers. The first to publish the idea that Aedes aegypti could carry yellow fever was a Cuban doctor, Carlos Finlay. U.S. military doctors led by Walter Reed confirmed Finlay’s hypothesis. Armed with this knowledge, when the U.S. Army occupied Cuba (after 1898) and Panama (after 1903) they made life miserable for Aedes aegypti — covering up water containers and putting a drop of kerosene into those without covers. Within a couple of years, mosquito control had banished yellow fever from Cuba and Panama’s Canal Zone.
Over the next 70 years or so, mosquito control acquired ever more weapons. Insecticides, such as DDT — brought to bear in the 1940s — proved deadly to all mosquitoes (and other creatures).
But Aedes aegypti control proved too successful for its own good. Once the mosquito populations had fallen drastically, and the risk of yellow fever and dengue diminished, budgets were redirected away from mosquito control all over the Americas.
Had the Zika virus come to the Americas in the 1930s or 1950s, its prospects would have been poor — Aedes aegypti was under control. But since the 1980s Aedes aegypti has made a dramatic comeback in the Americas. While the main reason is the lapse in mosquito control, the warming climate has extended the mosquito’s range. Today, Zika’s chances of spreading widely among human populations via Aedes aegypti are far greater. And it will have help from Aedes albopictus, another mosquito capable of transmitting the virus, which arrived from East Asia in the 1980s.
Combating Zika will require mosquito control, and the political difficulty that arouses shows a defiant aspect of the American character to which mosquitoes and malaria gave free rein. Malaria may have helped Americans win the revolution in 1780-81, but their descendants cherish their liberty and say, in effect, "don't tread on me" when told to cover water containers. Any attempt to spray pesticides in our democracy quickly excites opposition. Eventually, perhaps, a vaccine will sideline Zika, but until then these coming summers give the virus a chance to run amok — and give mosquitoes another chance to make history.
