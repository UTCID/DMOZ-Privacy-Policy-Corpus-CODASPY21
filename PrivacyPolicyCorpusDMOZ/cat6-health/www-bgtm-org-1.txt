The CSC is comprised of nonprofit agencies
that all have a successful history of serving the needs of children and
families in the area. In the CSC, members work together to promote the delivery
of social and behavioral healthcare services for Missouri's children and
families through advocacy, collaboration, and communication. CSC members work
collaboratively toward the following purposes:
Providing a
unified voice regarding services, funding and advocacy for Missouri's children
and their families;
Acting as a
forum for identifying needs and gaps in the continuum of care for Missouri's
children and their families;
Serving as a
vehicle for discussion and sharing of knowledge, services and best practices;
Encouraging
program and funding collaborations and referrals; and
Mobilizing
grassroots support as appropriate.

Children's Trust Fund
www.ctf4kids.org
Children's Trust Fund (CTF) is Missouri's foundation for child abuse prevention. CTF was created by the Missouri General Assembly in 1983 as a 501c(3) non-profit organization whose purpose is to prevent and/or alleviate child abuse and neglect. CTF does not receive any general revenue or funding from the state to support its prevention activities. Funding is obtained from dedicated fees on marriage licenses and vital records, volunteer contributions designated on Missouri state income tax returns, sales of the specialty CTF license plate, general donations, interest income from the fund, and other grants.
Kids Count Data Book
www.kidscount.org
The 30th edition of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT® Data Book begins by exploring how America’s child population — and the American childhood experience — has changed since 1990. And there’s some good news to share: Of the 16 areas of child well-being tracked across four domains — health, education, family and community and economic well-being — 11 have improved since the Foundation published its first Data Book 30 editions ago. The rest of the 2019 Data Book — including the latest national trends and state rankings — rely on a shorter review window: 2010 to 2017. The data reveal, in the United States today, more parents are financially stable and living without burdensome housing costs. More teens are graduating from high school and delaying parenthood. And access to children’s health insurance has increased compared to just seven years ago.
Kidzrock
www.kidzrockband.com
Kidzrock is a music program that teaches children as young as 4 how to play an instrument in the setting of a real rock band. Band members rotate on drums, electric guitar, and keyboard as they prepare to sing and play in a rock concert. Each band sings and performs songs featured on the Kidzrock CD. The songs are composed specifically for the program and use simple music patterns allowing this age group immediate access to musical performance.
Children learn how to read color-coded standard music notation from the Kidzrock Songbook while playing on modified instruments for smaller sized hands. The program creates a unique experience by combining instruments, theory, singing, ensemble performance and rock ‘n’ roll fantasy all rolled into one. All instruments are provided by Kidzrock and there are no practice expectations outside of the class.
Missouri Department of Social Services Children's Division
www.dss.mo.gov
This site provides information on services for children, youth and families such as becoming a foster parent, adoption and child care. Contact information for reporting suspected child abuse and neglect also can be found on this site.
The Productive Living Board
www.plboard.org
PLB is a public taxing entity, commonly known as a “Senate Bill 40 Board,” that enters into funding contracts with agencies that serve individuals with developmental disabilities in St. Louis County. While adhering to the state statute that makes our work possible, PLB leverages its resources to understand and meet the changing local community needs.
