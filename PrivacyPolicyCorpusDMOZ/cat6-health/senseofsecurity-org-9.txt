In Loving Memory of Vicki TosherIt is with deep sadness that Sense of Security learned of Vicki Tosher's passing on July 11, 2020.
Vicki co-founded Sense of Security with her friend Angela Ricker in 2000 after helping her dear friend Donna Rogers cope with a diagnosis of breast cancer. This was only one of many breast-cancer related leadership positions Vicki held over the years - all while fighting breast cancer herself.
Vicki's amazing energy, dedication, compassion, generosity and loving spirit improved the lives and brightened the spirits of those around her. Her laugh was infectious, her creativity boundless, and her love of friends and family knew no bounds. Perry and Vicki were welcome guests at our events and we are sure at other parties around town.
As information is available related to Vicki's funeral services, we will share them as appropriate in these times of COVID restrictions.
