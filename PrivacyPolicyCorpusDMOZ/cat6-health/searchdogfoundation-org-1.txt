IMPORTANT NOTICE In accordance with federal guidelines related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all Search Dog Foundation staff who are non-essential to our canine care and campus operations will be working remotely.
Rest assured that our canines in training who live on campus are being well cared for by our Canine Care team and are continuing to get their daily exercise in. A core group of our dedicated Canine Care staff are staying on campus and are taking the dogs on daily hikes, completing core strength workout sessions in our canine gym, and having plenty of free play time in the yards. These team members are taking every precaution with regard to extra sanitization measures and physically distancing themselves from each other during this time while still ensuring our canines get the mental and physical stimulation, love and care they deserve.
We are so grateful to all the first responders, health care and other industry workers who are on the front lines, helping to care for others. Please take care of each other – we thank you all for your support during this time, we so appreciate all of you being Part of the Search!
