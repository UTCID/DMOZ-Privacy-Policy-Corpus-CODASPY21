Legacy of Hope members make the support needs of cancer patients, caregivers, and their loved ones a priority by generously and thoughtfully planning and declaring their intent to include Cancer Hope Network in their estate plans.
Planned Giving provides long-term funding and support for Cancer Hope Network’s important work in the oncology community. This type of giving may also provide financial benefits for the donor and/or the donor’s family.
We invite you to become a member of our Legacy of Hope Leadership Circle by including Cancer Hope Network in your estate plans. Examples of planned giving vehicles include:
Wills & Bequests- Gifts directed through a will with a predetermined dollar amount or % of total value of estate designated to Cancer Hope Network.
Charitable Gift Annuities or Remainder Trusts- Cancer Hope Network named as beneficiary; this can be designated in % amount.
Life Insurance- Designation of Cancer Hope Network as a primary or secondary beneficiary; allocated in % amount
IRA/Retirement Plan Beneficiary Designation- Cancer Hope Network designated as the beneficiary of any unused plan assets.
Please contact your financial advisor for more information on how to include Cancer Hope Network in your estate plan.
