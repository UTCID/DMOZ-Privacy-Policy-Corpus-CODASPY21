Privacy Policy
Updated on May 25, 2018
The American College of Surgeons, the ACS Foundation, the
ACS Insurance Trust, the ACS Political Action Committee (collectively "ACS,"
"we," or "us") knows that you care how your information is
used and shared. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes our
policies with respect to information that ACS collects through the website at
www.facs.org ("Website") and in connection with ACS membership,
conferences, and other products or services.
Changes in this Policy
ACS may amend this Policy at any time without notice.
Changes to this Policy may affect our use of personally identifiable
information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the
changes. Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our
Policy.
ACS uses various technologies to protect the
confidentiality, security, and integrity of information volunteered or
collected from users of the Website. We do not require anyone to divulge any
personally identifiable information to use the Website. ACS on occasion
requires a user to register, when for example applying for membership or
purchasing products or services. ACS will not collect personal information
about you unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.
I. Information ACS Collects
The information we collect generally includes: (1)
personal information you supply and (2) tracking information collected as you
navigate through the Website.
Information Collected
from You
We may collect and store personally identifiable information
that you provide to us. The personally identifiable information we request from
you may include your: (i) country of residence; (ii) first, middle, and last
name; (iii) age and date of birth; (iv) highest level of education attained;
(v) job title; (vi) home or office phone and fax numbers; (vii) employer's name
and address; (viii) home or office address; (ix) home or office e-mail address;
(x) ACS member identification number, user ID, and password; and (xi) credit
card information (only if purchases are made) (collectively “Personal Data”).
Information Collected through
Technology
Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, ACS
collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For
example, your IP address provides ACS with non-personally identifiable
information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet
service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit ACS to
identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in
Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track
certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that
resides on your computer. ACS uses cookies to make the Website more interesting
and useful (for example, cookies let us know which of our sites you have been
visiting and which you have not).
Information Is Not
Collected Online from Children Under 13
ACS does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable
information online from children under the age of 13.
II. How ACS Uses that Information
ACS uses your personally identifiable information for the
purposes for which it was submitted. For example, ACS uses the information
collected to enable a user to: (i) fulfill membership benefits (ii) purchase
ACS educational materials for purposes of obtaining Continuing Medical
Education ("CME") credit, (iii) pay membership dues, (iv) make
Political Action Committee and charitable contributions, (v) to purchase other
ACS products, (vi) to receive ACS newsletters and product and/or service
announcements, (vii) to participate in ACS sponsored meetings, programs, and
activities; and (viii) such other use related to ACS’s mission. We do not
undertake to maintain any information about you for a duration greater than
necessary to provide services to you or as provided by law, rule or regulation.
In the event that you choose to participate in the ACS
directory you acknowledge that your name, location, contact information(phone
number, e-mail address), specialty, subspecialty, education and training, areas
of clinical concentration, hospital appointments, academic appointments,
society memberships, date of birth, and gender) will be available to search,
access and view by the general public. You may elect to not participate in the
directory by updating your profile.
ACS may use information about use of the Website and
aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to
improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to
you and for its other business purposes.
III. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable
Information
ACS uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure server
encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. ACS also
employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block
unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems. However, while we employ
reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be
aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and
we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
IV. Information Sharing with Third Parties
Limited personally identifiable information we request
from you (namely, your name and home or office address) is occasionally sold to
third parties, generally for educational programs. For example, the list of
registrants to a Clinical Congress may be sold to exhibitors to the Clinical
Congress. Moreover, personally identifiable information is occasionally shared
with third parties so that these parties can send you promotional material
about goods and services offered by the ACS or the third parties.
We may also share your personal information with our
authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These
services may include providing customer service, performing business and sales
analysis, and supporting our Website functionality, other features offered
through our Website. These service providers may have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions but are not authorized to share
or use such information for any other purposes.
We may also provide your information to third parties to
accomplish the purpose for which the information was submitted, such as
providing your personally identifiable information to credit card processors to
process a purchase.
We may also transfer user or customer information,
including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate
transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.
We may disclose specific information in response to a
valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required
by law, to enforce our Website policies, or to protect our or others' rights,
property, or safety. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement   illegal
uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may
also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or
investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for
marketing or commercial purposes.
V. Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data
ACS enables users of its Website and interactive
educational products to update contact information and to opt out of the
collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications
or services by e-mail, telephone, or regular mail. Please use the contact

benefits with you. We will give you your Personal Data in a structured,
