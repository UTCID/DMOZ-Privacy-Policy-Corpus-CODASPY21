Ways to Help
Do You Know Where to Go?
First, don’t panic. Your symptoms could be allergies, common cold, or flu — but it’s best to be sure. You have a few different options for receiving care.
Primary Care
If you are experiencing symptoms or believe you may be at risk for COVID-19, please call your doctor’s office or our 24/7 Nurse line first before going to the emergency department or to your physician’s office.
For answers on Coronavirus, the flu, or any health-related questions, call your doctor.
Call our 24/7 Nurse Line for help in understanding your condition. In the Pittsburgh or Erie area call (412) NURSE-4-U (412) 687-7348.
If you don’t have a doctor, find a doctor now, call (412) DOCTORS (412) 362-8677 or (814) SAMEDAY (814) 762-3329.
If you are in a medical emergency, call 911 immediately. It is recommended to call the ER or the urgent care facility so they can prepare for your arrival.
Video Visit
Plan ahead—make sure you are all set to have a video visit with a medical professional now, so you don’t have to leave the house if you do get sick.
This is a great way to avoid leaving home when you are ill and still receive medical assistance. Just log in and select Video Visit.
Video visits are also available 24/7 with MyChart.
Videos Visits are interactive, real-time video appointments with an AHN provider. They are available exclusively through your MyChart account. All you need is a mobile, tablet, or desktop device with a camera, an Internet connection, and a quiet, private place where you can talk. During the visit, you discuss your symptoms and get the care you need.
Emergency & Urgent Care
In case of medical emergency, call 911. That means difficulty breathing or another emergency medical condition. It is recommended to call the ER so they can prepare for your arrival and limit your exposure to others.
Coronavirus testing locations
Only patients who have been previously evaluated by an AHN-affiliated health care provider for COVID-19 symptoms and who have a valid prescription order from their doctor may be tested at the collection sites at this time.
