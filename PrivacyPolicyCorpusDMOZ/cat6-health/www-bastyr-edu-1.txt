The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA) requires that postsecondary institutions participating in federal student aid programs ensure that various institutional information and policies be made available to students.  The following information is disclosed to you as a current or prospective student of Bastyr University in compliance with federal law and other law.
Academic Programs and Accreditations

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
Bastyr University conforms to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), commonly known as the Buckley Amendment, which requires that Bastyr adopt guidelines concerning the right of a student to inspect her/his educational records and guidelines concerning the release of personally identifiable information to third parties. The Act further provides that such a student has the right to a hearing in order to provide for the correction or deletion of inaccurate, misleading or otherwise inappropriate data and provides that students be informed annually of the types of educational records maintained by the University that are directly related to students. Consistent with that act, the University's policy on Compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is established to ensure that information contained in such records is treated in a responsible manner with due regard to the personal nature of the information. Prospective and incoming students are not covered under FERPA.
Financial Aid
The Financial Aid section of the Bastyr University website provides the types of financial aid available; eligibility requirements and procedures for applying for aid; financial aid terms and conditions, including rights and responsibilities of students; and whom to contact for more information.
Third Party Servicers
Bastyr University does not issue financial aid reimbursements in-house, instead we are contracted with a third party servicer, Nelnet Business Solutions, to issue payments directly to our students.  Through a monthly service plan, Bastyr utilizes the Nelnet Campus Commerce tool to issue payments for students via check or direct deposit.  The funds are generated from Bastyr and transfer directly to students through a secured process to provide maximum security.  The students are not required to pay any fees, or set up accounts with a specified lender under this agreement.
Bastyr University utilizes the National Student Loan Clearinghouse as a third party servicer to report enrollment information to the Department of Education for loan deferment purposes, and for research purposes.
Bastyr University has a contract with Inceptia as a third party servicer to provide default prevention and financial literacy services to our students and our former students.
For more information on third party servicers, please contact Danette Wells, Director of Financial Aid, at dwells@bastyr.edu.
