Disclosures to Third Parties
At times, RadiologyInfo engages third party contractors, service providers, and other vendors to help us accomplish our business objectives. There are other circumstances where we are required by law to disclose personal data to third parties such as public bodies or judicial authorities.
We occasionally engage third party contractors to conduct usability testing and/or focus groups and to assist us in creating content.

A contract to protect the personal data is executed before any data is disclosed, if that vendor will process personal data of individuals in the EU/EEA on our behalf.

Occasionally RadiologyInfo may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena in cooperation with a law enforcement investigation. RadiologyInfo reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

You can contact us at any time to discuss your privacy concerns.
Legal basis for data collection and use:
We only collect and use personal data when there is a fair and legal basis for its collection and use; for instance, when the collection of personal data is necessary to respond to a user's inquiry, to meet our legitimate interests to send marketing material, to comply with legal obligations or when we have your authorization.

International transfers of personal data
If you are located outside the United States and you interact with our website or provide us personal data, then your personal data may be transferred to the United States.
We transfer your personal data to the United States whenever you interact with us.
The US has not sought, nor obtained adequacy status from the European Union. The EU-US Privacy Shield framework obtained an adequacy decision. The level of protection of your personal data is not deemed equivalent to the one in the EU, unless the receiving organization is self-certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield or implements other approved transfer mechanisms. As a not-for-profit organization, we are not able to adhere to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, nor implement other transfer mechanisms.
We transfer your personal data on the basis of the derogations in Article 49 GDPR, particularly:
Necessity to enter and for the performance of a contract for information to participate in our events; for processing personal data of our committee members and medical advisors to maintain their relationship with our organization and to provide them services including when they log in to their member accounts.
Explicit consent, for email subscribers and certain processing in relation to organizing events - such as storing photos, and marketing activities.
As for safeguards to your personal data, we directly apply the GDPR provisions to your personal data. As a matter of principle, we do not engage in any onward transfers regarding your data, beyond the access that our processors have to your data. We select carefully our processors and we require that they provide equivalent safeguard mechanisms.
Data security
RadiologyInfo is committed to the security, confidentiality and integrity principle. We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our members, medical advisors, and online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures.
Security measures:
We use identification and authentication processes to insure that access to PII is limited to RSNA and ACR employees and RadiologyInfo committee members who require it. Offsite access to sensitive information requires the use of a VPN. When compiling statistics, we anonymize data and report on aggregate measures. We employ encryption technology to protect data at rest and in transit.
You should be aware, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. This site contains links to other sites. While RadiologyInfo strives to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, RadiologyInfo is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.
RADIOLOGYINFO MAKES NO CLAIMS, PROMISES OR GUARANTEES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR ADEQUACY OF THE CONTENTS OF ITS SITE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE CONTENTS OF THIS SITE. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, IMPLIED, EXPRESSED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS, IS GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENTS OF THIS WEBSITE OR ITS HYPERLINKS TO OTHER INTERNET RESOURCES. REFERENCE IN THIS WEBSITE TO ANY SPECIFIC COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR SERVICES, OR THE USE OF ANY TRADE, FIRM OR CORPORATION NAME IS FOR THE INFORMATION AND CONVENIENCE OF THE PUBLIC AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ENDORSEMENT OR RECOMMENDATION BY RADIOLOGYINFO.
Retention periods
RadiologyInfo applies the storage limitation principle in order to retain personal data in our records only for the length of time required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected.
According to our retention policy
We only keep personal data in our records as long as they are necessary for the purposes they have been processed. The retention period depends on the context in which we process data, for instance:
