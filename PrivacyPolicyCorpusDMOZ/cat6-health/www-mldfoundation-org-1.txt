We are occasionally asked if the logo can be reproduced in some form for fundraising, tatoos, personal projects, or other purposes. Permission must be requested in writing, in advance, and may or may not be granted after careful consideration of how the logo is proposed to be used. More details can be found here. If the proposal includes selling an item with some embodiment of the logo as a fund raiser, the details of the fund-raiser should also be provided, including any representations as to the tax deductibility of contributions and how MLD Foundation will be connected to the logo use.

NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY
MLD Foundation does not advocate, support, or practice unlawful discrimination based on age, ethnicity, gender, national origin, disability, race, size, religion, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic background.
We reserve the right to limit access to resources to any person(s) not respecting the values, decisions, ethics, or privacy of others.
WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY
Guidestar and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require this policy ... If any employee, volunteer, or affiliate [person] of MLD Foundation reasonably believes that some policy, practice, or activity of
MLD Foundation is in violation of law, a written complaint must be filed by
that person with the Executive Director or the Board President.
It is the intent of MLD Foundation to adhere to all laws and regulations that
apply to the organization and the underlying purpose of this policy is to support
the organization’s goal of legal compliance. The support of all persons is
necessary to achieving compliance with various laws and regulations. A person is protected from retaliation only if the person brings the alleged
unlawful activity, policy, or practice to the attention of MLD Foundation and
provides MLD Foundation with a reasonable opportunity to investigate
and correct the alleged unlawful activity. The protection described below is only
available to persons that comply with this requirement.
MLD Foundation will not retaliate against a person who in good faith,
has made a protest or raised a complaint against some practice of MLD Foundation, or of another individual or entity with whom MLD Foundation has a business relationship, on the basis of a reasonable belief that the practice is
in violation of law, or a clear mandate of public policy.
MLD Foundation will not retaliate against
persons who disclose or
threaten to disclose to a supervisor or a public body, any activity, policy, or
practice of MLD Foundation that the employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, or a rule, or regulation mandated pursuant to law or is in
violation of a clear mandate of public policy concerning the health, safety,
welfare, or protection of the environment.
DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION POLICY
Guidestar and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require this policy ... MLD Foundation acknowledges its responsibility to preserve information relating to litigation, audits and investigations.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of July 30, 2002, makes it a crime to alter, cover up, falsify, or destroy any document to prevent its use in an official proceeding.
Failure on the part of employees, volunteers, or affiliates to follow this policy can result in possible civil and criminal sanctions against MLD Foundation and its employees and possible disciplinary action against responsible individuals (up to and including termination of employment).
Each employee has an obligation to contact the Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee, Executive Director or the Board President of a potential or actual litigation, external audit, investigation or similar proceeding involving MLD Foundation that may have an impact as well on the approved records retention schedule.
Most documents will be archived electronically with reasonable efforts to back up these archives. Giving records, federal and state tax & corporate documents will be retained at least as long as statutes require. Giving records will be archived in a similar fashion, however, while we normally use a 3rd party merchant processing service to avoid any contact with credit card numbers we occasionally process manual transactions in which case records or the transaction are retained but the credit card number is disposed of (deleted or shredded) as soon as practical and is not archived. The occasional credit card number sent by email may be inadvertently backed up as part of our email archives.
ONLINE DONATIONS & PAYMENTS, Including ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
Compliance with PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy when using their services for payment and donation processing are acknowledged herein by reference.
Donations and purchases are by rule not refundable, however, in the case of administrative error please contact us to request an adjustment or refund. Donations generally are tax deductible, your receipt and/or the context in which the donation was made will determine the deductibility. Purchases are usually partially deductible for the donation made in excess of the value of the item purchased and will be indicated as such on your receipt. Always check with your accountant or tax advisor for accurate advice.
Re-occurring/scheduled donations will generally not be scheduled for a period longer than 1 year, after which they must be renewed.
Donations and payments made by PayPal, Google, and Square are processed by 3rd parties. When using these 3rd parties, MLD Foundation never sees, captures or stores your personal credit card or banking information.
