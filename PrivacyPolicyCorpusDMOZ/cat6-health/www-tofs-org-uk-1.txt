Member Feedback
To all at TOFS, just a really big THANK YOU for being there. All I wanted was just for someone to listen and understand and you were there for me. Jo Wright, parent of a child born with OA/TOF
We wanted to thank you again for all the support you have given us over the phone and through your newsletter, website and online forum.  We have found TOFS an invaluable resource and spread the word wherever we can about the great work you do. Joanne and John Winspear, parents
The TOFS support group does exactly what it says on the tin!  It supports.  And that’s a very reassuring feeling - talking to people who have been there. You guys do a wonderful job. Rachel Simpson, parent
During my working life as a paediatric surgeon I learned as much, if not more about TOF from parents and from TOFS meetings as I did from learned journals. Leela Kapila, past Vice-President of the Royal College of Surgeons
When I read Chew, I’m encouraged by reading about the positive side of OA/TOF and the achievements of all the children and TOF adults. TOFS, the website, the Forum and Chew have all been a marvellous source of information and encouragement for us. Rachel and Mark Hayes, parents
Our bumpy ride has been so much easier with TOFS; just listening to other people’s experiences and knowing someone is there. Charlie and Lesley Cochrane, parents
