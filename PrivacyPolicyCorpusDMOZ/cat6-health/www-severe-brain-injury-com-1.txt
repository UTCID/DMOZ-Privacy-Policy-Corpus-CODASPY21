Privacy
We are committed to maintaining
your confidence and trust, and maintain the following standard
privacy policy.
We do not collect any personal
information from our visitors for any purpose whatsoever. We do
not send mass mailings of any kind.
"Our web server is not set
up to track, collect or distribute personal information about
any of its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors,
but not email addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet
Service Provider our visitors may use, but not the names, addresses
or other information about our visitors that would allow us to
identify the particular visitors to our sites.
Our web site does track information
about the visits to our web site. For example, we compile stats
that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily
requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and
what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics
are used for internal analysis to better provide services to the
public but the statistics contain no personal information and
cannot be used to gather such information."
The sites listed on and advertised
on here, for example in the Open Directory listings, have privacy
policies which are outside our control.
