A change in diet may protect against gut-bacteria dysfunction that leads to lupus in mice, University of Florida Health researchers have found.
In this video, Laurence M. Morel, Ph.D., a professor in the UF College of Medicine’s department of pathology, immunology and laboratory medicine; and Mansour Mohamadzadeh, Ph.D., a department of medicine professor, explain how a diet low in the amino acid tryptophan has protective effects against lupus in preclinical models. The disease causes the immune system to attack normal, healthy tissue throughout the body.
