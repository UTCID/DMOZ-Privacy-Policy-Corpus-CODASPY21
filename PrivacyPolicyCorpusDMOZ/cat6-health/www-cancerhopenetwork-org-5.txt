"After going through my cancer I wanted to help others. I learned that Cancer Hope Network's personal,
one-to-one contact with patients is a beautiful, complete volunteer experience."  Peter
Our Support Volunteers are at the heart of everything we do – creating hope and inspiring patients and caregivers in their fight against cancer. Support Volunteers are at least one year post-treatment or are successfully undergoing maintenance therapies.
Volunteers participate in a training session that covers important policies and procedures and includes communication tips and role playing exercises. Training outlines the roles and responsibilities of a Support Volunteer and teaches techniques for working with patients in the most helpful ways.
Cancer Hope Network Support Volunteer training sessions are held regularly in the greater New York metro area (including Connecticut, New Jersey & Pennsylvania). We also offer online trainings for volunteers across the nation and in Canada.
For additional information or details, please call us at 877-HOPENET (877.467.3638) or use the form to start the process.
