Hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis is a condition that causes heavy sweating in the palms of your hands, or face, underarms and sometimes feet. People with this condition may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest.
Tests & diagnosis
Starch-iodine test is when an iodine solution is applied to the sweaty area and starch is sprinkled over the iodine solution. The starch-iodine combination will turn a dark blue color indicating where there is excess sweat production.
Paper test involves placing a paper on the affected area to absorb sweat, and then weighed to determine the amount of sweating that occurs.
Laboratory tests such as blood work that may be conducted.
Treatments
Video-assisted sympathectomy is a minimally invasive procedure where a surgeon cuts or clamps the sympathetic nerve chain, which runs along your spine. This prevents the brain from sending signals to the involved areas to make them sweat. We perform this procedure through several small incisions, using a tiny camera (thoracoscope) and sleek surgical instruments. The thoracoscope transmits images of the inside of your body onto a video monitor, guiding the surgeon in performing the procedure.
