Nephrology & Autoimmune Kidney Disease
When your immune system mistakenly targets your own kidney cells and tissues, it’s called autoimmune kidney disease. At the Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Autoimmunity Institute, you will receive outstanding care from physicians who specialize in complex autoimmune kidney concerns, such as glomerulonephritis.
Our institute approach makes it easy for you to see different specialists — and address more than one care concern — in just one visit.
Specialized care for glomerulonephritis and other kidney concerns
Glomerulonephritis is a condition marked by inflammation of the kidneys. An immune system response causes it. At our Autoimmunity Institute, we offer a glomerulonephritis clinic that provides highly specialized care not available elsewhere in the region.
Our board-certified nephrologists have many years of experience caring for people with glomerulonephritis and other types of autoimmune kidney disease. We provide diagnostic, follow-up, and therapeutic care to help you manage this complex condition long term. For your comfort and convenience, we also offer advanced immunosuppressant infusion therapies at our on-site infusion suite.
Because of the unique nature of our institute, we’re able to care for patients who have other autoimmune conditions that may affect the kidneys. If an autoimmune condition affects other areas of your body, you can often get care from other specialists on the same day.
A new approach to autoimmune kidney disease care
Caring for an autoimmune disease can be hard and confusing. We’re changing that. We’ve brought together 15 different kinds of autoimmune specialists so you get more complete care. When you choose our Autoimmunity Institute for autoimmune kidney care, you benefit from our:
