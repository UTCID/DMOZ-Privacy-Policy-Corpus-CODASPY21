Thoracic Surgery
Our Thoracic Surgery program provides a unique patient care experience. Our practice is one of the largest in the country, our thoracic surgeons are among the finest in the world, and our measureable outcomes compare favorably to national benchmarks. We have created a unique patient-centered model of care that integrates a community of radiologists, anesthesiologists, nurses and support staff who specialize in comprehensive treatment of thoracic disease. Treatment is tailored to each patient, and often includes ground-breaking procedures with results that set the standard for patient care, and offer the best opportunity for the superior outcomes our patients deserve. Surgeons in the Division of Thoracic Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH)— faculty members at Harvard Medical School—provide expert and personalized diagnostic and treatment services to patients with disorders of the lung and airway, esophagus, mediastinum and chest wall; benign and malignant tumors; and chronic pulmonary diseases.
Our team of thoracic surgeons has made distinctive contributions to the field of thoracic surgery, improving the lives of patients throughout the United States and beyond. We train the next generation of thoracic specialists through BWH’s Cardiothoracic Residency Program and constantly seek to improve patient care through scientific research and clinical trials that focus on new evaluation and innovative treatment methods.
We offer a multidisciplinary approach that integrates patient and family needs with the expertise of our thoracic surgeons and other BWH specialists, as well as physician assistants, nursing staff, social workers, nutritionists, respiratory therapists and other health care workers specializing in thoracic surgery. This patient-centered environment has informative, compassionate care at its core, with the very best in advanced medical and surgical techniques and superior outcomes. Thoracic surgery services are available at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. In addition, thoracic surgery services are available in Weymouth and Milford.
