Further services
Disclosure of Personal Data
We may disclose your personal data to the following recipients and for the following purposes:
To our service providers; these service providers, sub-contractors and subsidiaries include providers of information technology, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services;
If you expressly request us to do so;
If the disclosure is necessary to comply with a court order or a legal or regulatory requirement; or
We may from time to time disclose contact information between members as part of our membership services to put them in touch with each other.
Our service providers may be located outside the country where a visitor is located. As a result, a visitor’s information may be transferred outside the country where they are located. All our service providers are contractually bound to process personal data only on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions. We also oblige them to comply with technical and organisational measures ensuring the protection and security of personal data. If a service provider is located in a country where the applicable laws do not provide an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will ensure by appropriate means that the respective data recipients maintain such adequate level of data protection.
The third parties will only use personal data for the agreed purpose and not sell it to third parties or market it otherwise.
Security and Confidentiality
To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data collected online, we use data networks protected, inter alia, by industry standard firewall and password protection. In the course of handling your personal data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect such data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Social Plug-ins
Our Site contains links to the external social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn and you may share on social networks the content of our Site.
This Site uses a safe sharing tool which establishes a direct contact between the social networks and users only after users click on one of the respective buttons. This tool does not automatically transfer user data to the operators of such platforms. If users are logged into one or more of the social networks, the use of social buttons for Facebook, Twitter, etc. will display an information window in which the user can confirm the text before it is sent. The user can share the content of this Site on social networks without their providers creating profiles of users’ surfing behavior.
Cookies
Cookies are text files placed on your device to help analyze how you use our Site. After the browser session, most of the cookies we use are deleted from your device (session cookies). Other cookies remain on your device (permanent cookies) and permit its recognition at your next visit to our Site. This allows us to better serve you with tailored information and to facilitate your on-going access to, and use of, the Site. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage and control them through your browser, including removing cookies by deleting them from your 'browser history' (cache) when you leave the Site. Please note that deactivating cookies may affect your browsing experience.
Hotjar cookies
We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf. For further details, please see the ‘about Hotjar’ section of Hotjar’s support site.
You can opt-out to the creation of a user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about your usage of our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites by following this opt-out link.
Google Analytics
This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Site analyse how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States and stored there. In case of activated IP anonymization on this Site, however, your IP address is previously truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our Site, compile reports about Site activities, and provide us with further services related to Site and Internet usage. The IP address sent from your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google. You can prevent storage of cookies by appropriately setting your browser software; in this case, however, please note that you might not be able to fully use all functions offered by our Site. In addition, you can prevent data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of our Site (including your IP address) from being collected and processed by Google, by downloading and installing a browser plug-in from the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
This Site uses Google Analytics with the extension "anonymizeIP()"; IP addresses are therefore truncated before further processing in order to rule out direct associations to persons.
Your Rights
We will delete the personal data collected about you if all processing purposes have been fulfilled unless statutory retention obligations apply.
You have the right to request access to, or transfer of, the personal data we process about you, to request correction of any incorrect personal data, restriction of access to, and deletion of, personal data, always to the extent these rights are granted by applicable. Furthermore, if you believe that your rights granted by applicable data protection laws have been infringed, you may lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority.
For questions or queries please contact us at: privacy@uicc.org or write to Maria Barbara Leon, 31-33 Avenue Giuseppe-Motta, 1202 Geneva – Switzerland.
