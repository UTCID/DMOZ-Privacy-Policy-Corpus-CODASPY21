Privacy
Privacy is reinforced in all of Infoway’s initiatives through its funding model, the Digital Health Blueprint, associated privacy and security architecture, requirements and considerations, pan-Canadian common understandings and white papers.
Infoway also works closely with the jurisdictions through working groups such as the Privacy Forum and the Health Information Privacy Group, to identify practices that can be leveraged for re-use across the country.
