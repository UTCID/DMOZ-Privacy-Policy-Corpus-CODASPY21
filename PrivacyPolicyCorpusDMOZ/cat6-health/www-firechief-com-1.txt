PRIVACY POLICY
This Web site is owned and operated by:

2611 Internet Blvd., Ste. 100

We are committed to maintaining your confidence and trust with respect to the information we collect from you. This privacy policy applies to www.FireChief.com (“Fire Chief”) sets forth what information we collect about you, how we use your information, and the choices you have about how we use your information.
Fire Chief is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. As a policy, we will not sell or otherwise misuse your personal information. Your personal information helps us customize Fire Chief to your interests and allows us to negotiate valuable member discounts and related services. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.
This privacy policy was last updated on 04/27/2018
What personal information does FIRE CHIEF collect from me?
Fire Chief collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Fire Chief asks all users for your name, date of birth, email address, city, occupation, department information, industry and personal interests. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Fire Chief - you will select an appropriate Fire Chief username and then given access to Fire Chief's many offerings.
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information (such as the above) at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Fire Chief and/or our many partners; when you post a Fire Chief Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact Fire Chief we may keep a record of that correspondence. Fire Chief also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Fire Chief collects personal information we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
What are cookies/tracking technologies and how does FIRE CHIEF use them?
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Fire Chief and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
We use cookies to:
Remind us of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie passes your username and password when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. Other submitted personal information such as occupation and city are not linked to cookies.
Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Fire Chief is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.
Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a Fire Chief-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.
Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Fire Chief's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on Fire Chief a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

For example, some Fire Chief services, like BLUtube, are offered as a brand of Fire Chief using the same infrastructure and member database. This information is stored within a cookie during login and not otherwise collected by a partner company for any purpose. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Fire Chief, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. Our privacy policy does apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites. You should read the privacy statement of our co-branded partner. If you have any questions about the use of your information by co-branded sites or experience login problems on a co-branded site please visit the technical support section.

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give Fire Chief permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?
Your Fire Chief Account Information and Fire Chief Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your Fire Chief Account Information and Fire Chief Profile by using your Fire Chief ID and password.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Fire Chief will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Fire Chief account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Fire Chief cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
What security precautions are in place to protect the identity and security of Law Enforcement officials on FIRE Chief?
Fire Chief has taken several precautions to protect the identity, account names and passwords of officers when they register and log on to FireChief.com. All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure and Fire Chief is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use Fire Chief at your own risk.
Testimonials
We periodically post member testimonials on Fire Chief which may contain personal information such as the member's username. We do obtain the member's consent prior to posting each testimonial. If you have any questions regarding testimonials on Fire Chief or would like a testimonial that includes your personal information removed please contact us.
Social Media Widgets
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Changes in this Privacy Statement
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.
If you ever have questions regarding the Fire Chief privacy policy please email customersupport@FireRescue1.com.
