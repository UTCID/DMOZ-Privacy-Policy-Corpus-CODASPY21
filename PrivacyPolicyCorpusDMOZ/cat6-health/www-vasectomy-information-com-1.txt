The advertisers and/or products are chosen for us by the affiliate program, but should be appropriate to the page content.
Although the webmaster regularly checks what adverts appear on the Google banners, it should be appreciated that the banners and the adverts contained within the banners are the responsibility of the banner host, and not the webmaster of this site.
