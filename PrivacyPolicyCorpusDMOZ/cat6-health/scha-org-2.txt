Services provided by SCHA may be supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions. These advertisements may be prompted by access to content, queries made through the Services or other information. The manner, mode and extent of advertising on the Services are subject to change without specific notice to you. In consideration for SCHA granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that SCHA may place such advertising on the Services.

Changes to these Terms
SCHA may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, any new Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the Services. You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date as of which the Terms have changed, SCHA will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms. If we make changes to these Terms of Use Policy that materially modify our rights, we will notify you to obtain your consent either through an email or a prominent posting on this Web Site.
Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration and No Class Relief
Except with regard to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement contained herein, which shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, the Terms, Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by SCHA on the Site shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of South Carolina, without regard to conflict of law principles.
In the unlikely event an issue arises, except in relation to intellectual property rights as set forth above, SCHA and the User each agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to, in any way without limitation, the Terms, the Privacy Policy, or the use of the Site, through binding arbitration with no class relief, instead of in courts. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Any arbitration under this provision will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. The arbitration shall occur in Columbia, South Carolina. Unless the parties mutually agree to the contrary in writing, the decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act.
Failure by SCHA to enforce any provision(s) of the Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If any provision of the Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The User may not assign, transfer, or otherwise convey any rights granted hereunder; provided that, SCHA may assign any of the foregoing without notice or prior written consent. The Terms shall inure to the benefit of SCHA, its successors and assignees. The Terms, the Privacy Policy, and any other legal notices published by SCHA on the Site, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and SCHA regarding use of the Site.
