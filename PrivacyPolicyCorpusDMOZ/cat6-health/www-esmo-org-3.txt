Provision of Membership Services
Collection and dissemination of education and scientific information
Provision of Products and Services
The sources of personal information received by ESMO are:
The individuals themselves
Third parties acting on behalf of individuals (e.g. an agent or secretary arranging registration for an ESMO organised meeting or event; abstract submission, etc.)
ESMO may collect personal information in particular in the following ways:

Abstract submission: When you, or someone on your behalf, submits proposals or content in connection with scientific sessions at an ESMO organised meeting or event
Subscribe to ESMO Newsletters: When you subscribe to an ESMO Newsletter, Digital Magazine, or other electronic communication

For further information about security, please refer to our Data Security Policy.Email addressYour email address is mandatory when you use ESMO electronic services on the ESMO Website.Electronic communication is for most purposes ESMO’s preferred method of communication because it is fast, environmentally friendly, and efficient.You are required to supply your email address when you create your ‘myESMO’ account on the ESMO Website. This enables you to access a variety of services online.Unique Email AddressFor your security, ESMO does not permit two different individuals to have the same email address in the system. You are strongly recommended to use an email address that is personal to you and that is not shared with others. This is to ensure that communications that are sent to you personally are not read by others and that others do not gain access to the information in your ‘myESMO’ account. Furthermore, ESMO may use your email address to communicate with you about value added products linked either to your membership or your congress attendance.Your unique email permits the automated retrieval of your login details, which are sent to your personal email address.Data from surveys and questionnairesESMO conducts a number of surveys or questionnaires whereby we collect data from volunteer respondents about topics that are of interest to the Society or to the practice of oncology. The respondent data remains completely anonymous, unless the respondents specifically choose to share their contact data.

In some cases, your personal data will also be transferred to countries outside of the EU (so-called third countries). Please note that some of the jurisdictions in third countries do not offer the same level of data protection as the member states of the EU. ESMO applies administrative, physical, and technical data protection safeguards intended to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data.Listed below are some of the security procedures that ESMO uses to protect your privacy:

Google Analytics App Tracking uses “ID’s”, which are identifier generated and saved on your device, to help us analyse how the app is being used across users. The information about your use of the app (including your IP address) which is generated by the ID will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymisation, Google will truncate/anonymise the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information on our behalf for evaluating your use of the app, compiling reports on your activity in the app, and other services relating to app activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the logging of the information about your use of the app (including your IP Address) generated by the ID of Google Analytics App Tracking by selecting “disable Google Analytics” in the settings of the app. Henceforth, any further tracking will be stopped as you will have “opted-out“ by selecting the disable setting. However, please note that this applies only to this version of the app. In other apps tracking still might be activated. In this app the IP anonymisation is activated. More information about the terms and conditions and the privacy policy can be found under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/ and https://www.google.com/policies/ (2) You have the possibility to create notes and bookmarks.iOS user: This data will not be saved on your device and will be lost in the case of an app update or the reinstallation of the app on your device.
