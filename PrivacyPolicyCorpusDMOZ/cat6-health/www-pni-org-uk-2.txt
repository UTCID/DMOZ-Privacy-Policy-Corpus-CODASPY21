When you supply any personal information to PNI ORG UK (e.g. for registrations, chat comments, topics, posts or private messages etc), we have legal obligations towards you in the way we deal with that data.

About Cookies and the Way We Use Them
In common with other websites, we do use “cookies”. A cookie is a small file that a Website puts on your hard drive so that it can remember something about you at a later time. Our system uses a cookie to record a unique reference on your computer so that we can keep track of your local sites. You can control the use of cookies on your computer and can turn them on or off at anytime (please refer to your internet browser). However, if you do turn cookies off you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. You can get more information about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. In order that we can monitor and improve the site, we may gather certain information about you when you use it, including details of your domain name and IP address, operating system, browser version. Please note: We do not use cookies to store any of your personal information held on your computer.
3rd Party Advertising Cookies
Some adverts on our pages come from third party sources; some of these third parties use their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people have seen it more than once. The companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies, and we have no access to read or write these cookies.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, no part of our website is structured to attract minors.
