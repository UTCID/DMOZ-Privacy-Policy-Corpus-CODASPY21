Targeted Advertising Disclosure – When You Consent to the Cookie Consent
We use third party advertising companies to place our ads on other websites. One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies and social media  (“Network Advertisers”) with whom we work to place their own cookies on the browser of an individual who visits one or more of our sites and who clicks “accept” on the cookie consent banner on the site. This enables these Network Advertisers to place a cookie on your computer and to receive information (including for example your IP Address, internet tracking data, and advertising IDs) from that cookie that may include information about your visits to this and other websites.  This data received by Network Advertisers allows them to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements on other websites about our goods and services that are tailored to you and that may be of interest to you on these other websites.  These Network Advertisers may in turn disclose your cookie data to other network advertisers to allow these advertisers to display ads to you as well.  Under CCPA these additional disclosures may be considered a sale of personal information
To revoke your consent or opt-out after you have consented to the cookie consent banner, or to manage your cookie preferences, you can delete the cookies on your browser or use the cookie settings on your browser.   All browsers are different, so visit the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to delete the cookies we set in your browser, including the cookie consent, and about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.  You can opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from Network Advertisers by clicking the “Ad Options” icon on the advertisements or by going to www.networkadvertising.org.  In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance maintains a web site where consumers can opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of the network advertising companies participating in the program (www.AboutAds.info/choices).
You can read more about our general advertising and cookie practices in our United States Website Privacy Statement.
Does Allergan “Sell” Your Personal Information?

Right Not to Be Subject to Discrimination.
Should you exercise any of your privacy rights as a California Consumer, we will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of services, based solely upon your request.  However, in some circumstances, for example where you have requested or consented to our services that use your Personal Information to provide the service, we may not be able to provide a service if you choose to delete your Personal Information.
To exercise any of these rights, or to designate an agent or authorized representative to act on your behalf, you can contact us through our designated CCPA processes by calling us at 1-800-344-1659 or by going to our CCPA Data Subject Rights Management System to submit an electronic form.  When you submit a Data Subject Rights request through one of these designated methods, we will use the information you submit and the information we have in our systems (or through the systems of our Service Provider if we use a Service Provider) to try to verify your identity and to match the personal information we have collected about you, if any, to your identity.  If we are successful in validating your identity, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by CCPA. If we cannot validate your identity, we will attempt to contact you to inform you of this issue.
