COOKIES
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer that are
used to identify you, often without your knowledge, while
visiting certain sites on the Internet. For example, cookies are

your favorite books to purchase, to remember what you had in your
shopping basket the last time you visited.

The cookies are used to facilitate the interaction between you
and our web pages. These cookies are used to collect or store
information on you and track you if you return to our website.

accessing your browser’s preferences menu and deleting existing
cookies. There also are commercial programs available to help you
manage cookies. Before taking such steps, you should be aware
that some websites, including ours, will not work properly if you
choose to block the placement of cookies on your computer. You
will need to decide whether enabling cookies outweigh privacy
concerns.
