Persons Involved in Your Health Care. Unless you object, we may disclose protected health information to a member of your family, relative, close friend, or other person identified by you who is involved in your health care or the payment for your health care.

IV. Your Rights Concerning Your Protected Health Information
You have the following rights concerning your protected health information. To exercise any of these rights, you must submit a written request to the Privacy Contact identified below or to the Health Information Management Department (Medical Records).
Right to Request Additional Restrictions to uses and disclosures.
You may request additional restrictions on the use or disclosure of your protected health information for treatment, payment, or health care operations.
We are required to review the restriction; however, we are not required to agree to a requested restriction except for a request to restrict disclosure of information to your insurance carrier or health plan, if the services that you do not want billed are paid for in full at the time of service.
If we agree to a restriction, we will comply with the restriction unless an emergency situation or the law prevents us from complying with the restriction, or until the restriction is terminated by you.
Right to Receive Communications by Alternative Means.
We normally contact you by telephone or mail at your home address. You may request that we contact you by some other method or at some other location. We will not ask you to explain the reason for your request. We will accommodate reasonable requests. We will provide information on any payment that may be applicable to the alternative communication request and discuss how you will handle this payment.
Right to Inspect and Copy Records.
You may inspect and/or obtain a copy of protected health information that is used to make decisions about your care or payment for your care. We may charge you a reasonable cost-based fee for providing the records. We may deny your request under limited circumstances, e.g., if you seek psychotherapy notes; information prepared for legal proceedings; or if disclosure may result in substantial harm to you or others.
Right to Authorize a Copy of Records to a Third Party.
You may authorize a copy of your protected health information be given to a third party.  We may charge a reasonable cost based fee for providing the records. The authorization must be signed by the patient or personal representative.
Right to Request Amendment to Record.
You may request that your protected health information be amended. You must explain the reason for your request in writing. We may deny your request if we did not create the record unless the originator is no longer available; if you do not have a right to access the record; or if we determine that the record is accurate and complete. If we deny your request, you have the right to submit a statement disagreeing with our decision and to have the statement attached to the record.
Right to an Accounting of Certain Disclosures.
You may receive an accounting of certain disclosures we have made of your protected health information within the last six years from the date of your request. We are not required to account for disclosures for treatment, payment, or health care operations; to family members or others involved in your health care or payment; for notification purposes; or pursuant to our facility directory or your written authorization.
