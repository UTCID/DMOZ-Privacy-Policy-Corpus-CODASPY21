Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected online from users of this website (“Site”). In this policy, you can learn what kind of information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we protect the information, and choices you have with respect to your personal information. By using or accessing the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of use, including without limitation the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, or use and disclosure of your information or personal information as set forth herein, you may not use this Site.
This Privacy Policy IS NOT the same as a Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices, which discusses how Visiting Angels uses and shares clients’ individually identifiable health information, among other things.  Your Visiting Angels’ Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices is available through another link called “HIPAA Privacy Practices,” which is located on the homepage of your Visiting Angels’ Site. You may also call your Visiting Angels’ offices at the phone number on the Site’s homepage and ask for a copy of the Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices at any time.
1. General Tracking Information
We keep track of the pages visited by each user. Our web server automatically collects some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users. This information does not identify you personally.
2. Click Path Tracking
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Visiting Angels and our affiliates, our marketing, testing and quality assurance partners, or our analytics, information technology and web monitoring service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Mobile applications may also use cookies. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality. We use Local Storage also referred to as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS’s.
We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner may use cookies, IP addresses, cookie identifiers, website activity, and/or Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
3. Collection of Personal Information
If you choose to register on our Site, you will be asked to provide Personal Information which may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number.
