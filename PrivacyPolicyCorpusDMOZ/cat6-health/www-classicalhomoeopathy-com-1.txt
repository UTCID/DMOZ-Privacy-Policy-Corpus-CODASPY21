What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is an alternative method of treatment, based on nature’s law of cure, namely ‘Like Cures Like’. The truth of this law was discovered by a German scientist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 and has been verified experimentally and clinically for 200 years. Homeopathy is the revolutionary, natural medical science. Homeopathy is a gentle and effective system of medicine. The remedies are prepared from natural substances to precise standards and work by stimulating the body’s own healing mechanisms.Learn More
