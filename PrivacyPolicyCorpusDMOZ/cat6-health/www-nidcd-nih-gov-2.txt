Linking Policy
Linking to Other Sites
Although organizations are welcome to link to the NIDCD website, NIDCD policy limits our own outside links. We link primarily to other federal government agencies and selected grantees, and selected organizations that provide useful information on communication disorders. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis. In addition, we provide links to the developers of tools that assist visitors in using website technology (for example, software to read PDFs).
The NIDCD provides external links solely for our users' information and convenience. When users select a link to an outside website, they are leaving the NIDCD site and are subject to the privacy limitations and policies of the owners/sponsors of that website. The NIDCD cannot control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked website. The NIDCD does not endorse the organizations sponsoring linked websites, and does not endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer. The NIDCD cannot guarantee that outside websites comply with Section 508 (Accessibility Requirements) of the Rehabilitation Act.
Review of Links
The links provided on the NIDCD website are reviewed at least each quarter, or more frequently as required by management and/or relevant regulation changes. The review is intended to ensure that links are still operational and valuable.
If you encounter a link that is no longer operational, please contact the NIDCD webmaster.

The No FEAR Act
The Notification and Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination and Retaliation (No FEAR) Act (Public Law No. 107-174) became effective on October 1, 2003. Its intent is to increase federal agency accountability for acts of discrimination or reprisal against employees. This act requires that federal agencies post on their public websites certain summary statistical data relating to equal employment opportunity complaints filed against the respective agencies.
In accordance with this act, statistical information relating to NIH equal employment opportunity complaints is available on the NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website.
Information Quality Guidelines
The NIDCD is a trusted source of information on communication disorders. Read more about HHS’s information quality guidelines.
