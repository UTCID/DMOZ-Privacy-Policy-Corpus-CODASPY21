We encourage you to periodically check our website for updates to this policy.Definition of Personal InformationPersonal information is any information recorded in any form that identifies or can identify an individual, other than an individual’s business contact information. Thus, personal information includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, credit card details or other financial information, health information, donation amounts and dates, volunteer information such as availability and areas of interest, history of involvement with MDC, and information required to maintain an employment relationship with MDC.Personal information does not include anonymous or aggregate information that cannot be tracked back to you personally.AccountabilityMDC accepts full responsibility for protecting personal information under its possession or control. Our Privacy Officer is accountable for the organization’s compliance with this policy. They can be reached at privacy@muscle.ca.The Senior Privacy Officer delegates responsibilities relating to privacy management, oversight and compliance to provincial representatives on an as-needed basis.The duties of the Senior Privacy Officer include:developing and, on a regular basis, reviewing MDC policies and practices to ensure consistent implementation and compliance;ensuring all staff are trained on privacy best practices and are aware of the importance of safeguarding any personal information to which they are privy;ensuring that all inquiries and complaints relating to privacy are appropriately handled;ensuring all third parties to whom MDC provides access to personal information adhere to appropriate standards of care in managing that information; andinforming the CEO and/or Board about significant privacy breaches that could potentially cause harm to MDC’s reputation.Identifying PurposesPersonal information is collected for purposes such as:providing neuromuscular-related support services and running MDC events;responding to any concerns or inquiries about MDC’s activities;fundraising and promoting MDC events and services;communicating with the community, including communications with donors, funders, partners and individuals that participate in MDC events or use MDC services;determining an individual’s suitability to be in a position of trust, including the handling of cash or working with vulnerable persons;accounting and other financial purposes such as issuing tax receipts; andmaintaining an employment relationship with employees of MDC.Should you choose, or are required as part of our support programs, to provide us with your health information, MDC does not collect or use this information to provide you with opinions or endorse any particular treatment option or course of action, nor do we use this information to make decisions on your behalf or provide you with medical referrals or advice.Aggregated information is used for service planning and delivery, health promotion, and the general administration of MDC’s business, including to assess the effectiveness of MDC programs and campaigns, improving donor experience and assisting in the developing new programs and channels. This information will be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and, unless we have your specific consent to use identified information, does not identify any individual and therefore is not treated as personal information under this policy.Each time an individual accesses the MDC website, we automatically receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information. Please refer to Website Practices on page 7 for more information.ConsentRequirements for consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information vary depending on circumstances and on the type of personal information. Consent can be obtained in person, by phone, by mail, or via the Internet.In determining whether implied or explicit consent is required and, if so, which form of consent is appropriate, MDC will take into account the sensitivity of the personal information at issue, the purposes for which MDC will use the information and any legal requirements. Consent may be implied based upon the reasonable expectations of the individual. For example, if you provide personal information in response to a fundraising communication, consent may be implied for the purposes of using the information for fundraising. In determining the appropriate form of consent, MDC will take into account the sensitivity of the personal information. Implied consent will generally be appropriate where the personal information is non-sensitive in nature and context. Express consent will always be sought should the primary purpose of collection be to promote a corporate partner product or should we wish to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as another charity.Your provision of personal information to MDC means that you agree and consent that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not provide any personal information to MDC. Failure to provide your personal information to MDC may prevent us from offering you the products or services you have requested.MDC will usually obtain your informed consent at the time that we collect your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any additional purposes that are not outlined in this policy, MDC will advise you of these new purposes before such use or disclosure, unless otherwise required by law.Consent may be time-limited and may be revoked by the individual who gave it, subject to legal restrictions, limited exceptions and reasonable notice. Withdrawal of consent will not exclude an individual from service delivery, unless the information requested is required to fulfill an explicitly specified and legitimate purpose.Limiting CollectionMDC only collects personal information for the purposes outlined under Principle 2Every MDCS department or business unit is responsible for ensuring that all information collected is limited, both in amount and type, to what is needed to fulfill the identified purposes.MDC usually collects personal information directly from the individual in the course of its business through various means including, but not limited to:registration and application forms;MDC programs and services;donor and fundraising forms; andon-line applications, services and systems.MDC may also collect personal information from other sources (including personal references and family members), with the consent of the individual or where permitted or required by law (for example, when the information is about a minor) or is publicly available.Limiting Use, Disclosure and RetentionPersonal information is only used and disclosed for the purposes for which it was originally collected (as outlined under Principle 2) unless specific consent has been obtained or if otherwise required by law. There are circumstances where a disclosure without consent is justified or permitted, for example in the context of a legal investigation or a request from law enforcement authorities, or where MDC believes, upon reasonable grounds, that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of an identifiable person or group.Also, note that your personal information may be shared with volunteers and service providers (collectively “Affiliates”). Such Affiliates assist us in establishing, managing and maintaining our relationship with you and providing products and services to MDC, such as mailing and fulfillment organizations and third party fundraising agencies. Such Affiliates will only use your personal information for the purposes identified above and are bound by confidentiality agreements and commit to safeguarding your personal information. Note that in working with our service providers, your personal information may be transferred to a foreign jurisdiction to be processed or stored. Such information may be provided to law enforcement or national security authorities of that jurisdiction upon request, in order to comply with foreign laws.Personal information is only retained as long as it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes identified in this policy (under Principle 2) and as required by law. MDC has established retention timelines for staff to follow and also periodically reviews MDC’s retention needs.The retention period may extend beyond your relationship with us. When your personal information is no longer required for MDC’s purposes, the information is either physically destroyed or deleted.AccuracyMDC makes reasonable efforts to keep personal information as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information is to be used.We rely on our donors, fundraisers, event participants, individuals who use the services of MDC, volunteers and employees to provide us with accurate information and to notify us if their information needs to be updated.SafeguardsMDC takes reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is kept safe from loss or theft, unauthorized access, use, copying, disclosure or modification. Safeguards include physical, organizational and technical measures, such as (but not limited to):security card access to premises;restriction of employee access to files on a “need to know” basis;confidentiality undertakings by all employees;locking up personal information and not leaving it unattended or in plain view;firewalls, anti-virus, strong passwords and software solutions for technical security (including secure, 128-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer sessions on our website); andregular reviews of privacy compliance initiatives.OpennessMDC always makes information available about our privacy practices upon request. MDC also takes steps to ensure that all staff/volunteers can answer inquiries about our information-handling practices and appropriately refer unanswered questions or privacy complaints to MDC’s Privacy Officer.Individual AccessAn individual should direct a request for access to their personal information to the Senior Privacy Officer in writing (contact information is set out at the end of this policy). The written request must provide sufficient detail so that the Senior Privacy Officer can properly and efficiently respond to the request.In order to safeguard personal information, an individual may be required to provide sufficient identification information in order for MDC to authenticate the individual and to authorize access to the individual’s file.MDC will respond to access requests in a timely manner, and in accordance with the timeframe prescribed by any relevant legislation.An individual may challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information obtained, if appropriate. MDC shall promptly correct or complete any personal information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the individual’s file. Where appropriate, MDC shall transmit to third parties having access to the personal information in question, any amended information or information regarding the existence of any unresolved differences.Individuals will be provided with any help needed to access their personal information, including clarifying exactly what they are looking for.
