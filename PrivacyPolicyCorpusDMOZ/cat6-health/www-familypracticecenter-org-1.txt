PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.• Purpose of this Notice: Northeast Iowa Family Practice Center (FPC) is required by law to maintain the privacy of certain confidential health care information, known as Protected Health Information(PHI), and to provide you with a notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to patients’ PHI. This Notice describes legal rights, advises of our privacy practices and outlines how FPC is permitted to use and disclose PHI about our patients.• FPC is also required to abide by the terms of the version of this Notice currently in effect. In most situations we may use this information as described in this Notice without permission, but there are some situations where we may use it only after we obtain our patients written authorization, if we are required by law to do so.• Uses and Disclosures of PHI: FPC may use PHI for the purposes of payment and health care operations, in most cases without written permission.Examples of our use of PHI:For treatment: This includes the provision, coordination, or management of health care and related services by one or more health care providers, including the coordination or management of health care by a health care provider with a third party; consultation between health care providers relating to a patient; or the referral of a patient for health care from one health care provider to another.For payment:This includes any activities we must undertake in order to get reimbursed for the services provided to our patients, including such things as organizing PHI and submitting bills to insurance companies (either directly or through a third party), management of billed claims for services rendered, medical necessity determinations and reviews, utilization review and collection of outstanding accounts.– FPC will not use or disclose more information for payment purposes than is necessary. This is known as using only the minimum necessary amount to accomplish the purpose of use or disclosure. We are accountable to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to safeguard (keep secure) and protect (keep private) our patients’ information.For health care operations: This includes quality assurance activities, licensing and training programs to ensure that our personnel meet our standards of care and follow established policies and procedures, obtaining legal and financial services, conducting business planning, processing grievances and complaints, creating reports that do not individually identify you for data collection purposes, fundraising and certain marketing activities.• Notification in the Case of a Breach:  FPC is required by law to notify our patients in case of a breach of their unsecured protected health information when it has been or is reasonably believed to have been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed in violation of privacy regulations. ©• For Fundraising Communications: We may contact you to request a tax deductible contribution to support important activities at Northeast Iowa Family Practice Center. In connection with any fundraising, we may disclose your demographic information and the dates when you received care here to our fundraising staff. You will have the option to opt-out of this fundraising information.• For Marketing Communications: We may use or disclose your health information to identify health-related services and products that may be beneficial to your health and we may contact you about these services and products. [All marketing requires an authorization, except face-to-face, prescription refill and general health reminders, and governmental notices. If there is reimbursement above costs, authorization is required]Use and Disclosure of PHI Without Your Authorization: FPC is permitted to use PHI without written authorization, or opportunity to object in certain situations, including:1. For FPC’s use in obtaining payment for services provided or in other health care operations;2. To another health care provider or entity for the payment activities of the provider or entity that receives the information (such as your hospital or insurance company);3. To another health care provider (such as the hospital) for the health care operations activities of the entity that receives the information as long as the entity receiving the information has or has had a relationship with our patients and the PHI pertains to that relationship;4. For health care fraud and abuse detection or for activities related to compliance with the law;5. To a family member, other relative or close personal friend or other individual involved in our patients care if we obtain verbal agreement to do so or if we give our patients an opportunity to object to such a disclosure and you do not raise an objection. We may also disclose health information to family, relatives or friends if we infer from the circumstances that there is no objection. For example, we may assume our patients’ patients agree to our disclosure of personal health information to their spouse when their spouse has called us for them. In situations where our patients are not capable of objecting (because the patients are not present or due to incapacity or medical emergency), we may, in our professional judgment, determine that a disclosure to our patient’s family member, relative or friend is in the best interest. In that situation, we will disclose only health information relevant to that person's involvement in our patient care;6. To a public health authority in certain situations (such as reporting a birth, death or disease as required by law, as part of a public health investigation, to report child or adult abuse or neglect or domestic violence, to report adverse events such as product defects or to notify a person about exposure to a possible communicable disease) as required by law;7.
