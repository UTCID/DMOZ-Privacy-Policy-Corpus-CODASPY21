NHI - Natural Health Institutes
Privacy Policy
Natural Health Institutes does not automatically collect personal and confidential information on the people who visit the NHI Web site. Here's how we handle the information we receive:
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
Every time you visit, we automatically store information on what Web browser you are using, what pages you are accessing, the date and time, and what site you came from. However, we don't know who you are. This type of information is used to identify trends and plan upgrades to the Web site. For example, if we notice a section of the site rarely gets visited, we may pull the material, or re-work it to make it more useful to visitors.
Personal Information
You may choose to provide us with personal information. For example, you may send us an e-mail that would identify you, or send personal details to a Natural Health Institutes employee. Such communications are governed by the same policy as any other conversation; that is, they are considered private and confidential. We will not release any of your personal information unless you specifically tell us to do so.
