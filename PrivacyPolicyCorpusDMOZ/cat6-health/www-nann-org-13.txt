Health Policy and Advocacy
Healthcare Reform: What Now?
Elizabeth Welch-Carre, EdD MSN APRN NNP-BC
Last week was dramatic in the Senate as several bills were introduced that would change or repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA). Ultimately, the Senate did not pass any legislation that affects the current healthcare law in place.
On July 25, the Senate passed a motion to begin debate to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by a vote of 51 to 50. All 48 Democrats and two Republican Senators opposed the motion. Vice President Pence cast the tie-breaking vote allowing the debate (Stark, 2017) and what is called “vote-o-rama” to commence. During this time period all members of Congress were invited to propose new amendments to be voted upon before the bill is finalized.
The final bill was brought to the floor in the form of a “skinny bill” which would have
removed some ACA mandates
increased the number of uninsured to 43 million by 2026 (CBO, 2016)
increased premiums for non-group members by as much as 20% (CBO, 2016).
The future of healthcare reform is unclear. The Senate GOP has stated that they intend to change their focus to other legislation, most notably tax reform and infrastructure. However, both parties have maintained that they want to improve and stabilize the current healthcare market (Schroeder, 2017). President Trump is encouraging Republicans to find a replacement bill for the ACA. A bipartisan group of House members, called the Problem Solvers Caucus, also are gathering to discuss ways to improve the existing healthcare law.
NANN will continue to provide updates and advocate for the following:
Medicaid coverage for infants who need it
no per capita cap, because many infants may reach that cap early in life
continued coverage of essential health benefits
ambulatory patient services
emergency services
hospitalization
maternity and newborn care
mental health and substance use disorder treatment, including behavioral health
prescription drug coverage
lab services
preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management
pediatric services such as oral and vision care
coverage of pre-existing conditions, because many infants have congenital conditions and many pregnant women and mothers have pre-existing conditions
continuation of individual mandates to increase the pool of funds to cover all individuals, rather than the use of costly high-risk pools
continuation of employer mandates because for many individuals, that is their primary means of obtaining insurance.
