HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE
Cleveland Clinic currently participates in health information exchanges (HIE’s), which ultimately help enhance the quality of your care.
The goal of the HIE’s is to help participating physicians and providers give better, more efficient care to their patients by the sharing of health information across secure systems. This means that wherever a patient goes, the patient’s health information may be available to all doctors who use the HIE’s, which helps to provide safer, more coordinated patient care.
Cleveland Clinic currently utilizes Care Everywhere, eHealth Exchange and Clinisync to access and share your health information with other participants of these HIE’s for treatment purposes and for payment of treatment services. These HIE’s allow any health information organization that participates in the HIE’s to have secure electronic access to patients’ records.
You may opt out of the Health Information Exchange by doing one of the following:
Send your request via email to CareEverywhere@ccf.org, with “Opt-Out” in the subject line; OR
Mail your written request, signed and dated to the Cleveland Clinic Privacy Office, 9500 Euclid Ave/DD2-20, Cleveland, OH 44195
Include all of the following with your request so we can be sure to identify the correct medical information to restrict from all the Health Information Exchanges that Cleveland Clinic participate in:
First and last name (and middle name, if applicable)
Cleveland Clinic medical record number
Date of birth
Address
Questions: Contact the Cleveland Clinic Privacy Office at 216.444.1709 (toll-free 800.223.2273, ext. 41709)
NOTICE: If you send health information to Cleveland Clinic via email, please know that your message may be sent in an unencrypted email. An unencrypted email means there is a risk that the information in the email and any attachments could potentially be read by a third party when it is sent through the internet.
