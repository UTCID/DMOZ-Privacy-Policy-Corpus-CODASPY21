Care For Other Conditions
If you are pregnant or have a chronic condition, you probably have a lot of questions on how COVID-19 affects your ongoing care.
Prescriptions
How can I get RX if needed?
Contact your health care provider to ask about obtaining extra necessary medications to have on hand in case there is an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community and you need to stay home for a prolonged period of time. If you cannot get extra medications, consider using mail-order for medications.
My existing appointments
What if I want to cancel my visit/appt.? Do I have to pay?
Contact your PCP or Specialist for their instruction.
Why are the doctors/office staff asking different questions than normal?
There is a CDC protocol for determining if patients are in need of testing for COVID-19. This may be what you are experiencing.
How does this affect my care plan/recovery?
Contact your PCP or Specialist for their instruction. At this time, elective procedures will likely be rescheduled.
Can I go to my facility?
How do I avoid getting sick while in the hospital or clinical setting?
Wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with those who are coughing, sneezing, or wheezing. The CDC now recommends wearing a mask while in public settings.
