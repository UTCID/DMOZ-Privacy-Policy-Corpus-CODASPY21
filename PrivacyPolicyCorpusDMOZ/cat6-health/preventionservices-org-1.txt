The Center for Prevention Services is committed to honoring the privacy and the wishes of our supporters at all times. We collect and maintain only personal information that is specifically and knowledgeably provided to us by individuals or their companies. We will never rent, exchange or sell information of our contributors. We will only share personally identifiable information with a third party if we are required to by law or when necessary for completing an authorized operation, for instance to process a credit card transaction, or if the person submitting the information asks that it be shared. We do maintain records on our contributors, which we regard as private and confidential and store securely with access limited to authorized staff.
If you provide us with contact information, we may contact you for additional information or send you updates about how donations are being put to use in our community. You can contact us to restrict our use of your contact information at any time.
In addition, like almost all Websites, we do collect broad, general statistical information about how visitors use our site, such as how often each page is visited, for the purpose of creating a better site for our community. We do not collect information on individual visits to the site without the expressed permission of the user.
There are links to other Websites throughout our site for the purpose of providing more useful and complete information to our visitors. We do not take responsibility for the contents or privacy practices of any Website other than our own. If you have any questions about our privacy policies, please contact us.
