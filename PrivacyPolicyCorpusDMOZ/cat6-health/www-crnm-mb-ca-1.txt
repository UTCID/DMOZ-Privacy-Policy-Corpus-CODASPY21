The College does not collect information through its website that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information voluntarily. In such cases, the College may collect, store and use such information in the same manner as it does other correspondence sent to the College. Unless it is required to do so by law, any such personal information about individual users will not be transferred by the College to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user.
The College may, from time to time collect traffic information regarding users' sessions, while the users remain anonymous, to permit statistical analyses of users' behaviour (for the purpose of improving the design of the website). Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data will be used for this purpose. The College will not seek to match IP addresses to identifiable individuals, unless the user is engaged in illegal behaviour.
