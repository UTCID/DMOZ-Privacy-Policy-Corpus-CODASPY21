Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.

The Owner honors DNT signals and this website does not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a DNT browser mechanism is in place.
California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. According to CalOPPA, the Owner agrees that users can visit this site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, the Owner will add a link to it on the footer of the home page. Learn More.
Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
This website, its offerings and the professional services are not intended or catered to anyone under the age of 13. This website does not specifically market to children under 13 and do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your children have provided the personal data through this website, please contact us. If the Owner becomes aware that the personal data from children was collected without verification of parental consent, the Owner will take steps to remove that information from his servers. Learn More.
