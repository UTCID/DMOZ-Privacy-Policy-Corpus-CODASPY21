Conflict of Interest Disclosure Policy
The purpose of a Conflict of Interest disclosure is to provide readers of published content with information about the author’s interests that have the potential to influence the content they create. A standard Conflicts of Interest Disclosure Policy will apply to individuals who are selected to author Blogs; individuals who participate in the AmericanEHR Podcasts as roundtable participants or interviewed guests; individuals who submit manuscripts or opinion pieces to be considered for publication on the AmericanEHR Partners website; and Peer Reviewed articles submitted for publication.
The following represents the types of relationships that the author or submitter is required to declare under the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Policy:
Financial relationships with any entities that have a commercial interest related to the authored work including employment by the entity, payment for consulting services, honoraria, payment for preparation of the submitted work, board membership, advisory panel membership, or ownership of shares in the entity. Financial relationships involving the submitter’s spouse, partner, or children under the age of 18 years. Individuals may declare any other conflicts of interest including personal, professional, or institutional conflicts. If no conflicts of interest exist, individuals shall provide a “no-conflict” declaration
Special Considerations for Users of EHRs
It is clearly recognized that certain contributors/authors may be users of EHRs:
As users, there may be a natural tendency to submit articles based upon their individual experiences with one or more EHR systems. Postings or content submitted by users of EHRs should be non-promotional in nature and should focus on principles of use rather than functionality related to their specific EHR. Articles or submissions that denigrate another vendor’s product or promote a specific vendor’s product or service shall not appear on the AmericanEHR Partners website.
