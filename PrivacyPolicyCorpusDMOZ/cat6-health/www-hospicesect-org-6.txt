Legacy Gifts
The Center for Hospice Care Legacy Society
Our Legacy Society is reserved for hospice donors who have included Center for Hospice Care in their estate plans. Membership in it represents the highest level of support we receive.
Estate gifts may be in the form of a bequest, a life insurance designation, a charitable trust, or any number of deferred gifts.
Legacy Society membership begins with a discussion with our leadership, and we invite you to initiate that conversation when you are ready.
For more information, please contact the Community Development office at 860.848.5699 or hhcahhospicenorwichinfo@hhchealth.org
