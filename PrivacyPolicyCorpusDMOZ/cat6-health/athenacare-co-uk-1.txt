Privacy Policy
Email Lists (Groups)
We will NOT give your email address to anyone else for any reason. It is used on our lists for introduction purposes only.
We will NOT give any information (your name or e-mail address combined with personal data) to anyone else for any reason.
We do NOT undertake direct bulk mailings.
If you receive a spam type email from a random name for example @athenacare.co.uk we did not send it. It was most likely sent from a service that sends large volumes of bulk spam email and ‘spoofed’ our email address domain (put our domain name as a return address). Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do currently to prevent this.
Membership Records and Personal Information
We do not store Membership records or any related personal information on any computer or server that is publicly accessible from the internet (such as a web server).
