Professional Team Members - Intro To Case Scenarios
The following is designed for Physicians, Dentists & Midwives.
These scenarios will help you make practical decisions when you're in a situation where someone's privacy or confidentiality might be compromised.
Read them and choose the answer that makes sense to you. A pop-up will explain why your answer is correct or incorrect. It may also direct you to some resources to help you with your decision making.
Scenario 1
You are a physician and have just seen a patient referred by a Family Physician.  Unfortunately, the patient was not able to provide you with enough information on this initial consult request.  The patient has left, so you contact the referring Family Physician.  Are you in breach of your patient's privacy?.
Choose the correct response:
Yes: I should have received consent first from the patient.
No: There is implied consent by the patient that there would be sharing of information from the referring Family Physician.
View Answer
The correct response is 2: No
There was an implied consent by the patient that there would be sharing of information from the Family Physician who referred the patient to you, so you can assess and appropriately treat the patient. The patient, by virtue of them being aware of the consult and arriving for the appointment, implies consent for the sharing of information.
Scenario 2
As a health professional, I have access to electronic patient records.  I can access any record I want to as long as I keep the information confidential.
True or False?
View Answer
The correct response is: False
Access only the information that is essential for you to do your work, whether it is providing direct care to a patient or providing services to the hospital. Accessing information that does not pertain to your work may result in disciplinary action.
Scenario 3
A physician enters an elderly patient's room to talk about some sensitive information regarding her diagnosis and possible treatments.  The patient has several visitors.
What should the physician do?
Proceed with the conversation
They're probably family members and they can be important to her recovery.
Inform the patient that you want to discuss information about or diagnoses.
Ask if the patient prefers that her visitors step out in the hall for a few minutes.  Proceed with the conversation once the patient has decided if the visitors can stay.
View Answer
The correct response is: "Inform the patient"
Confirming whether the visitors can stay will ensure that only the individuals who the patient requests will be present during the discussion of confidential information.
