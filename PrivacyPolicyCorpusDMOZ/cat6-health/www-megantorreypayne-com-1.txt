Make Your Appointment Today! Call 818-259-8372Confidentiality is critical in creating a safe, comfortable environment for you to be open with who you are, what changes you would like to see, and which roads to take on your journey.  As such, everything you say will be held completely private, except under specific legal limits, including:
a. Revealing to me active child abuse or neglect. If a perpetrator is in contact with minors and there is a reasonable suspicion that he or she may still be abusing minors. Revealing to me active physical abuse of a dependent adult or an elder.
b. If you seriously threaten harm or death to another person, I am required to warn the intended victim and notify the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
c. If you are in imminent danger of hurting yourself, I am permitted to break confidentiality in order to help ensure your safety.
