Terms and Conditions
APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP
Applications for membership will not be processed until receipt of completed form and payment. Please allow up to 10 working days for us to your process your application upon receipt of your payment.
Final confirmation of BSPED membership is upon approval of the BSPED Executive Committee which convenes quarterly.
MEMBERSHIP
The BSPED membership year runs from 1st August to 31st July. Applicants applying within the first nine months of the membership year will be expected to pay the full year’s membership fees. Membership fees will not be reduced on a pro-rata basis. Refunds will not be given for cancelled membership. Membership renewal notices will be sent approximately 1 month before the start of the membership year and as a BSPED member, you are expected to ensure that payment is effected in time.
Members who have not paid their membership fee by 1st February will be deemed as lapsed members and will not receive the newsletter and discounted registration to the BSPED conference, nor enjoy access to the members section of the BSPED website. Members whose membership has been allowed to lapse will not be eligible for a travel grant within their first year of reapplication. All members whose membership has been lapsed for more than 2 years must reapply for membership by completing a membership application form, and be endorsed by a new proposer.
All members whose membership has been lapsed for under two years will be expected to pay for the backdated year as well as the current one. This is due to membership staying active for 6 months of the year before being lapsed, so even those who had not paid their renewal fee would still have been able to enjoy the membership benefits throughout that time.
STUDENT MEMBERS
Student members must be in full-time education and must supply evidence of their status via a letter from their university tutor. Applicants with first degrees and studying for further qualifications are not eligible for the Student category of membership. The maximum student membership duration is 3 years, after which membership will be converted to a different category.  Proof of your student status will be required for each membership year and the office will be in contact ahead of the membership renewal to obtain this.
PERSONAL DETAILS
By applying for membership, you permit the BSPED and its professional secretariat provider BioScientifica Limited to process your personal details. As a BSPED member, you will receive mailings and email alerts from the BSPED on its own and related activities. You may unsubscribe from emails at any time by replying to bsped@endocrinology with ‘Unsubscribe’ in the subject line.
Please note that if you do opt out of future emails, you will still receive essential BSPED emails relating to your membership, such as renewal reminders, AGM notices and agendas.
As a BSPED member, your contact details will be included in the online membership directory which is located within the password protected members’ section of the BSPED website. The password protected members’ section is available to all fully paid-up BSPED members and enables your BSPED colleagues to contact you.
Please ensure that you keep the BSPED office informed of you up-to-date email address, as much of our correspondence is now via email.
REFUNDS
In the event of any error in your payment, please contact the BSPED office.  Refunds will be made where appropriate, at the sole discretion of the BSPED.  Refunds cannot be provided for part of the membership year if membership is cancelled.
CANCELLATION
Notification of cancellation of your membership must be made to the BSPED office and received before the start of the new membership year.
NOTE
From time to time, the terms & conditions as well as the privacy policy will be changed. The terms & conditions and privacy policy are located on the BSPED website where any updates will be reflected. No further notification of changes will be made.
