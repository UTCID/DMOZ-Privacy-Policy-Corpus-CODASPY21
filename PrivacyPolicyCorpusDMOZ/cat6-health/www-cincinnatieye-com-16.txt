Symptoms of an Eye Infection

Vision difficulties
Common Eye Infections
Two of the most typical forms of eye infections include conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, and styes.
Conjunctivitis
Conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the white part of the eyeball. It produces inflammation that affects the blood vessels and gives the eye a pink or red appearance.
Styes
Styes are small red bumps that develop along the eyelid as a result of a bacterial infection of the hair follicle of an eyelash. Styes may cause pain, swelling and tearing of the eye.
Treatment of Eye Infections
Treatment for an eye infection will vary depending on its cause. Some may go away on their own, while others will require the use of warm compresses, over-the-counter medications or antibiotic eye drops. Patients should avoid wearing makeup or contact lenses until after the infection is gone.
