MDA Disclaimer
Historically, the term Muscular Dystrophy encompasses all Muscular Dystrophies and neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Therefore, Muscular Dystrophy is also a NMD.
While the MDA provides information on a wide range of similar disorders which may have a component of muscle wasting or peripheral neuropathy, the provision of this information does not imply that the particular disorder is a neuromuscular disorder. The information is being provided as a convenience for people accessing The Home of MDA or through the provision of printed material direct from the MDA.
The MDA’s Charter is to provide support and services to people whose primary and underlying medical condition fits the category of a Neuromuscular Disorder and not where the symptoms of a disorder mimics muscle wasting or a neuropathy. A comprehensive list of NMDs covered by the MDA is listed on the website and within several brochures produced by the MDA.
The Home of MDA is strictly a news and information website about the range of disorders encompassed by the terminology – Neuromuscular Disorders and Muscular Dystrophy. This site does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. This content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your GP, neurologist, specialist or another qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding your circumstance. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this website or found via Google (or other) searches.
