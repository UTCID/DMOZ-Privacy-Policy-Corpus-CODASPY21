Privacy Policy
TPAN's Privacy PolicyTPAN respects the privacy of its donors and other visitors to its website. TPAN strongly believes that if online contributions and services to visitors are to flourish, users of our website must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, TPAN has implemented the following policy.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES TPAN COLLECT?
Most data TPAN collects are used only to help us better serve our clients. It is our general policy to collect and store only personal information that our donors and visitors knowingly provide. If our privacy policies change, we will notify all users by e-mail or a special announcement, prominently placed on the website.

TPAN does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website. Only aggregate data—such as the number of hits per page—are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.
From TPAN Donors and Positively Aware Subscribers
To contribute to TPAN’s programs, or receive copies of Positively Aware magazine, donors and subscribers may be asked to provide some limited information—including name, physical address, phone number, and e-mail address. This information, whether submitted online or offline, is submitted voluntarily.
Additionally, for some e-mails sent in HTML format by TPAN to its members, we will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that e-mail. For those e-mails, TPAN will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message.
Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: e-mail address of a user, the date and time of the user’s "click," name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number and destination page. TPAN only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members. This information is not sold or distributed in any other manner.
