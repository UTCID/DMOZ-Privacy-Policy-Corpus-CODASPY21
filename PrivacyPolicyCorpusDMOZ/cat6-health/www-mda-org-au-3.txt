Administration Policy
Muscular Dystrophy Australia (MDA) has developed and maintained
a range of client support programs and services since its inception in 1985. The
MDA’s success, as a not-for-profit organisation is attributed, in part, to the
quality of the staff, the Committee of Management (CoM), volunteers and other
interested parties who through their individual and collective input have greatly
contributed to the positive evolution of the organisation.
