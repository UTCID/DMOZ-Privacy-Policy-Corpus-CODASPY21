Privacy
Rights
SECURITY POLICY:
The Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com's policy on our
Internet site is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. The
Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com will never willfully
disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to
any third party without first receiving that customer's permission.
This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you
and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun and enjoyable
experience and we want to help you make it so.
The Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com shares information
about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other
third parties. However, in most cases, we talk about our users in aggregate,
not as individuals. For example, we will say the Self Empowerment
Center @ LightSeed.com's audience is x percent females and y percent
males. This data is used to customize the Self Empowerment Center
@ LightSeed.com content and advertising for our users.
There are cases where the Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com
may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We
do this when you register to our site or make a product or service purchase.
When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front.
This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information
or not. For example, we may want to send you product or service announcements
via e-mail or regular mail at your request. In case you change your
mind or some personal information may change (such as your billing or
shipping address), you may easily correct, update or remove the personal
data you give us by using our Edit Customer Account page.
USE OF COOKIES: Upon your first visit to the Self Empowerment
Center @ LightSeed.com, the Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com
sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies
you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data.
In no way does this tell us that you're "Bob Smith." The Self Empowerment
Center @ LightSeed.com has two primary uses for its cookies.
First, we use them
to specify unique preferences. For example, when ordering products and
services through our Web site, after your initial registration, your
preferences pertaining to shipping and billing locations are remembered
by our system. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again
where you want your products sent.
Secondly, we use
cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand
and improve areas of the Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com
Web site that our users find valuable. While both of these activities
depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to the Self Empowerment
Center @ LightSeed.com always have the option of disabling cookies
via their browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to
accept cookies.
You can reset your
browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, note that some parts of the Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com
Web site may not function properly if you refuse cookies.
The Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com's policy does not extend
to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore
beyond Self Empowerment Center @ LightSeed.com's control, and
is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental
regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to
this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
