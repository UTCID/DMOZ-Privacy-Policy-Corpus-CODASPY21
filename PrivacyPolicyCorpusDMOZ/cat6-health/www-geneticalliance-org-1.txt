Health Information Technology
Health Information Technology (HIT) is the multiple platforms on which individuals' medical and other health records are stored. Currently, patients and their healthcare providers experience difficulties accessing these records freely. Difficulties in accessing electronic health information (EHI) limit healthcare delivery efficiency and research efforts surrounding specific diseases.
Genetic Alliance supports:
Making a patient’s electronic health information (EHI) more accessible to the patient
Clear conditions/requirements for health information technology developers related to protecting data rights, privacy, and security
Health IT developers defining, developing, and making available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for access and exchange of EHI by consumers without special effort
What has Genetic Alliance done to push for improved Health Information Technology?
The “21st Century Cures Act”, signed into law in 2016, aimed to incorporate patient perspectives into the medical product development process while accelerating their release to those who need it the most.
Genetic Alliance wrote a letter suggesting possible improvements to the 21st Century Cures Act.
