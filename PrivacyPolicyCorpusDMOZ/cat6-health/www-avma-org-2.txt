Claims of Copyright Infringement
It is AVMA's policy to promptly process and investigate notices of alleged copyright infringement, and to take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512 ("DMCA"). If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated by AVMA or by a third party who has uploaded Content on one of our websites, please provide the following information to the AVMA-designated copyright agent listed below:
A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on an AVMA website;
An address, a telephone number, and an e-mail address where AVMA can contact you and, if different, an e-mail address where the alleged infringing party, if not AVMA, can contact you;
A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property rights owner, by its agent, or by law;
A statement by you under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on the owner's behalf;
Your electronic or physical signature.
AVMA may request additional information before removing any infringing or allegedly infringing material. AVMA may provide the alleged infringing party with your e-mail address so that that person can respond to your allegations.
AVMA expects all users of AVMA Services to comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if AVMA is notified of a claimed copyright infringement, or otherwise becomes aware of facts and circumstances from which infringement is apparent, it will respond appropriately, which may include removing or disabling access to the material that is claimed to be infringing. AVMA will follow the procedures outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) with regard to appropriate notifications of the user and the complaining party, acceptance of counter notifications, and, where indicated, "putback" of the alleged infringing material.
If you believe your copyright-protected material is being used on any AVMA website without permission, please notify the designated agent:

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SUCH CONTENT, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.

Choice of Law; Venue
To the maximum extent permitted by law, this Agreement, its Terms, and use of AVMA Services are governed by and will be interpreted under the laws of the State of Illinois, United States of America, without reference to conflicts of laws and without regard to the location of execution or performance of this Agreement. You hereby agree that any and all disputes which may arise and any litigation that may arise from such disputes will be litigated before a court located in the State of Illinois, County of Cook, U.S.A., to the exclusion of the courts of any other country, state or county.
General Legal Terms
Use of AVMA Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including without limitation this paragraph. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the user and AVMA with respect to AVMA Services, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and AVMA with respect to AVMA Services. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You agree that AVMA may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on AVMA Services. You agree that if AVMA does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which AVMA has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of AVMA's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to AVMA.
