About Us
Those We Help
We provide clinical care and counseling services to terminally ill patients and their families, regardless of age, financial status, or the particular illness involved.
We deliver our care and services primarily in the home. No one will be turned away from care because of inability to pay. We also work in skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and other locations in the community.
We serve patients diagnosed with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease follows its normal course, and we encourage patients, families, and the medical community to consider our hospice and palliative care services early in the planning process. The sooner we begin work, the more hardship we can alleviate and more quality of life we can bring about.
Hospice: Much more than cancer care
Many people associate hospice with cancer. Yet cancer patients represent less than half of those we serve.
Hospice care can assist with conditions related to:
Cancer
Dementia/Alzheimer’s
Heart Disease
Liver disease
Neuromuscular disease
Peripheral Vascular
Pulmonary disease
Renal conditions
Stroke
Coma
In sum, we deal with any life-limiting illness.
