Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies
We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar data collection technologies to recognize you and/or your device(s).
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.
Web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear GIFs) are another type of data collection technology. To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Are there different types of cookies?
First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt the Sites to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of the Sites. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on the Sites or to enable you to share content with others across social media platforms.
Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of the Sites during one single browser session and to help you to use the Sites more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to the Sites again and for analytical purposes.
Why do we use cookies?
We use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences and recognizing you when you visit the Sites. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you. When you visit the Sites, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your device:
Strictly necessary cookies, which are required for the operation of the Sites. Without them, for example, you would not be able to register or log in for the Sites that we offer.
Analytical/performance cookies, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors, to learn how visitors navigate the Sites and to help us to improve the way Services function.
Targeting cookies, which record your visits to the Sites, the pages you visited and the links you followed. Targeting cookies helps us and our advertising partners to deliver ads or messages that are relevant to you and your interests. We also share this information with third parties to identify and send you relevant messages.
Interaction cookies, which allow you to recommend us on social media.
What about “Do Not Track”?
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.
If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including ASTRO, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
Your Choices about Personal Information
When possible, the Sites will provide you with the means to make sure that your Member information is correct and current. You may view your name, title, address, phone number, facsimile number and email address collected from you when becoming a Member or renewing Membership by entering the MyASTRO Site (using your ASTRO website username and ASTRO website password) and then reviewing your information in the Online Membership Directory. For any other information not appearing in the Online Membership Directory, you must contact ASTRO directly in one of the four ways listed below. To correct any factual inaccuracies, you must send ASTRO a request that shows the error and the requested change. Certain types of information, such as, but not limited to, information provided in response to surveys, financial information kept for accounting purposes and accreditation and self-assessment information (both for surveyors and facilities) that have been submitted for review, may not be able to be edited, updated or corrected.
ASTRO will make a good faith effort to process valid changes, but ASTRO does not promise to do so within a particular time frame. ASTRO will send you a confirmation email once a change is effected.
Members may opt-out of listing any information beyond their name and company in the Member Directory through the ROhub.
