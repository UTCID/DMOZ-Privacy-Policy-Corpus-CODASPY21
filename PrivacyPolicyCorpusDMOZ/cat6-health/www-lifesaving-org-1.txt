Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
The Society's privacy policy provides Leadership Volunteers with the guidelines for professional behavior in reference to the privacy of Society members, award holders, and candidates.
The Lifesaving Society's privacy principles reflect those within PIPA, PIPEDA, and FOIPP legislation. Lifesaving Society Affiliates and Leadership Volunteers need to be aware of these guidelines.
It is necessary to collect, record, and retain personal information of candidates including name, address, phone number, date of birth, and results data. This information is used by the Society for Member Services such as award processing. This personal information belongs to the Lifesaving Society and must not be shared with any other persons or organizations. It is not acceptable to provide a copy of the completed test sheet to a candidate if it also contains the personal information of other candidates. It is not acceptable to share the results of Society exams with any affiliate except the affiliate hosting the exam. The affiliate is responsible for collecting the exam results and sending them to the Society.
The Code of Conduct for Leadership Volunteers specifically requires that confidentiality of personal information be maintained. It is important that all parties involved act to protect the confidentiality and privacy of our members.
