Lupus
At Allegheny Health Network (AHN), our team has been studying lupus for decades. While it is difficult to diagnose, we’ll help get you the right diagnosis quickly, so you can start treatment sooner.
We provide comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services at nine outpatient rheumatology practices throughout the tri-state area. And, at our Autoimmunity Institute, located at West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield, you can receive care from a variety of autoimmune specialists. World-class lupus care, close to home, has never been easier.
What is lupus?
Lupus is a type of autoimmune rheumatic disease. If you have autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy tissues it sees as a threat. When you have lupus, your immune system attacks healthy muscle or joint tissues.
Rheumatologists care for people with lupus. Rheumatologists are physicians who receive extensive training in diagnosing and treating complex conditions like lupus.
Lupus is chronic, meaning it affects your body long term. Lupus most often causes pain and inflammation in your joints and muscles. It can also affect the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, and other body systems.
Our Lupus Center of Excellence
At AHN, some of our rheumatologists have been studying lupus for more than 30 years. They’ve seen firsthand how this condition affects people and which treatments are effective. Their experience helps us diagnose and treat even the most complex cases.
If you have lupus, our physicians will provide a treatment plan focused on relieving your symptoms. To do this, we use the latest treatments, including medications and infusion therapies, to help you feel and function better.
Our team also participates in research and clinical trials to advance lupus care. Our lupus specialists are known around the world for studying the causes of premature heart disease in women with lupus. This research has led to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies to help women manage (or avoid) this rare complication.
Our physicians helped develop a specialized blood test that improves lupus diagnosis as well. These research efforts give patients access to the most effective therapies often before they’re widely available.
