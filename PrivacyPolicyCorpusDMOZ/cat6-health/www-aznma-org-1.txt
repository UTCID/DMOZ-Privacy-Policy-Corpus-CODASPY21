The use of this members-only portion of the AzNMA web site constitutes agreement with the following additional terms and conditions:
The AzNMA maintains this portion of the web site (the “Members’ Site”) as a courtesy to those members of the AzNMA who may choose to access the Members’ Site (“Users”). The information presented herein is for informative purposes only. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the findings, interpretations and conclusions expressed in the materials on this Members’ Site are those of the various authors who prepared the work and do not necessarily represent the views of the AzNMA.
This Members’ Site is intended for use by licensed naturopathic physicians only. Users are responsible for their own decisions on diagnosis, treatment and follow up for a patient, or from choosing or not choosing specific treatments based on the posted publications. The content is not intended to diagnose patients or recommend therapy. Users should be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Because of this fact and because of regular advances in medical research and the possibility of human error, Users should independently verify specified diagnosis methods, evidence, treatments, follow up and any contraindications or side effects, including whether a particular diagnosis, evidence, treatment or other follow up is generally appropriate, whether it is up to date and whether it is suitable for a particular patient. The content is no substitute for individual patient assessment based upon the User's examination of each patient and consideration of laboratory data and other factors unique to the patient.
Users should use their professional judgment in using the posted publications, which is done at their own risk. AzNMA relies on its authors to confirm the accuracy of the information presented and does not independently verify any of the information. Please also note that information is not warranted to be accurate and may be out of date. Ultimately it is the User’s responsibility to make his or her own professional judgments, so as to appropriately advise and treat his or her patients.
