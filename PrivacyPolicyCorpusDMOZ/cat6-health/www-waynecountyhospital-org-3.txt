Smoke and Tobacco Free Policy>
As a provider of health care, the Wayne County Hospital and Clinics have a responsibility to promote a healthy environment. We are committed to providing a smoke-free and tobacco-free campus for all WCH employees, medical staff, students, volunteers, patients and visitors both inside and outside of our facilities. Smoking and second-hand smoke is widely recognized as the single most important cause of preventable human disease including lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema.
Breathe Easier
Ask your provider to help you learn more about smoking cessation resources and how to obtain nicotine replacement products (e.g. lozenges, gum and patches).
Smoking Cessation Resources and Information
The American Heart Association and others provide helpful information on the dangers of second hand smoke and the connection to cardiovascular-related disability.
