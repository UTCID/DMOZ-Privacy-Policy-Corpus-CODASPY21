Primary Biliary Cholangitis Organization (formerly known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Organization) AKA PBCers Organization.
About the PBCers Organization
The PBCers Organization is a tax exempt public charity under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code as an organization described in section 501 (c) (3). One-hundred percent (100%) of all donations received are donated to PBC education or research, whichever fund is specified by the donor. PBCers Organization overhead expenses and many of the project/events are covered by corporate grants
The PBCers Organization is an online organization that works mainly through personal and committee e-mail, Yahoo Groups and telephone calls when needed. Members of the executive committee maintain the PBCers internet website (pbcers.org), Facebook pages, Twitter and e-mail PBC Daily Digest. We also organize fundraising projects, fun-runs/walks, educational meetings, National PBC patient conferences and other advocacy projects we feel are helpful to our organization and members.
The PBCers Organization is operated and maintained by volunteers. There are “no” paid board directors, committee members, moderators or other volunteers. The day-to-day operations are handled by the executive committee and moderators.
Ethics Policy
It is the policy of the PBCers Organization that its board directors, committee members, moderators and volunteers uphold the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior, and they shall dedicate themselves to carrying out the mission of this organization. We shall act in such a manner as to uphold and enhance personal and professional honor and integrity. Treat with respect and consideration all persons, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital or family status, disability, age or national origin.
Collaborate with and support other PBC groups and medical professionals in carrying out the PBCers Organizations’ mission. Build a professional reputation on the merit of services and refrain from competing unfairly with others. Recognize that the chief function of the PBCers Organization at all times is to serve the best interests of its membership
Volunteer Recruitment
PBCers Organization’s volunteers are recruited through the PBC Daily Digest, Facebook private groups, referral by other volunteers, and some offer their assistance. For events we recruit local volunteers if possible, to avoid the high cost of travel expenses. Many of our volunteers are long term organization members who not only help with projects and events, but also help train new volunteers.
Volunteer Training
Volunteers are trained by one of the executive committee members or project chair. This is done prior to the project/event or in person at the event. We also have electronic training booklets on some project/events such as PBC national conferences. Most of our events are the type that require greetings and handing out materials, so training is minimal.
Dress Code
Volunteers are representatives of the PBCers Organization and are responsible for presenting a positive image to the community.  Volunteers will be informed of the dress standard for their duties at the time of assignment or prior to.
Attendance and Time
Volunteer attendance is important to the operation of each program. Volunteers should notify their committee chair person in advance if they are unable to be present on their scheduled day or presentation. Volunteers are responsible for completing and submitting their volunteer time through the end of the project.
The Making of Statements
No volunteer shall use PBCers Organization stationery or any title of PBCers Organization unless on a specific committee. Most volunteers will wear a PBCers Organization nametag
Record Management
The PBCers Organization maintains accounting records. As a nonprofit charity our accounting records are open to the public.
Our organization also maintains records on each volunteer throughout the organization. Records include dates of volunteer service, positions held, duties performed, and awards/recognitions received.
It is the policy of the PBCers Organization that Board Directors, Executive Committee members, moderators and other volunteers of the PBCers Organization may not disclose, divulge, or make accessible confidential information belonging to, or obtained through their affiliation with the PBCers Organization to any person, including relatives, friends, and business and professional associates, other than to persons who have a legitimate need for such information and to whom the PBCers Organization has authorized disclosure.
Volunteers shall use confidential information solely for the purpose of performing services as a volunteer for the PBCers Organization. This policy is not intended to prevent disclosure where disclosure is required by law. Volunteers are responsible for submitting and updating their information contained in the PBCers Organization’s files such as e-mail address, phone number and mailing address.
Reimbursement of Expenses
The PBCers Organization recognizes that volunteers may be required to travel or incur expenses from time to time to conduct business and further the mission of our organization. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that (a) adequate cost controls are in place, (b) travel and other expenditures are appropriate, and (c) to provide a uniform and consistent approach for the timely reimbursement of authorized expenses incurred. It is the policy of the PBCers Organization to reimburse only reasonable and necessary expenses actually incurred.
All expenses prior to being incurred, must be approved by the Executive Committee or the Conference Committee Chairperson, whichever applies. Volunteers must submit the request in the form of e-mail to Linie Moore at (pbcers@pbcers.org), explaining the expense/s and requesting approval.
Reimbursement for travel to and from volunteer service by personal motor vehicle is based on mileage and the standard rate per mile according to the IRS allowed mileage rate. Parking and tolls may also be reimbursable.
Reimbursement for travel to and from volunteer service by public transportation (air, bus, train, boat, taxi, shuttle, ferry, etc.) is based on actual out-of-pocket expense which must be substantiated by receipts. In some cases, meals and miscellaneous expenses may be reimbursed for out-of-town travel and/or all day events.
PBCers Organization expense report needs to be submitted within two weeks of incurring the expense. Expense reports can be submitted through e-mail to PBCers@pbcers.org or US Postal mail PBCers Organization, 1014-A Greenleaf Road, Rochester, NY 14612.
Receipts are required for all expenditures, no matter what the amount. There will be no reimbursement without original receipt/s and expense report.
Return of Property
Volunteers are responsible for PBCers Organization’s property which includes materials, files, keys, passwords and any other written or electronic information issued to or in volunteers’ possession or control. All PBCers Organization property must be returned on or before the last day of project.
Discrimination and Sexual Harassment
PBCers Organization is committed to providing volunteers with an environment that is free from discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. PBCers Organization encourages volunteers to bring any incidents of sexual harassment to the immediate attention to their Project or Committee Chairperson.
The PBCers Organization will not in any way retaliate against an individual who makes a report of discrimination or sexual harassment. An investigation of the alleged discrimination or harassment will be handled through the Executive Committee in a confidential manner so as to protect the privacy of the persons involved. Upon completion of the discrimination and harassment investigation the Executive Committee will recommend the appropriate action to be taken. In the event the complaint cannot be substantiated, this finding will be communicated to the complainant in an appropriately sensitive manner.If the complaint is against an Executive Committee member, the investigation will be handled by the Board Directors.
Conflict of Interest
In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the tax-exempt Primary Biliary Cholangitis Organization (PBCers Organization) interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of a board director, committee member, moderator or other volunteer of the PBCers Organization or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.
Accepting Payment or Gifts: No volunteer shall accept payment of any kind (including gifts, cash, discounts, concessions, services or other similar item or benefits) for services rendered as part of his or her volunteer service. This includes payment for speaking engagements or for participation in workshops or similar activities.
Improper Influence: Any volunteer, or close relative, should not, when acting on his or her own behalf or when acting on behalf of another person, business or organization, attempt to influence PBCers Organization’s position on any issue, matter or transaction nor participate in any discussions pertaining to a related organization.
Competing with PBCers Organization: No volunteer shall prevent or hinder PBCers Organization from lawfully competing with others or divert business from PBCers Organization.
Conflict of Interest Decision: The PBCers Organization’s Broad of Directors will make the decision if a Conflict of Interest is occurring or occurred.
Political Activities
Volunteers are encouraged to take an active interest and to participate in the political and governmental process. However, except for registered lobbyists and others authorized to act on behalf of PBCers Organization, volunteers participating do so as individuals and not as representatives of PBCers Organization. To avoid any inference of support or sponsorship by PBCers Organization, a volunteer must never represent that his or her political donation, endorsement or other political activity was made or engaged in with the approval, or on behalf, of PBCers Organization. Likewise, volunteers must not engage in political activities during their volunteer service on behalf of PBCers Organization.
Whistle Blower Policy
In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if any board director, committee member, or other volunteer reasonably believes that some policy, practice, or activity of the PBCers Organization is in violation of law, a written complaint must be filed by that person with the Executive Committee and or the Board President.
It is the intent of the PBCers Organization to adhere to all laws and regulations that apply to the organization and the underlying purpose of this policy is to support the organization’s goal of legal compliance. The support of all the volunteers is necessary to achieving compliance with various laws and regulations..
PBC Local Groups
The goals of local groups are to meet face-to-face with other PBC patients, share information and personal experiences, raise funds for research, promote PBC awareness and build friendships with others who share the same disease.
Local meeting information listed on our website has been submitted to the PBCers Organization by the local group’s organizer/s. The local group listings are published for information purposes only. The local group organizer should be contacted if additional group information is needed. The only local meetings we are aware of are the ones listed on our website.

This includes, but is not limited to, local group’s contact information published, meeting expenses, activities and location, local event fundraisers, and or any other events associated with local groups.
