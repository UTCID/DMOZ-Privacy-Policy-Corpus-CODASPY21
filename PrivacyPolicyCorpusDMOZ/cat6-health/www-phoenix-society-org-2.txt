Terms of UseTerms of UseThe Phoenix Society Online Community is not intended for use by individuals under 13 years of age in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
Overview
Welcome to https://phoenix-society.org, an extension of Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, Inc, a non-profit, 501c3 organization. We maintain this Web site as a service to our constituents. Any reference to phoenix-society.org applies to any and all offerings happening by extension of phoenix-society.org. This website is provided solely for the use of current and future constituents of the Phoenix-Society.org to provide you with information about our organization, find resources and support, and to enable you to contact us with any questions or comments you may have. Any other use of this site is prohibited.
By using our Web site, whether as an enrolled user or otherwise, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms of use. Please review the following terms carefully. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not review information or utilize the services provided by Phoenix-Society.org.
The goal of the Phoenix Society's Online Community is to provide a secure and safe place for you to share your story, while also providing a place to connect with others who have similar experiences related to a burn trauma. The community is not meant to take the place of or to provide counseling, psychotherapy or medical advice but rather is meant to provide a place to learn from one another and gain peer support so you may move forward in your healing process.
Some of the areas are interactive while others will provide a place to read and learn from others' stories. We encourage you to create a profile and join our online community.
Often we are sharing information, experiences, and coping strategies that are very emotional and self-disclosing. To provide a safe place for the members of this community the following participation guidelines will be utilized, similar to self-help groups that happen face-to-face.
As with any group, connections will be made, friendships may form, and some people may want to discuss issues and life problems unrelated to burn injury issues. These discussions need to occur outside of the online group setting in order that this site be kept available for the purpose intended by the Phoenix Society, namely help and support in dealing with burn-related issues.
Your safety is important to us. However, the prohibited uses of this website notwithstanding, there is no verification of users’ identity used to create profiles on this site. As with any personal connection, common sense must be used. You expressly agree that a decision to make a personal connection is at your sole risk.
Participation Guidelines:
No vulgarities, obscenities, name-calling, character assassinations or mockery are allowed.
No personal attacks or flaming of any kind. You may respectfully disagree with a member, but calling them names or flaming their character is not allowed.
Posting links to offensive material is not allowed under any circumstances.
Asterisking out curse words in order to get your point across is not an acceptable way to bypass moderating of offensive words. Please share your thoughts, opinions and feelings in a way that doesn’t require the use of curse words.
Feelings are not to be judged, they are neither right nor wrong - they just are.
Allow people to have the space for their true feelings.
No judgment of other people's sharings (even positive comments evaluate sharing).
We do not need to fix people’s pain (hurt, anger, fear, sadness, despair) - going through the feelings is how we heal and recover from loss and change.
It is helpful to offer caring, support and suggestions about how you got through a similar rough spot in the road.
It is not okay to try to talk people out of their feelings or to discount feelings in any way.
Under no circumstances will any soliciting be allowed.
There are many ways to express spirituality and this is a very personal and individual choice. It is not all right to use this site as a forum to promote your own spiritual or religious beliefs.
The group is not a place to promote organizations, causes or solicit funds. (if you would like to provide information on resources that have assisted you in your recovery that is okay).
A link to other resources is available on the Resources page of this site, as we are committed to sharing quality resources to burn survivors and their families.
The group is a safe and helpful place because it allows a space for people's true feelings to be shared without judgment, criticism, discounting or fixing.
Note: It is important to remember safety while online. Always use caution when providing any personal information about yourself anywhere online. It's also a good rule-of-thumb to check the Privacy Policies of any unfamiliar or new web sites you visit. When communicating in a chat room be mindful that many people will be able to view it and the inclusion of information such as your name, your address or telephone number is never recommended.

Chat Policy and Transcripts
All participants of the Phoenix Society online peer support chat agree to abide by the above stated participation guidelines and the terms set forth in this “terms of use” agreement.
The Phoenix Society offers chat participation to anyone over the age of 13 affected by a burn injury.
To assure that chat remains a beneficial tool for the burn community, a transcript of each chat session is maintained at the Phoenix Society office (525 Ottawa Ave NW Front, Grand Rapids, MI 49503).
The information within the transcripts is reviewed by the Phoenix Society staff and used to compile statistics about usage, provide better service to all patrons, train and monitor moderators, analyze the amount and types of questions being asked so as to schedule future speakers and topics, and to monitor the quality of the chatroom service.
The information collected is only accessible to the Phoenix Society staff.
In accordance with our Privacy Policy, it is not our policy to release or sell your personal information.
Portions of the transcript may be used when necessary in documenting reasons for booting or banning a disruptive user from the chat service. Additionally, we sometimes are required by court orders or other laws to divulge information to law enforcement authorities, to government agencies or to the court.
