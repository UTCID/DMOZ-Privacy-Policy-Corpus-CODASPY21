COVID-19 Updates
COVID-19 InformationIf you feel sick with fever, cough or shortness of breath and have recently been in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19, or if you live in or have recently traveled to an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, call your primary care doctor. Your health care professionals will work with your local public health department to determine if you need to be tested. Symptoms may appear 2 – 14 days after exposure. If you have questions, the Ohio Department of Health has set up a call center at 1-833-4-ASK-ODH (1-833-427-5634). The ODH call center is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. – 8 p.m. and is staffed by licensed nurses and infectious disease experts who can help you determine the appropriate next steps.Click the buttons below for more information:

For a quick, easy-to-follow guide to help you make decisions and seek appropriate medical care, please click here for more information.
+ Visitation Restrictions
Due to the recent increase in positive COVID-19 cases in the community, Aultman is temporarily implementing new visitation restrictions across the Healthcare Delivery System until further notice. Effective immediately:
Visitors will no longer be permitted to visit patients in any inpatient unit, with the exception of end-of-life situations.
Maternity patients will be permitted one visitor or caregiver per patient.
Outpatients, including Emergency Department patients, will be permitted one visitor or caregiver only if needed for assistance.
Surgical patients will be permitted one visitor or caregiver to remain with the patient.
Pediatric patients will be permitted two parents or caregivers per patient.
We will also be limiting which entrances visitors can use to access our facilities and when. Access to our hospitals via the Emergency Department entrance is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.These visitation restrictions apply at all Aultman facilities and emergency departments, with the exception of post-acute services at Aultman Woodlawn, the Compassionate Care Center, the Community Care Center in Alliance and the Senior Care Behavioral Health Unit. Visitors will NOT be permitted to access any Aultman nursing care facilities, including the Aultman Woodlawn campus and the Community Care Center in Alliance.Any person who enters an Aultman facility will be required to wear a cloth face covering or face mask that covers the nose and mouth. If a patient is unable to tolerate a mask, staff will wear eye protection when interacting with that patient. If an individual does not have their own mask, our screening teams, located at each entrance, will provide them with a dust mask and education on the appropriate use of the mask. Click here for more information on the latest steps we've taken to protect our patients and staff. If you have additional questions about Aultman’s response to coronavirus, we have established a phone line which is available now and will continue to be available seven days a week from 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. The phone number is 330-363-0205.Please keep in mind that we are limiting points of access at all Aultman facilities at this time:Aultman Hospital

Clergy Visitation
There will be no in-person clergy visitation for patients who have tested positive or are under investigation for COVID-19, but clergy are encouraged to use Microsoft Teams or FaceTime for those patients.
One clergy member may be permitted to visit or administer religious services to non-COVID-19 patients during reasonable designated times if all other options have been exhausted. Clergy visitation may be allowed at other times for surgical, emergency and end-of-life situations with prior approval from the hospital's incident commander/COVID-19 entity leader.
Clergy must obtain approval for each patient they intend to visit. Once approved, hospital chaplains will notify entrance screeners at the patient's location. Like all other visitors, the clergy must pass the screening process in order to enter.
Clergy members must wear appropriate PPE and practice social distancing. They will not be permitted to go room to room when visiting approved patients.
Pastoral care services are available at each Aultman campus to support and attend to our patients' diverse spiritual needs. If a patient requests clergy visitation, please reach out to pastoral care services to arrange it.
+ Elective Surgeries
With COVID hospitalizations continuing to reach new heights during the recent surge, Aultman Health Foundation will be evaluating surgery options on a week-by-week basis based on hospital occupancy and COVID admissions to allow us to make the best use of resources and provide the highest-quality care.At this time, Aultman main campus will be suspending elective procedures requiring an overnight stay. Aultman Orrville and Aultman Alliance will continue to offer elective inpatient procedures. This may change in the weeks ahead as we continue to evaluate our occupancy and admissions. Urgent, emergency and outpatient procedures will continue to be available. If you have any questions, contact your doctor for additional information.
+ AMG COVID-19 Visitation Policy
Aultman Medical Group is asking all patients with upcoming appointments who are experiencing cough, fever, sore throat or shortness of breath to please notify their provider’s office before arriving for their appointments. Additionally, if you have recently been in close contact with someone known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled to an area with an ongoing spread of COVID-19, please contact the office in advance. Out of an abundance of caution to provide a greater degree of protection against the spread of COVID-19, we ask that all patients with previously scheduled appointments at an Aultman Medical Group practice arrive at their appointment unaccompanied. If necessary, one support person is permitted to escort each patient to their appointment on an as-needed basis.
+ Dining & Donations
At Aultman Hospital main campus, we have reduced our stations at the cafeteria, Seasons Café and Express Mart to eliminate any self-serve items. For the safety of the community, if you do choose to eat in Seasons Café or the cafeteria, please do not rearrange tables or chairs. This will ensure proper six foot distancing for all guests.
At Aultman Alliance Community Hospital, the Café is not offering self-service stations and is encouraging to-go dining.
At Aultman Orrville Hospital, the cafeteria is not offering self-service stations and is encouraging to-go dining. For the safety of the community, if you do choose to eat in the AOH cafeteria, please do not rearrange tables or chairs. This will ensure proper six foot social distancing for all guests.
FOOD DONATIONSOur healing heroes are so grateful for your generous food donations! Please keep in mind that we can only accept food that has been prepared in a commercial kitchen and we prefer food that is individually packaged so we can share it safely with our team members.

PPECOVID-19 has caused a national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Aultman facilities are quickly running out of this critical safety equipment, which is needed to protect our staff on the front line. We are asking members of our community to consider donating any PPE they may have available in an effort to help protect our nurses and health care workers. For a list of specific items Aultman is accepting or for contact information to arrange pickup/delivery, please click here.
