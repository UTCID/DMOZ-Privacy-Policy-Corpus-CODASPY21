News Media and Commercial Filming Policy
News and Commercial Filming PolicyBurke Rehabilitation Hospital's Marketing Department is the main liaison with the news media and commercial production companies. To protect the integrity of the Burke brand as well as the privacy and confidentiality of all Burke patients, families and staff, a member of the marketing department will accompany all reporters, video crews and photographers while on campus. This policy is broken down in to two parts. One addresses the procedures for news media and the other addresses the procedures for commercial production companies and film crews. The policies and corresponding forms are available for download in the informational boxes to the right.
Please Note: Only exteriors of the Burke campus may be used for commercial filming. In rare instances, interiors of other campus buildings can be used for filming upon the Marketing department’s approval. Initial outreach must be done at least one month prior to film date.
For more information, please contact a member of Marketing department at (914) 597-2848 or via email at externalrelations@burke.org

Over the years, Burke Rehabilitation Hospital's campus has been the backdrop for television and film projects. The 61-acre manicured grounds that include its original neoclassic buildings and graceful colonnades designed by the famed architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, have found their way into both modern day and period productions.
Today, the campus is regularly visited by film location scouts, architecture buffs, historians and students. It remains a wonderful example of post-Victorian architecture, seemingly untouched from when Burke opened its doors nearly 100 years ago.
