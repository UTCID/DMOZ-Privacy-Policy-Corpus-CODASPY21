Your privacy is important to me. I hate spam and unsolicited email just as much as you do.
This page explains my online information gathering practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Information usage
I use the information you provide about yourself specifically to process your request and/or answer your question(s). Your information is never shared with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your request.
Your personal information will never be shared in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. I will never trade, sell, or otherwise misuse your personal information — that is my absolute promise to you.
How to reach me
Should you have any questions or concerns about your privacy in regards to this website and my work as a legal consultant, please feel free to contact me.
