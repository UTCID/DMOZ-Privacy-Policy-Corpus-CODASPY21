Collectively, the Websites and Apps are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services.”
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.
This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the Services and the information provided by and obtained from users of the Services.
