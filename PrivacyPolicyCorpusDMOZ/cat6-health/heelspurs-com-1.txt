Copyright Notice
Copyright © 1996-20014 heelspurs.com
When information is posted to heelspurs.com by visitors, the submit buttons state the poster agrees that the post becomes the sole property of heelspurs.com. Documents written and pictures provided by heelspurs.com and messages posted by visitors may be printed only for personal use.

Privacy Statement
Email addresses are not used for junk email purposes by heelspurs.com and are not sold to third parties.
Only the newsletter recipients may be subject to advertising. Only if heelspurs.com is acquired by another company, will the email addresses become acquired by another company, which will be required to keep the agreement heelspurs.com
had with those who supplied their email addresses.
As with all other web sites, if an email address is posted to a message board, guestbook, or any of the other public databases at heelspurs.com (such as the surgery, ESWT, and doctor rating databases), email addresses that are thereby displayed in public on heelspurs.com web pages may be gathered against heelspurs.com's wishes and used for spamming purposes. Email addresses are never required by heelspurs.com to use any of its services (except of course for the email newsletters).
As a service to visitors, if the "view messages since your last visit" link in the message board area is clicked, a cookie records the number of the last message that was posted.
The next time the link is clicked, the cookie is read and rewritten with the new number so that the user will be able to view only the messages since the last time the link was clicked. Another cookie records the name
for message board posts so that users do not have to type their information for future posts. Another cookie is used to keep track of when a purchase is made and a number is assigned to that purchase. Some people consider cookies a privacy risk because they record on the user's computer when and where the cookie was used and the data it collected.
Other internet sites are not supposed to be able to access this data.
Other users of the same computer are able to view the cookies used (and thereby know when and where the other users of the computer have been and the data collected) unless the cookie files are deleted.
As noted above, heelspurs.com cookies do not store sensitive information and should not present a security or privacy risk.
heelspurs.com reserves the right to change the privacy policy from time to time. A revised policy will apply to information collected after the date the policy is changed.
