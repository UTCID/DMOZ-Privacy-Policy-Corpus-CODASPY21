Crawford & Company EU Privacy Notice
Last Updated: August 1, 2020
Who we areCrawford & Company is a global, independent provider of claims management solutions, providing integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services worldwide to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities. We are committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information we collect and providing clear information about how we handle personal information. We encourage you to read this Notice carefully so that you understand how we treat your personal information and what rights you may have.Scope of this privacy noticeYour privacy is important to us. We have developed this EU Privacy Notice (the “EU Privacy Notice” or the “Notice”) to provide information about how the Crawford & Company Group handles personal information that is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation as well as associated European Union/European Economic Area (“EEA”) national laws (collectively, in this Notice the “GDPR”).This EU Privacy Notice explains how Crawford & Company and its affiliated and subsidiary companies (together, “Crawford”, “we”, “us” or “our”) handle the personal information that is subject to the GDPR, which we collect about individuals:that use our websites and associated serviceswho are our former, current and prospective clientswho communicate with us who otherwise use our products or engage with us regarding our loss adjusting, third party claims administration and other claims management and related services (our “Services”) other individuals whose personal information we receive in providing the ServicesThis EU Privacy Notice is intended to disclose the personal information that we collect from these individuals subject to the GDPR, and to explain how we use and disclose this personal information, as well as the choices and rights individuals have regarding this personal information. This Notice does not apply to the personal information that we process about current and former employees, which is subject to different respective employee privacy notices. This EU Privacy Notice also does not cover any third-party websites or services.Crawford’s Online Privacy Policy: For users outside the EU, the Crawford Online Privacy Policy, available here, applies to all users of our relevant websites, associated pages and online services.For the purposes of the GDPR, and unless you are explicitly notified otherwise, Crawford & Company International, Inc. is the controller of your personal information, and where the processing of personal information is also undertaken by other Crawford Group companies with whom you engage, they are joint controllers with Crawford & Company International, Inc. for your personal information. See the “Questions, Concerns and Contact Details” section below for a list of relevant Crawford Group controllers and their locations, as well as details on how to contact Crawford or exercise your rights with respect to your personal information.Client claims dataOur primary business is to provide claims management and related services globally – including third party claims administrator services, loss adjusting and associated risk, consulting and other services. Generally, we provide these services to entities that provide coverage, issue or underwrite the policies or are otherwise responsible for payment of the claims that we handle. We refer to these entities as “insurers” which broadly includes insurance companies, brokers, agents, underwriters, self-insured entities and other entities that issue or underwrite policies, provide coverage for or otherwise make decisions regarding the claims we handle. As a part of our claims management services, we process claims and handle administrative functions for insurers, such as receiving notices of claims, administering forms and documentation requests and proving support-related services to policy holders and claimants. We also help insurers evaluate, assess and establish their liability for claims and make recommendations related to the settlement of claims, including payments, repairs and replacements. We process personal information during the course of providing our claims management activities to insurers. Our respective clients – the insurers - are data controllers of the claims data that we process on their behalf and our processing of personal information is subject to the instructions of our respective clients – not this EU Privacy Notice. While our role depends upon the relevant circumstances, Crawford is generally a data processor of the personal information that we process in the course of providing our claims handling services to insurers; we only process such personal information on behalf of and under the instruction of our clients or where otherwise required by EU data protection law. In the event we process claims-related data as a data controller, our activities will be subject to a separate privacy notice that is available here.Information we collectWe may collect personal information directly from you, such as when you register for news and information, contact us online or submit forms through the Sites. We may also collect personal information from third parties and automatically through your use of the Sites and Services. In this Notice, “personal information” means any information that identifies or could be used to identify an individual person. Where the personal information we collect is needed to comply with law, or to enter into or perform an agreement with you, we will inform you accordingly at the time of collection. If you decline to provide us any required personal information, we may be unable to provide products or services to you.
