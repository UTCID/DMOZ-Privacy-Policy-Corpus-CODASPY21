Gastroparesis
Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal movement of the muscles in the stomach. Usually, strong contractions move food through the digestive tract, but for those with gastroparesis, this process is slowed down or doesn’t work at all. This prevents the stomach from emptying properly. Gastroparesis can be caused by certain medications or underlying medical conditions.
Tests and diagnosis
Barium swallow study allows X-rays to be taken while a patient drinks a white chalky liquid to visualize the passage of the fluid through the esophagus and into the stomach.
High resolution manometry measures the strength, pressure and coordination of your esophagus' muscles. A specially trained nurse guides a small catheter through your nose and into the esophagus and instructs you to swallow small amounts of liquid at specific intervals.
Smart Pill is a small electronic device that is swallowed. It sends back information about how fast it is traveling as it moves through the digestive system.
Sedated traditional endoscopy uses a flexible tube with a light and camera to visually inspect your esophagus, stomach, and part of the small intestine. The camera is passed into the digestive tract through your mouth.
Treatments
Nutritional counseling is used to improve your nutritional status, including healthy weight management, pre- and post-operative diet management (including tube-feeding management) and food allergy management.
Personalized treatment options includes medications, endoscopic swallowing therapy and minimally invasive endoscopic surgery, based on the specific pathology.
