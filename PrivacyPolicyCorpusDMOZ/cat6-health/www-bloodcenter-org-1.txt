URGENT NEED FOR VOLUNTEER DONORS - Locally and nationally, blood centers have only 2-3 day supply of type O red blood cells. Supplies of AB plasma and Convalescent Plasma are depleted. We are calling for all healthy members of the public to step up now and support care for patients. Blood donation is safe and essential!  Recent changes to donor eligibility criteria will permit donations by many donors previously deferred. Questions about eligibility? Please fill out the deferral/eligibility inquiry form.
