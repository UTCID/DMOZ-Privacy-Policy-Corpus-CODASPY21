Benign Brain Tumors
A benign brain tumor is not cancerous, so it is unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. However, it may still pose a threat to your health if it presses on important structures or causes painful headaches or other debilitating symptoms.
At Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Neuroscience Institute, our surgeons are known around the world for their expertise in treating brain tumors. Using personalized treatment plans and innovative surgeries, we help provide patients significant symptom relief so they can return to their daily activities.
Types of benign brain tumors we treat
A benign brain tumor is a noncancerous mass that develops inside the brain. At AHN, our physicians expertly diagnose and treat many types of benign brain tumors, as well as skull base tumors (tumors that grow at the base of the brain):
Acoustic neuroma
Arachnoid cyst
Chordoma
Colloid cyst
Dermoid and epidermoid tumor
Glomus jugulare tumor
Hemangioblastoma
Meningioma
Pineocytoma
Vestibular schwannoma
Benign brain tumor symptoms
A benign brain tumor can cause a wide range of symptoms, or no symptoms at all, depending on its characteristics and location.
The symptoms of benign brain tumors are similar to those of malignant brain tumors. They include:
Headaches
Seizures
Changes in vision, smell, and hearing
Personality or memory changes
Motor and balance problems
Nausea or vomiting
Fatigue
Diagnosing benign brain tumors
Our brain tumor specialists expertly diagnose a range of brain tumors. Physicians often diagnose brain tumors through advanced imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which give physicians important details about a tumor’s size and location.
If your physician suspects a tumor may be cancerous, you may need to undergo further testing. AHN’s world-class cancer specialists ensure you receive a precise diagnosis and the most effective treatment.

Get comprehensive brain tumor treatment at AHN
At AHN, physicians from different specialties work together to confirm a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your symptoms and circumstances. Our care team considers your age, overall health, and other factors when deciding which treatments will benefit you.
Your treatment plan may include one or more treatments, including:
Radiation therapy: With advanced computer software and imaging technology, our radiation oncologists deliver high-dose radiation beams directly to a tumor, while protecting surrounding healthy tissue. We have the country’s largest – and western Pennsylvania’s only – radiation oncology network, accredited by top radiation oncology accrediting organizations.
Surgery: Our neurosurgeons remove brain tumor tissue while protecting surrounding healthy tissue, so you retain more mental and physical abilities after surgery. We use minimally invasive techniques to perform safe, effective surgeries. These intricate procedures enable surgeons to remove more of the tumor while resulting in a shorter hospital stay and recovery for patients. Learn more about our minimally invasive approach to brain surgery.
