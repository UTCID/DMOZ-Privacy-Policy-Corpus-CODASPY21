Did you know?
The hair you see is not all the hair you have. Hair grows in cycles. That's why it takes more than one appointment to permanently clear an area.
Your desire to change must be greater than your desire to stay the same.
Electrolysis Tip
Clean skin releases unwanted hair more easily. Remove your makeup before your appointment, so the hair follicles are clean and accessible.
Did you know?
If your electrologist can't see the hairs, they can't zap the hairs. Plucking, waxing, threading, or tweezing before your hair removal appointment reduces the number of hairs your electrologist can remove.
Do something today that your future self will thank you for.
Electrolysis Tip
Ask your electrologist for aftercare advice. They can recommend the product that is right for your skin and treatment program.
Electrolysis Tip
Schedule your haircut for after your appointment. A haircut leaves tiny "decoy" hairs all over your face!
Did you know?
Gently exfoliating your skin before your treatment opens up the follicles and lets the unwanted hair slide out more easily.
Did you Know?
Electrology is the only hair removal method recognized as permanent by the FDA.
Electrolysis Tip
For a more comfortable treatment,
avoid caffeine for a few hours before your appointment.
