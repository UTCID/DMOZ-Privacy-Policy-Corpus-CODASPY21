Hip Pain
Hip pain can make it difficult to get comfortable, even when you’re sitting. At Allegheny Health Network (AHN), we work with you to find the treatment solution that is right for you – whether it’s medication or a minimally invasive, same-day hip replacement surgery. Together, we help you get up and moving again.
Hip pain care at Allegheny Health Network: Why choose us?
We treat thousands of people each year, translating to an exceptional level of care. Our physicians and physical therapists tailor treatments based on your medical needs and activity level. If you enjoy sports, we do everything possible to minimize your time away from the game and help you make a safe return. Learn more about sports medicine and sports performance.
When surgery is necessary, you can breathe a little easier knowing you’ll be back in the swing of things in no time. We were the first program in western Pennsylvania using new Mako™ robotic technology to perform hip replacement surgery through small incisions. Many patients walk without pain within hours of surgery. Learn more about robotic and minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery.
Causes of hip pain
Common causes of hip pain include:
Arthritis
Tendonitis, which happens when there is inflammation of the thick bands of tissue (tendons) that attach bones to muscles
Orthopaedic trauma, including breaking your hip or bones near your hip
Snapping hip syndrome, which occurs when an inflamed tendon passes across the bony ridge of your hip bone
Sports injuries, including tears in the cartilage lining your hip socket (labral tear)
Straining or overworking the muscles that support your hips
Treatments for hip pain
We consider your medical needs and personal preferences while developing a care plan that meets your unique situation. Many people find relief with nonsurgical treatments. If you do need surgery, we explain the procedure in detail and how it will help you feel better.
Treatments may include:
Medication: Medications may reduce inflammation. You may get relief with an over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen. For stubborn pain, you may need a prescription medication.
Injections: Applying medications to the source of the pain through an injection may help you feel better if other medications aren’t working. Find out more about injections.
Physical therapy: We guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your hips. We also teach you gentle stretches you can perform at home to relieve stiffness. Learn more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
Surgery: If other treatments fail to bring relief, we may recommend surgery to fix tissue tears. If the problem is arthritis, joint repair procedures, including hip resurfacing, may help you avoid a hip replacement. If you do need a hip replacement, we perform advanced procedures to help you feel better, faster. We’ll explain what to expect during the surgery and recovery. Find out more about orthopaedic surgery.
Preventive services: We offer many services, including strength training, to help you feel your best as you recover. These services may also lower your risk for future hip problems. Read more about sports performance services.
