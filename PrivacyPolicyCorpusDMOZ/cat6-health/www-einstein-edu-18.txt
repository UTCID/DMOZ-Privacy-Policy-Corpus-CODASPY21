Sleep Disorders Center
Serviceid = 86CareworksPageId= 695Columns Layout = 5
The Sleep Disorders Center at Einstein Healthcare Network, with locations in Philadelphia, Plymouth Meeting and Elkins Park, a sleep clinic and a sleep laboratory that evaluates and treats sleep disorders such as:
Loud snoring
Breathing problems
Sleep apnea
Choking or gasping during sleep
Insomnia
Restless legs syndrome
Excessive daytime sleepiness
Sleep disorders are characterized by disturbance in the amount, quality or timing of sleep.
Integrated Team Approach
Unlike most sleep programs which are led by pulmonary specialists, Einstein's sleep program is led by a collaborative team of neurologists, cardiologists and pulmonary specialists, enabling us to provide a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach for the management of your sleep disorder.
Einstein's sleep lab experts examine every aspect of care when treating you, ensuring you are comfortable with devices such as masks and dental prostheses that may be used to treat certain conditions.
Sleep Clinic
The sleep clinic is the first step in diagnosis and treatment. At the clinic, board-certified sleep physicians perform patient evaluations and ask for a complete medical and sleep history. Depending on the results, we may recommend:
A series of outpatient visits
A referral for a sleep study in our sleep laboratory
Consultation with another medical specialist
Sleep Laboratory
Sleep studies are performed in a bedroom setting to help make you feel at home. Although most sleep studies are performed overnight, your sleep physician may recommend a study during the day to assess daytime sleepiness.
These studies:
Help determine the cause of sleep problems and the most appropriate course of treatment
Use leading-edge technology to record several bodily functions while you sleep including:
Breathing patterns
Oxygen measurement
Brain activity
Eye movement
Heart rhythms
Patients must be at least 12 years of age. Most insurances are accepted.
