Eden Medical Center Snapshot
At Sutter’s Eden Medical Center, we combine compassionate, patient-centered
care with state-of-the-art technology in a sophisticated, LEED-certified facility.
Our new medical center replaces the original Eden building, which opened its doors
in 1954.
Built for 21st century medicine, the new hospital is seismically safe and takes
advantage of nature’s healing benefits. From the gardens to the use of natural
light, the new Eden Medical Center, which opened in 2012, offers an environment for
healing and comfort for our community.
The hospital has 130 beds, all in private rooms. Eden is the regional trauma center
for Southern Alameda County and features many centers of excellence, including neuroscience,
orthopedics, rehabilitation, birthing center, imaging, stroke and cancer care. Eden
Medical Center is fully accredited by The Joint Commission.
