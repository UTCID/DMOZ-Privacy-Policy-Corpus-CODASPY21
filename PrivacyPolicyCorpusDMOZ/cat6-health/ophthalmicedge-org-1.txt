Legal
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void, unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us with regard to your use of our Services, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous representations, communications, agreements and understandings between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof.
These Terms of Use cannot be modified or supplemented except in a writing expressly stated for such purpose and signed by you and us. Failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use or to exercise any right arising out of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or right, in whole or in part, in that instance or in any other instance.
