Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) has a strong commitment to privacy. This statement outlines the policies and procedures concerning information gathering and dissemination practices related to www.acns.org, as well as member, meeting attendee, and sponsor/supporter (collectively, “users”) data. This policy is in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
Collection of User Information
ACNS collects information from individuals who access its website or otherwise interact with the Society.
ACNS uses forms, both web-based and hardcopy, by which members/customers (users) may request information, products, and services. Order forms are used to collect users information closely related to the requested information, product or service, including, but not limited to:
Contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc);
Demographic information;
Practice information; and
Financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers).
Information collected via these forms relates closely and directly to the information, product, or service requested by the user.
ACNS may also use cookies (a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites) to collect, store, and sometimes track information related to use of the ACNS website.
Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
Information collected via the methods outlined above is used to provide a customized experience as you use the ACNS website or participate in ACNS products and services. User information collected via forms and cookies is used for statistical purposes, to deliver or improve the products and services we provide, or to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services.
Financial information is used to bill the user for products and services and then is deleted from our records in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, contact the user regarding any problems with the order, and to provide the user with information about our association, including promotional materials.
It is the policy of ACNS not to share this information with third parties. Exceptions to this policy include disclosure of personal information collected if we have a legitimate business interest in doing so, have received your permission in advance, or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law, or in other special cases described below.
ACNS may disclose personal information about users, or information regarding your use of our site, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our user policies; to operate the site properly; or to protect ACNS and our users.
Use of ACNS website cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personal information. Third parties and other non-ACNS websites may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. Cookies are used to support Google Analytics functionality for website activity tracking. Google Analytics stores information at Google. View details regarding Google Analytics privacy and security.
