Privacy Policy
The CDC National Prevention Information Network (NPIN) respects the privacy of visitors to the NPIN Website and community.

Privacy Act Statement
If you choose to provide us with business information – by registering on the site, managing your profile or filling out a Contact Us form with your work e-mail and/or work postal addresses and any other information – we use that information to improve usability or respond to your message. If you register for an eNgage account, NPIN might use that information in the future to reach out to you about NPIN products, services and offerings. For your protection, we recommend you not provide any non-work related information. With your information, we cross reference data to perform statistical analysis to better discern the characteristics of those interested in site content or eNgage content so that we can improve the user experience. We will only share information with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never give individual profiles or give information to any private organization.
CDCNPIN never collects information for commercial marketing and is not a system of record. While you must provide an e-mail address or postal address for a response other than those generated automatically in response to questions or comments that you may submit, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal information, especially Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration offers additional guidance on sharing your Social Security number.
Why is information collected?
We may collect a limited amount of information on usage of the Website and community for statistical purposes to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and members of the eNgage community with the goal of helping us make our site more useful to visitors and the community.
What information is collected?
The information collected includes standard server log information, such as the domain name or IP address from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our site; the pages you viewed; the type of browser and operating system you used to access our site; and, if you linked to our site from another Website, that Website's address. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. Our Website logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browse the site. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole, but pages viewed are not identified with individual users.
For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. This NPIN system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.  Participation in the community is personally identified to you but only if you choose to provide such information to us to join and participate.
When inquiries are sent to us via e-mail, we store the question and the e-mail address information so that we can respond electronically.
What information is not collected?
Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends questions or comments to our Website or community. We will not obtain information that will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our Website, unless you choose to provide such information to us to participate in the community.
What about Site Security?
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this NPIN computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
Can I opt-Out?
At any time, you may choose to opt out of the community. When you do this, your request is immediately honored.
Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
