Orthopaedic Trauma
Sudden, severe injuries (trauma), such as the ones that occur from car accidents, can change your life in an instant. At Allegheny Health Network (AHN), you're in capable hands.
We deliver specialized care, including complex reconstructive surgeries that restore the best possible quality of life.
What is orthopaedic trauma?
Orthopaedic trauma includes severe injuries affecting your bones, joints, and supporting tissue. These injuries can occur anywhere in the body and may affect your ability to perform basic functions, such as sitting or standing.
Care for orthopaedic trauma includes:
Immediate treatments, such as casts and braces, to stabilize the injured area and prevent permanent damage
Surgical procedures, which may include repairing broken bones with rods and screws, to help you start healing
Treating complications, such as bones that don’t heal correctly, to help you regain the highest level of functioning
Orthopaedic trauma care at AHN: Why choose us?
At AHN, you receive care from orthopaedic surgeons who completed additional training (fellowships) in orthopaedic trauma. These capabilities draw patients from all over western Pennsylvania and surrounding communities.
Our experience from treating thousands of injuries every year translates to an exceptional level of care. Meet our orthopaedic and sports medicine team.
