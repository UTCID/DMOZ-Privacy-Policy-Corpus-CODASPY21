Privacy Practices
Patients & Visitors
From the time you arrive, to the time you return home, Star Valley Health’s goal is to provide you and your family an exceptional health care experience. We will treat you just like you and your family are a part of our family. If you can’t find what you are looking for please call 307-885-5800 for assistance.
Please provide us feedback on your stay by completing our We Want to Hear From You survey.
Patient Confidentiality
We are committed to patient privacy and confidentiality. Our confidentiality policy allows inpatients to choose who receives details about their health condition. Upon admission, each inpatient receives a personal health information (PHI) code that they may share with friends and family if they’d like.
We are committed to keeping your health information confidential. To report a compliance issue please call the Star Valley Health Compliance Hotline: 307-885-5999
Infection Control
Many patients at Star Valley Health’s facilities may struggle with weakened immune systems, which make them very susceptible to a variety of illnesses. People who are ill with a cold, fever, diarrhea, flu, or any other communicable disease should not come into the hospital or care center. In addition, children who have been exposed to chicken pox, measles, mumps, pinkeye, or rubella should not visit patients in the hospital or care center.
We wish to protect all our patients, visitors, and staff from infections and communicable diseases. For this reason, our staff follows precautions to prevent the spread of germs from all patients—not just patients who have infections or communicable diseases. These precautions may include hand washing, the use of hand sanitizer and special clothing such as gloves, gowns, etc. If visitors need to take special precautions before entering the hospital room, there will be a sign posted on the patient’s door. An attending nurse will be happy to assist you.
