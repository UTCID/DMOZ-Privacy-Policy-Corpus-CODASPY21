By using the site and/or content, you acknowledge your absolute and unqualified agreement to such terms and conditions. Please read this agreement carefully and completely.
Please watch your language: At Mountain Scene, we strongly believe in Freedom of Expression but we draw the line at inappropriate language, unnecessarily hurtful or defamatory statements, or personal comments which attack the person rather than their actions or opinions. We accordingly reserve the right (but without obligation or explanation) to edit or delete entirely your contributions. Repeated breaches of our Terms and Conditions may result in your being suspended temporarily or banned permanently. If you have been suspended or banned but believe you have a case for reinstatement, please email webmaster@scene.co.nz
Contributions unedited: Please realise contributions from users are unedited and you may well view them before our webmaster does. As a result, we can in no way endorse any contribution or be held responsible for inaccuracies – even if its author may claim to be an “expert”. As a result, each individual must take sole personal responsibility both as a contributor and as a viewer.
Your ‘Good Taste’ warranty: Your contributions to this site are strictly conditional on your agreement not to post any comments or material which is or could be deemed to be:
defamatory
abusive
threatening
obscene
sexual
The guiding principle at all times shall be whether or not contributed material meets a standard that would be considered acceptable by the average New Zealander. Decisions in respect of this are ours and ours alone. We are not required to explain our reasons.
Have your say on offensive or inappropriate material: If you feel a contribution to our site is objectionable or inappropriate, click the ‘Suggest Removal’ link to bring your concerns to our attention. We are not obliged to do so but if we share those concerns we may remove the material. In that context we may liaise with the appropriate authorities, and/or Police, and/or seek legal advice as we see fit. This may include postings under user names which themselves may be objectionable or inappropriate. Offensive or inappropriate user names, or those posting offensive or inappropriate material, may be banned permanently at our sole discretion.
Your Ownership Warranty: Sending contributions to our site is strictly subject to your personal guarantee that such material will not breach any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties. In contributing, you are promising us that you are the owner or creator of the material submitted – or if a third party is the author or creator of some or all of the material, that you are submitting it with their explicit consent. If you steal material from others in an unauthorised way for site contributions, you may be legally liable.
Other No-Nos: In contributing to our site, you agree without qualification NOT to:
Solicit others.

This ban includes, but is not limited to, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation.
Assume multiple personalities. Each user must have only one user name. If you would like to change this name, please e-mail us. Hiding behind multiple user names may result in our banning your user account or accounts.
Create objectionable user names. The decision on what may constitute an objectionable user name is ours and ours alone and you agree to be bound by our decision without challenge.
Contribute material containing viruses or any other computer code, files or content designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any software or hardware, telecommunications, or other equipment.
Pretend to be someone else.
Release any private information regarding other users.

2. Use: you agree that you will only use the Photograph for your personal and domestic use only (Permitted Purpose). You will not reproduce, vary, modify, sell or display in a public place (including public areas in a place of business) the Photograph without prior written permission from Mountain Scene.
