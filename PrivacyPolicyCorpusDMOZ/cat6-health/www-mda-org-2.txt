We may also modify this Agreement from time to time, and at any time, without notice to you, for any reason, in our sole discretion. Changes become effective immediately and your continued use of the Site and the Services will signify your agreement to be bound by the changes. We recommend that you check back frequently and review both this Agreement and the Privacy Policy regularly, so you are aware of the most current rights and obligations that apply to you. In addition, some Services may include Additional Terms (e.g., Services that allow for the dissemination of certain materials, use of embeddable or viral features, apps, etc.), and to the extent those terms conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Additional Terms shall control.
6. Third-Party Platforms, Services and Content
The Site may contain links to third-party websites content, data, information, applications, platforms, goods, services or materials (collectively, “Third-Party Services”) that are not controlled by MDA. Links to Third-Party Services do not constitute an endorsement by, nor do they incur any obligation, responsibility or liability on the part of MDA, even if MDA’s logos, name, marks and/or sponsorship identification appear in connection with the Third-Party Services as part of a branding, promotional, outsourcing arrangement, or otherwise. If any Third Party-Services that you have accessed through the Site obtain or collect personal information from you, in no event shall we assume or have any responsibility or liability in connection with any use, collection or disclosure by or in connection with such Third Party-Services. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party-Service you use.
7. Social Media Services
As part of the Services, the Website may also provide links to MDA’s social media channels. Activity on the MDA social media channels is subject to both this Agreement and the terms of service of the respective social media platform (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn). However, only the privacy policy of the applicable social media platform applies to any personal information you provide to it. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each social media platform you use.

The Services may provide you and other users with the opportunity to submit, post, email, display, transmit or otherwise make available photos, videos, ideas, opinions and other content and information via the Services (collectively, “User Content”). When you submit User Content you may also be asked to provide information about you and your submission. This may include such things as your User Credentials, information about the User Content, your location, your diagnosis, activities, preferences, photographs, media and/or similar information. By submitting User Content, you acknowledge and agree that the term “User Content” also includes and refers to all of the information you submit, or we may receive that is related to your User Content. You further acknowledge and agree that unless explicitly stated otherwise, all User Content submitted by means of or in connection with any portion of the Services are public and that (a) you have no expectation of privacy in any User Content and (b) no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied or other relationship is created between you and MDA by reason of your transmitting User Content to the Site or in connection with the Services.

MDA does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, quality or content of any User Content. Under no circumstances shall MDA be liable in any way for User Content or such other content, including errors or omissions in any User Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of any User Content, including infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
8.3 Review of User Content
MDA has the right, but not the obligation, to review any User Content and to delete, remove, move, edit or reject, without notice to you, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, any User Content; provided, however, that MDA shall have no obligation or liability to you or any third party for failure to do so or for doing so in any particular manner.
8.4 License to Use User Content
In connection with all User Content you submit, post, email, display, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services, you grant to MDA the unqualified, unrestricted, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, fully-paid up and royalty-free right and license, in any form or format, on or through any media or medium and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered, in whole or in part, to host, cache, store, maintain, use, reproduce, distribute, display, exhibit, perform, publish, broadcast, transmit, modify, prepare derivative works of, adapt, reformat, translate, and otherwise exploit all or any portion of your User Content in connection with the Services and any other websites, channels, services, and other distribution platforms, whether currently existing or developed in the future, for any purpose whatsoever (including for any promotional purposes) without accounting, notification, credit or other obligation to you, and the right to license and sub-license and authorize others to exercise any of the rights granted hereunder to MDA, in our sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights, licenses and privileges described in this Agreement and granted to MDA shall commence immediately upon submission of your User Content and shall continue thereafter perpetually and indefinitely, regardless of whether you use the Services as a registered user or not.
8.5 Ownership of User Content

This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and MDA concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision which must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of this Agreement; however, no action arising out of this Agreement or your use of the Services, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause arose). The failure of MDA to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

The Site can be accessed throughout the United States and the world, and each jurisdiction where a user may reside may have laws that are different to and/or conflict with the laws of State of New York. This Agreement and your use of the Services is governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York (notwithstanding the state's conflict of laws provisions) applicable to contracts made, executed and wholly performed in New York, and, for the purposes of any and all legal or equitable actions, you specifically agree and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the State and Federal Courts situated in the State and County of New York and agree you shall not object to such jurisdiction or venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or otherwise.
