Contact Us
The Contact Us page is the primary means of communication with KidsHealth staff
for a website visitor. Website visitors may use the Contact Us page to send content
suggestions or questions about the Parents, Kids, or Teens areas of the site directly
to the Parents, Kids, or Teens editorial staff. Website visitors may also use this
form to ask general questions about the Website or content, submit notification of
broken links, communicate privacy concerns, and/or submit praise and/or complaints.
All comments are seen by the Editor-in-Chief of KidsHealth who, along with senior
editorial staff, handle all content-related issues and will use these comments, for
instance, as ideas for generating new content or answering a question in a Q&A
section on the site. All technical and operational issues are forwarded to the Director
of Operations for handling. As KidsHealth policy is not to respond to visitor email,
the Contact Us page does not ask for any personally identifiable information (such
as an email address), and the only way personally identifiable information would be
collected is if the visitor were to voluntarily type such information into one of
the open text fields. The Contact Us page is secured using 128-bit encryption. Any
health information submitted through the Contact Us page is not stored in a way that
is personally identifiable. We may, unless you indicate otherwise, store, edit, and
excerpt your email for use in Q&As, presentations, analyses, and other similar
purposes. In these cases, we will delete any content that would specifically identify
you as the writer of the email.
Newsletters
The only personally identifiable information that is actively collected by KidsHealth
are email addresses of individuals who opt-in to our newsletter programs. These email
addresses are only used for delivering our newsletters. These addresses are not typically
viewed by a human being unless there is some problem with the database. Users may
remove their email address from our list by using the unsubscribe link provided at
the bottom of each newsletter.
A Note to Parents
Our Kids section is intended to be a safe resource for children under 13 to find
useful, age-appropriate information. Although The Nemours Foundation is a nonprofit,
charitable foundation and as such is not subject to the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act, it takes children's privacy very seriously. The Nemours Foundation
and KidsHealth do not sell the information sent to it, whether by children or anyone
else. In addition to collecting information about your use of our website (see "Privacy"),
KidsHealth also collects personally identifiable information through services offered
on our site:
Email newsletters, administered through ExactTarget,
which are opt-in, and contain links to content on the site.
Quick Polls, administered through Polldaddy,
which are opt-in polls inviting readers to submit their opinion.
Surveys, administered through SurveyMonkey,
which are opt-in surveys inviting readers to submit their opinion.
Our Contact Us page does not ask for any personally identifiable information. Sometimes,
children write KidsHealth with a personal medical question. As stated elsewhere, KidsHealth
generally does not answer such questions and does not collect email addresses on the
Contact Us form in order to be able to respond. However, there are times when a visitor
includes an email address and a physician believes it is advisable to ask a follow-up
question or offer a comment, for instance, in the case of a life-threatening condition.
Only in these rare and serious instances will KidsHealth respond to an individual
communication or take action on the information.
Security
KidsHealth employs reasonable security measures to protect the personal information
You submit to it. Such security involves the use of SSL-secured Web forms, firewalls,
and other commonly employed security methods.
User Submissions
KidsHealth welcomes Your comments on its site and content. However, You acknowledge
that if You send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, inventions,
or other information (collectively, the "Information"), the Information shall be deemed,
and shall remain, the property of KidsHealth. By submission of any Information to
us, You assign to us and we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing
rights to such Information and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Information
for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to You.
As a user of this site, You are responsible for Your own communications and are
responsible for the consequences of their posting. Therefore, do not do any of the
following things: transmit to us material that is copyrighted, unless You are the
copyright owner or have the permission of the copyright owner to post it; send material
that reveals trade secrets, unless You own them or have the permission of the owner;
send material that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or
on the privacy or publicity rights of others; send material that is obscene, defamatory,
threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another user or any other
person or entity; send sexually explicit images; send advertisements or solicitations
of business; send chain letters or pyramid schemes; or impersonate another person.
KidsHealth reserves the right to expel users and prevent their further access to
this site for violating these terms or the law and reserves the right to remove any
communications from this site. The violation of any of the terms and conditions set
forth on this Terms and Conditions page shall result in the immediate revocation of
Your right to use the content and obligates You to immediately destroy any copies
of the content in Your possession.
Editorial Policies
Articles and features published on this site undergo a rigorous editorial
process that includes extensive review by medical
professionals. However, all information on this site is for educational purposes
only. For specific medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment, consult Your doctor.
The editorial staff makes every effort to be as neutral as possible with regard
to gender, race, color, religion, and age. Within the articles, the site takes turns
referring to infants, children, and teens as "he" or "she." Remember that even if
an article says he or she, it is referring to male and female infants, children, and
teens, unless otherwise specified.
Links
This site contains links to websites owned by third parties. These links appear
as resources associated with individual articles. These resources are listed on a
separate page and users are cautioned at the top of these pages that clicking links
to listed resources will take them off the KidsHealth site. These links are provided
solely as a convenience to You and are not an endorsement by KidsHealth of the contents
of those other sites. KidsHealth is not responsible for the content of any linked
sites and makes no representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials
on such sites. If You decide to visit any third-party sites using links from this
site, You do so at Your own risk.
Emails Claiming to Be From KidsHealth
Occasionally, in a scam known as "phishing," mass emailers will send messages that
claim to be from KidsHealth. They may use our name, logo, or employee email addresses
in fraudulent emails trying to obtain valuable information from consumers and businesses.
These con artists know that people trust KidsHealth. That's why they may use our name
or that of some other well-known organization to trick people into believing that
they are dealing with a legitimate request for personal information. These fraudulent
emails often create a false sense of urgency intended to prompt the recipient to take
action.
KidsHealth does not send out unsolicited emails or commercial endorsements, and
does not ask for detailed personal information. If you get this sort of email appearing
to be from KidsHealth, you should assume that it is fraudulent and avoid clicking
any link within the email.
Disclaimer of Warranties
KidsHealth does not warrant that the site will operate error-free or that the site
or its server are free of computer viruses or other harmful material. If Your use
of the site or the site's material results in the need for servicing or replacing
of equipment or data, KidsHealth shall not be responsible for those costs. This site
and its material are provided on an "as is" basis without any warranties of any kind.
KIDSHEALTH, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES' RIGHTS,
AND THE WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Disclaimer of Consequential Damages
IN NO EVENT SHALL KIDSHEALTH, ITS EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS,
OR ANY THIRD PARTIES MENTIONED IN THE SITE CONTENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOST
PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM
