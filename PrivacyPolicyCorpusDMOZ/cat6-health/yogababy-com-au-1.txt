We want to provide a safe and secure environment for you and your children.yogababy is concerned about protecting the safety and privacy of young people using our services. We encourage you to participate in your child's online experience.The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind and how much information you provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy and to give you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.This policy applies only to yogababy and not to other companies' or organisations' websites to which yogababy is linked.Collection of informationInformation is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.

It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.yogababy collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us.

We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more valuable to you.Sometimes, we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service. Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you.

The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us, for example when you take part in a discussion forum.Use of anonymous informationyogababy automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor the use of yogababy like the numbers and frequency of visitors to yogababy and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve yogababy to ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many users as possible. yogababy may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.Use of personal informationyogababy will only use the personal information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you provided it. yogababy will not use it for any other purpose without your consent.CookiesThe yogababy Shop site currently uses cookies.DisclosureThere will be occasions where it will be necessary for yogababy to disclose your personal information to third parties. yogababy may be required by law to disclose the information, or yogababy may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service you have requested. For example, if you purchase products online from the yogababy Shop, yogababy will need to disclose your personal information to third parties in order to bill and deliver your products. However, the disclosure will only be made where it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which you disclosed your personal information. Otherwise than stated above, we do not disclose personal information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organisation or person outside yogababy unless you have authorised us to do so.

In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Therefore, we recommend that you refrain from posting any information that you do not want seen in these public areas. For example, when participating in a yogababy forum, your name will appear on the message board. If you do not want your real name to appear use a false name but do not under any circumstances use somebody else's name.Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any personal information.

I didn’t think it was possible to love a tiny human as much!

Nothing I read or anything anyone told me could have prepared me for birth, it was short but intense. Thanks again for all the yoga classes and breathing. Like so many people said you’ll do all this preparation but it just depends on the day! Georgina is doing really well and we’re over the moon. I didn’t think it was possible to love a tiny human as much.

Rachael's challenging & rewarding natural birth

My biggest driver for having a natural birth was to improve my chances of breast feeding and I’m pleased to say our little Oscar is thriving, putting on a kilogram in his first month of life with exclusive breastfeeding. It was such a challenging time but you helped us be as prepared as possible. We can’t thank you enough!
