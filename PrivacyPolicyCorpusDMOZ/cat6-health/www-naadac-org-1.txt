Description
Burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma are landmines in the field of addiction work. Many of us struggle with work demands, familial expectations, and the desire for a fulfilling personal life. Our supervisors remind us of self-care, but who has the energy to add one more task to a stressful day? In order to thrive in this field, it’s crucial we shine a light on what really matters when it comes to caring for ourselves and the barriers that get in the way of being our best selves. This experiential workshop will differentially define burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma; provide a deep understanding of self-compassion; and support participants in evaluating crucial components of their individual self-care plan to support the healthiest version of themselves.
Learning Objectives
Define burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma.
Explain the components of self-compassion and demonstrate an understanding of tools to enhance self-compassion practices.
Analyze the necessary components to create an individualized plan to decrease stress.
