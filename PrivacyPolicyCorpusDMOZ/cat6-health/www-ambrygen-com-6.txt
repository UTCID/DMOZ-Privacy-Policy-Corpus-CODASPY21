Intellectual Property All Content made available through the Website and Services are the property of Ambry, unless otherwise indicated, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

Arbitration and Class Action Waiver REVIEW THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR ABILITY TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CLAIMS IN COURT, YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY DECIDE CERTAIN CLAIMS, AND YOUR ABILITY TO COMBINE CLAIMS AND TO BRING CLAIMS THROUGH CLASS ACTIONS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY USING AND/OR BECOMING A REGISTERED USER OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES, YOU CONSENT AND CHOOSE TO HAVE SUCH CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.
A. Mandatory Arbitration of Certain Claims
You agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Section, all Claims (defined as any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, your use of or inability to use the Website, Content or Services, except the following types of disputes and controversies: (a) any claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Ambry’s intellectual property rights; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use; (c) any claim for injunctive relief; and (d) any claim within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims courts) shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the Claim is filed (“AAA Rules”). Each Claim shall be submitted to a single arbitrator selected through mutual agreement of the parties. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement. Except as otherwise indicated in these Terms and Conditions, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, and/or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions and any terms or documents incorporated herein, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions are void or voidable. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Orange County, California and shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions and the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof. The arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action (as defined below) nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Before you take a dispute to arbitration or to small claims court, you must first contact us in writing and describe (a) the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) the specific relief sought and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Similarly, before Ambry takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If you and Ambry do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days from the date such notification is provided, you or Ambry may commence an arbitration proceeding.
If Ambry prevails before the arbitrator, and if we show that you acted in bad faith in bringing your claim, then Ambry may seek to recover the AAA’s fees and expenses of the arbitrator from you.
B. Class Action Waiver
Each of you and Ambry expressly agree that any Claim(s) must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). You and Ambry expressly agree to waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum raising a Claim covered by this Section. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, any Claim, dispute, or controversy alleging that all or part of the Class Action waiver contained in this Section is invalid, illegal, unenforceable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
Links to Third-Party Services The Website and Services may contain links to other sites, applications, and resources provided by third parties or references to specific medical professionals by name, address, or affiliation. You acknowledge and agree that (a) Ambry is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, (b) all links and identifications are provided solely for your convenience and for other informational purposes, and (c) Ambry does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites, resources, or medical professionals or their affiliations.
Governing Law & Venue You agree that any dispute relating to the Services will be resolved according to the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law rules. You agree that the courts of the State of California have exclusive jurisdiction over any legal proceedings arising out of or related to your use of the Services. If you are accessing the Services from any location with regulations or laws governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from United States laws or regulations, please note that you are transferring personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer and to the collection and processing of such information in the United States.
Equitable Relief You agree that any material breach of these terms and conditions will result in irreparable harm to Ambry for which damages would be an inadequate remedy, and therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Ambry will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Ambry seeks such an injunction.
Severability If any part of the Terms & Conditions is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be enforceable for any reason, this will not affect the validity of the other parts of the Terms & Conditions, which will continue to be in full force and effect.
Entire Agreement You acknowledge that these Terms & Conditions represent the entire agreement between you and Ambry with respect to the Services, and that no other representations or promises, verbal or otherwise, will affect these Terms & Conditions.
