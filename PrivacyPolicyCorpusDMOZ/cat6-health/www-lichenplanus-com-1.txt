It has been a great experience with lifeforce. Doctors are really good, friendly and caring the procedure of treatment took a little time but it was really beneficial for me. I was disappointed and lost all my hopes when I came here for the first time all the medicine that used in allopathy was of no use but here, at last, I am fully cured and satisfied and my disease of lichen planus has totally disappeared. Thanks a lot to Dr. Rajesh Shah and Dr. Kanchan.
Nazia Farooque - Lichen Planus - Mumbai
My previous homeopathy treatment from your clinic was five years ago. That was the first time I was diagnosed with Lichen Planus. I had an outbreak on my stomach, arms and underarms. I responded to the treatment very well - everything had cleared out within 2-3 months and I haven't had an outbreak of Lichen Planus since, until now..

What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is an alternative method of treatment, based on nature’s law of cure, namely ‘Like Cures Like’. The truth of this law was discovered by a German scientist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 and has been verified experimentally and clinically for 200 years. Homeopathy is the revolutionary, natural medical science. Homeopathy is a gentle and effective system of medicine. The remedies are prepared from natural substances to precise standards and work by stimulating the body’s own healing mechanisms.Learn More
