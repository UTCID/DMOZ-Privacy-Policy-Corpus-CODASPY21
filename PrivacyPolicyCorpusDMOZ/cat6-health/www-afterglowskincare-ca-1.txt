COVID-19 UPDATE:
Afterglow is OPEN and ready to welcome women and men seeking the best in aesthetic care. We've expanded and redecorated our practice and have adopted special safety precautions in the wake of the pandemic. This includes cleaning and disinfecting rooms and workstations throughout the day to help all of our patients and staff remain healthy. We have closed our Ambleside location, but the newly expanded Afterglow—less than 7 km away—is ready to accommodate Ambleside patients. We look forward to seeing you soon!
