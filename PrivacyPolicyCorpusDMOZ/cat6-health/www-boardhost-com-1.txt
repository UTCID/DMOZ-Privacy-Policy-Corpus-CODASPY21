board and forum operators.
In consideration for your right to use the Service, you agree as follows:

Boardhost.com, Inc. ("Boardhost") provides access to interactive message boards and forums, created and maintained by its customers,
to users who are at least eighteen (18) years old and to minors over the age of thirteen (13) who have parental permission.
Service is provided "as is."
There may be, among other things, unexpected downtimes, loss of data, or interruptions of
service. BOARDHOST SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DATA LOSSES,
OR OTHERWISE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF BUSINESS.
Boardhost is not obligated to monitor the Service, but may do so and may remove or edit any message or adjust your
access to the Service.
Messages that Boardhost may, in its sole discretion, elect to remove or edit include without
limitation those which violate the "Restrictions" enumerated herein.
CONTENT
Boardhost ordinarily does not review messages before they are posted to its message boards or forums.
Opinions expressed on a Boardhost message
board or forum are those of the message author and not of Boardhost.
Likewise, Boardhost makes no representations or
warranties concerning the truth or falsity of any assertion of fact made by message authors (other than Boardhost)
on a Boardhost message board or forum.
If permitted by a message board or forum's owner, users may create a custom poll in their message.
Although our poll feature has been designed to limit a unique
user to one vote, Boardhost cannot guarantee such an outcome.
Polls and their results are provided for entertainment only, and poll results
may be skewed for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the group of users targeted.
Polls are subject to all other provisions of
these usage terms.
Some Boardhost customers include their own rules or policies on their message board or forum.
Boardhost does not review, endorse, or enforce
such rules or policies.
Any such rules or policies that customers include on their message boards or forums do not bind Boardhost and are to
be regarded as mere expressions of the customer's preferences.
BOARDHOST SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF ANY MESSAGES POSTED BY THIRD PARTIES OR YOU TO OR THROUGH THE USE OF ANY BOARDHOST MESSAGE BOARD OR FORUM.
