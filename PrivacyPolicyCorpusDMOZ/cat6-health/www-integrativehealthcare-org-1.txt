Security
Q. How secure are the Natural Wellness websites?
A. Extremely secure. We use two international companies, VeriSign® and GeoTrust®, to verify our security so you can have confidence that your information is being sent privately and securely.
VeriSign® and GeoTrust® provide us with a 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for domestic browsers and a 40 bit SSL for internationally released browser versions. What this means is that virtually no hacker in the world can access your information on its way to our server. Nor can they gain access to our server and get the information in anything but a scrambled form.
You see, the secure server mode encrypts or codes all the information between your browser and our server. This way the information looks like gibberish to anyone trying to intercept it. Your information will stay secure.
Unless you see the "secure server" icon (a small lock that appears on the bottom of the screen in Internet Explorer), the information you send to any site can be intercepted. When you are on a secure site like the Natural Wellness® family of websites, there is a complex authentication process that takes place. The certificate you see on the site tells you an independent company has verified the security of the server. VeriSign® and GeoTrust® are the most highly regarded Secure Server companies in the world.
Our shopping cart is also tested and certified daily to pass the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test. The "live" HACKER SAFE mark appears only when a web site's security meets the highest security scanning standards of the U.S. government, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.
Sites free of all known vulnerabilities that can be remotely scanned for, such as those earning HACKER SAFE certification, prevent over 99.99% of hacker crime.
