Telemental Health

Search for an ADAA Member Telemental Health Provider in Your Area.
Telemental Health
Online therapy, also known as telemental health, is a growing field. A therapist or counselor provides psychological counseling and support over the internet through email, video conferencing, online chat, or a phone call.
Telemental health may be useful to individuals who cannot leave their home, who work unconventional hours, as well as those overseas or who live in rural or remote areas.
Listen to the podcast Innovative Technology: Telehealth, Tablets, & Other Technologies: What patients need to know about telehealth technologies for treating anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD, including privacy and security concerns.
You may want to research this treatment option to determine if it can be helpful for you. Ask your mental health provider about their experiences or thoughts on telemental health. Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party reimbursement may be available; also, check with your insurance provider.
Executive Order on Improving Rural Health and Telehealth Access - Signed on August 3, 2020
