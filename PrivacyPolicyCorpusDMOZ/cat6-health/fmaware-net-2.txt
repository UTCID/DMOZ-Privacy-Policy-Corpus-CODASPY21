By Laura Jones It all began around the age of six. I had scarlet fever at this time, which had me down for quite a while. After this tough bout of illness, I remember having headaches very often, even up until now. It wasn’t normal to be such a young child dealing with constant [...]

I received the official diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) three years ago this January. I had been experiencing symptoms for about a year before the diagnosis, and besides the pain, I especially had trouble sleeping. I would be so tired throughout the day—that constant fatigue!

Not even the subject of sexuality is as taboo as constipation, diarrhea, and flatulence While such topics constitute “bathroom humor” among young people, they are more likely to elicit embarrassed silence or quiet apologies in adult social situations. But those who suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)- a disorder characterized by [...]

Ever since being diagnosed with fibro­myalgia, Jean Turner has experienced what she refers to as "fibrofog." "I can forget my train of thought in mid-sentence, and often struggle to retain detailed information," explains the Reading, England, resident.

By: Jessie Carr In my 18 years of battling various chronic illnesses, with all the terrible symptoms and the terrible doctors and the even more terrible social and emotional challenges of being a “sick” person, nothing has been so debilitating as my ongoing war with vulvodynia.
