Privacy Policy/Legal
Updated 5/24/2018
Privacy Statement
AHDI is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the AHDI website and governs data collection and usage. By using the AHDI website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
Collection of your Personal Information
AHDI collects personally identifiable information, such as your email address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. AHDI also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, job role, and work setting.
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by AHDI. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by AHDI for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the AHDI Web site.
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through AHDI public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: AHDI does not read any of your private online communications.
AHDI encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from AHDI so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. AHDI is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the AHDI and AHDI family of websites.
Use of your Personal Information
As part of a membership, purchase, subscription, or registration agreement, members and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, email, and/or phone to communicate with them about their membership, purchase, and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, surveys, updates concerning their account profile, and special offers related to their membership, purchase, and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes. Members/customers are provided with the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from AHDI. You may contact AHDI to update your preferences or simply click the opt-out link on the bottom of any AHDI email.
AHDI may contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (email, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the external business partner. In addition, AHDI may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to AHDI, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Members/customers of AHDI may opt out of third-party mailings at any time. When logged into the website, you can manage your preferences by going to “Manage Profile.” An opt-out option is available at the bottom of all emails or you can contact AHDI at ahdi@ahdionline.org or 800-982-2182 to have your record updated.
AHDI does not collect sensitive personal information such as race, religion, or political affiliations. Information such as passwords and credit card numbers are never disclosed in any form to any outside party.
AHDI keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within AHDI, in order to determine what AHDI services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within AHDI to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
AHDI websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process served on AHDI or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AHDI; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of AHDI or the public.
Use of Cookies
The AHDI website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize AHDI pages, or register with the AHDI site or services, a cookie helps AHDI to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same AHDI website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the AHDI features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the AHDI services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
AHDI secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. AHDI secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
AHDI will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. AHDI encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how AHDI is protecting your information.
Contact Information
AHDI welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that AHDI has not adhered to this Statement, please contact AHDI at webmaster@ahdionline.org. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
