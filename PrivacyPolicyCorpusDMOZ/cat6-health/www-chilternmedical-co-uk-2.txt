YOUR DATA
Under data protection legislation, the data that organisations hold about you can be categorised as follows:
Personal Data: This is data related to an identifiable person or data that can be used to identify a distinct individual. Examples of personal data we collect and process include names, email addresses, location, telephone numbers, ID numbers and online identifiers. Where this policy states “your data/your personal data” we are referring to Personal Data unless otherwise stated.
Sensitive Personal Data: Sometimes referred to as “Special Category Data”, this is data that is deemed to be more sensitive than the above personal data. For example, medical records, genetics, biometric data, details of ethnicity, sexual orientation. We only use this data for the purposes of your treatment and to ensure your care and safety as a patient. We will usually ask for your consent to collect or process this data, though there may be instances where we are required or permitted to do so by applicable law (e.g. to comply with public health requirements). We never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes.
THE LEGAL BASES WE RELY ON
Under data protection legislation, organisations must have one of a number of reasons for processing your personal data. Below we outline the bases we use and an example of the purpose for which it is used:
Consent: In some situations, we ask for your consent to process your data for the purpose we have identified.
For example, we ask you to tick a box on our enquiry form to receive our special offer or newsletter emails.
As a patient you may be asked for consent to allow us to collect sensitive personal data about you to ensure your safe treatment and care.
Contractual obligations: Sometimes we may need your data to fulfil our obligations.
For example, if you wish to book an appointment we may need your payment details, address and contact details to process payment and secure your booking.
Legal compliance: There may be some situations where we are required by law or regulatory bodies to process your data
For example, we may require you provide proof of ID and age where the law requires.
Gathering information as part of investigations by regulatory bodies or in connection with legal proceedings or requests.
Legitimate interests: In some situations, we require your data to pursue our interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not significantly impact your rights or freedom.
For example, we will use the contact details you provide, to call/SMS/email you regarding your enquiry and provide you with targeted relevant information.
We may combine and anonymise your data with that of other customers to identify trends and help make improvements to our service and business.

USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We want to give you the best possible experience from your very first interaction with us. One way to achieve this is to better understand who you are by collecting data about you.
We use this to make improvements to our service and to communicate information that you are likely to be interested in.
There are many cases where we are required to collect and process data about you either to fulfil our contractual obligations to you or to comply with the law.
We use your personal data for the following purposes:
To contact you regarding your enquiry – we have to collect and process your data in order to fulfil your request for further information or to book an appointment.
To provide you with further information about the subject of your enquiry so you understand your options and can make an informed decision.
To remind you by email to book subsequent appointments for a treatment you have previously had which requires ongoing review.

HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED DURING PROVISION OF TREATMENT OR SERVICES
Sensitive personal data (including information relating to your health) will only be disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. That includes third parties involved with your treatment or care, or in accordance with UK laws and guidelines of appropriate professional bodies. Where applicable, it may be disclosed to any person or organisation that may be responsible for meeting your treatment expenses or their agents (such as the NHS). It may also be provided to external service providers and regulatory bodies (unless you object) for the purpose of clinical audit to ensure the highest standards of care and record keeping are maintained.
Medical professionals working with us: We share clinical information about you with our medical professionals as we think necessary for your treatment. Medical professionals working with us might be our employees, or they might be independent consultants in private practice. In the case of independent consultants, the consultant is the data controller of your personal data, either alone or jointly with us and will be required to maintain their own records in accordance with Data Protection Laws and applicable clinical confidential guidelines and retention periods. Where that is the case, we may refer you to that consultant to exercise your rights over your data. Our contracts with consultants require them to cooperate with those requests. In all circumstances, those individual consultants will only process your personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise notified to you.
External practitioners: If we refer you externally for treatment, we will share with the person or organisation that we refer you to, the clinical and administrative information we consider necessary for that referral. It will always be clear when we do this and we will ask for your consent beforehand.
Your GP: If the practitioners treating you believe it to be clinically advisable, we may also share information about your treatment with your GP. You can ask us not to do this, in which case we will respect that request if we are legally permitted to do so, but you should be aware that it can be potentially very dangerous and/or detrimental to your health to deny your GP full information about your medical history, and we strongly advise against it.
Your insurer: We share with your medical insurer information about your treatment, its clinical necessity and its cost, only if they are paying for all or part of your treatment with us. We provide only the information to which they are entitled. If you raise a complaint or a claim we may be required to share personal data with your medical insurer for the purposes of investigating any complaint/claim.
The NHS: If you are referred to us for treatment by the NHS, we will share the details of your treatment with the part of the NHS that referred you to us, as necessary to perform, process and report back on that treatment.
Medical regulators: We may be requested – and in some cases can be required – to share certain information (including personal data and sensitive personal data) about you and your care with medical regulators such as the General Medical Council, for example if you make a complaint, or the conduct of a medical professional involved in your treatment is alleged to have fallen below the appropriate standards and the regulator wishes to investigate. We will ensure that we do so within the framework of the law and with due respect for your privacy.
From time to time we may also make information available on the basis of necessity for the provision of healthcare, but subject always to patient confidentiality.
In an emergency and if you are incapacitated, we may also process your personal data (including sensitive personal data) or make personal data available to third parties on the basis of protecting your ‘vital interest’ (i.e. your life or your health).
We will use your personal data in order to monitor the outcome of your treatment by us and any treatment associated with your care, including any NHS treatment.
We participate in audits and initiatives to help ensure that patients are getting the best possible outcomes from their treatment and care. The highest standards of confidentiality will be applied to your personal data in accordance with Data Protection Laws and confidentiality. Any publishing of this data will be in anonymised, statistical form. Anonymous or aggregated data may be used by us, or disclosed to others, for research or statistical purposes.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA
We take the security of your data seriously and take all appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorised access, loss and misuse. We never sell any of your personal data for any purpose. We never give your details to third parties to use your data to enable them to provide you with information regarding unrelated goods or services. Any sensitive personal data we may collect (such as medical records) is never used for marketing purposes and access to such data is further restricted.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?
We only keep your data to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. At the end of the period, your data will either be deleted or anonymised so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis which helps us make improvements to our service and business.
STORING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
In operating our website, it may become necessary to transfer data that we collect from you to locations outside of the European Union for processing and storing. By providing your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. We do our utmost to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to make sure that your data is stored securely.
Unfortunately, the sending of information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be intercepted. We cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically (e.g. via email) – sending such information is entirely at your own risk.
WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH
We will never sell or share your data to any third parties. We want to maintain your trust as a reputable company and believe this is essential to ensure this.
However, we do use third parties to support, manage or deliver some of our day to day business services.
As a result, we may share non-sensitive personal data with the following type of companies we work with:
Companies that help us deliver our emails and electronic communications to you.
Companies that support our website, phone handling and other IT/business systems.
Companies that provide analytics services.
Facebook and Instagram to show you our services that might interest you whilst you’re browsing the internet or on social media platforms. This is based on your acceptance of cookies on our websites.
We select these companies carefully and take precautions to keep your data safe and protect your privacy:
We only provide the data they need to perform the services we require.
They may only use your data for the purposes we specify and agree with them.
THIRD PARTY LINKS
On occasion we include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy before sending them any personal data.
WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?
You have many rights relating to your personal data including:
The right to access the personal data we hold about you.
The right to request the correction of inaccurate data about you. If we hold inaccurate or out of date information about you, you can request that we change or update it.
The right to request that we delete your data or stop processing it – in some instances such as where we no longer need it, we can delete your personal data.
The right to stop direct marketing – You have the absolute right to stop our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In this instance we must always comply with your request.
The right to withdraw your consent – Whenever you have given us your consent to use your personal data, you have the right to change your mind and tell us.
Please note there may be instances where we refuse your request for any of the above (unless otherwise stated) where we have a strong overriding reason or are legally obliged to.
If you wish to exercise any of your rights, have a complaint or questions about this Policy, please see the ‘WHO WE ARE’ section for contact details.
