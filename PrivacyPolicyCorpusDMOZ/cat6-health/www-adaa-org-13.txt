The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) launched an exciting new initiative “Turning a Laser-Focus on Women's Issues in the Treatment of Anxiety, Depression and Related Disorders” upon receipt of the Hope and Grace grant in the fall of 2017. The overall goal of the project is to connect women to specialized treatment and foster dialogue between women's mental health researchers, clinicians, patients and the public at large. This two-pronged grant-funded project focuses on professional training and public engagement pertaining to research and best practice treatment of anxiety, depression and co-occurring disorders in girls and women. Learn more.
"She Triumphs" is ADAA's Free Bi-Monthly Women's e-Newsletter supported by a grant from the Hope and Grace Fund. This e-newsletter will feature articles, resources, blog posts, webinars, and more for girls/women struggling with anxiety, depression and co-occurring disorders. Read our first issue here!
The Women’s Mental Health Special Interest Group (SIG) creates a place for clinicians and researchers to discuss, debate, and address issues relevant to the understanding and treatment of women suffering from anxiety and depression and related disorders. Learn more here.
Anxiety
Anxiety disorders are real, serious medical conditions - just as real and serious as physical disorders such as heart disease or diabetes. Anxiety disorders are the most common and pervasive mental disorders in the United States. Click here to learn more about women and anxiety.
Depression
Every day, women face many different stressors in both their personal and professional lives. Feeling sad, lonely and scared are normal reactions, however, for individuals who are diagnosed with depression, these feelings tend to be more severe as they persist. Click here to learn more about women and depression.
Body Dysmorphic Disorder
Most of us have something we don't like about our appearance — a crooked nose, an uneven smile, or eyes that are too large or too small. And though we may fret about our imperfections, they don’t interfere with our daily lives. But people who have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) think about their real or perceived flaws for hours each day. Click here to learn more about BDD.
Eating Disorders
Eating disorders are illnesses that involve irregular eating habits and a severe concern about body weight, shape or overall appearance. They affect both genders, although rates among women and girls are 2.5 times greater than among men and boys. Transgender individuals experience eating disorders at rates significantly higher than cisgender individuals (Diemer et al., 2015). Click here to learn more about eating disorders.
Girls and Teens
Anxiety, depression, and other co-occurring disorders can occur in both genders but during the teenage years, girl are at a higher risk than boys. Click here to learn more about mental health in young girls and teens.
Perinatal Mood Disorders
Perinatal mood disorders are related to mood and anxiety symptoms that occur during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum. Depression that occurs during pregnancy or within a year after delivery is called perinatal depression. Researchers believe that depression is one of the most common complications during and after pregnancy. According to PostPartum Support International, while many women experience some mild mood changes during or after the birth of a child, 15 to 20% of women experience more significant symptoms of depression or anxiety. Click here to learn more about perinatal mood disorders.
Postpartum Disorders
Following childbirth, other known as "postpartum", women may experience postpartum disorders that can affect their mental health. The high hormonal changes and fluctuations that occur during and after childbirth could cause mothers to feel intense mood swings called "the baby blues" which affects 80% of mothers. Click here to learn more about postpartum disorders.
Perimenopause-related Mood Disorders
Women have an increased risk for depression as they transition to menopause. The time period before menopause is "perimenopause" and it represents the passage from reproductive to non-reproductive life. Click here to learn more about perimenopause and depression.
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PPD)
Many women may experience transient physical and emotional changes around the time of their period1. These symptoms are usually mild and tolerable but when it becomes uncontrollable and debilitating, it may interfere with a woman's quality of life. Click here to learn more about PMS and PPD.
Senior Women
According to the CDC, it is estimated that 20% of people age 55 years or older experience some type of mental health concern including anxiety, mood disorders, and severe cognitive impairment. While depressive symptoms tend to increase with age, depression is not a normal part of growing older. Click here to learn more about mental health in senior women.
