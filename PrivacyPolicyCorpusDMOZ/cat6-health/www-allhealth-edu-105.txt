Foot & Ankle Pain
Walking, standing, driving, moving – your feet and ankles keep you going all day. Foot and ankle pain, whether from an injury or normal wear and tear, can affect your ability to function. But you don’t have to live with the pain.

Treatments for foot and ankle pain
The treatments that are most effective for you depend on the diagnosis and symptoms. We explain all of your options and tailor care to meet your unique needs.
Your treatment may include:
Bracing: Wearing a device (brace) limits movement in your foot or ankle, allowing the area to rest. Bracing helps reduce the swelling and promotes healing.
Medication: You may feel better with over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen. For stubborn pain, we may recommend prescription medication.
Injections: If other medications are not working, injecting medications directly into the source of the pain may help you get relief. Learn more about injections.
Physical therapy: Our certified physical therapists help you strengthen the muscles in your foot or ankle. We also show you how to gently stretch the area to relieve stiffness. Read more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
Surgery: If other treatments fail to bring relief, a surgical procedure may be the most effective treatment option. These procedures include repairing or removing damaged tissue. If you have suffered a severe fracture (broken bone), you may need reconstructive surgery. We discuss the procedure with you so you know what to expect during the surgery and recovery. Find out more about orthopaedic surgery.
Preventive services: We offer many services, including strength training, to help you feel your best as you recover. These services may also lower your risk for future foot or ankle problems. Read more about sports performance services.
