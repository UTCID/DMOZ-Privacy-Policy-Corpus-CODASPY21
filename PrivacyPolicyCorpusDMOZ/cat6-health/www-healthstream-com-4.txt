HEALTHSTREAM AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, AND ACCURACY, AS WELL AS ALL WARRANTIES ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.

15.
Limitation on Actions; Waiver.
You agree that any dispute arising out of these Terms or your use of this Site must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by HealthStream to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
16.
Binding Arbitration.
Please read this provision of the Terms of Use carefully.
You have the right to reject the Binding Arbitration terms as set forth in this section. If you reject, your access to and use of the Site will no longer be subject to an arbitration provision. You can reject arbitration by contacting us at 500 11th Avenue, North, Suite 1000, Nashville, TN 37203, Attn: Legal Department stating that you would like to reject the arbitration provision. To be effective, your email must be sent within thirty (30) days of your access to and use of the Site. We will not terminate your access to and use of the Site if you reject this arbitration provision. You do not have the right to reject any other provisions in this Agreement.
This section provides that disputes between you and us may be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court, have a jury trial or initiate or participate in a class action. In arbitration, disputes are resolved by an arbitrator, not a judge or jury. This Binding Arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and shall be interpreted in the broadest way the law will allow.
(a) Covered Claims
You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Site requires that the claim be resolved exclusively by confidential binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Intellectual Property Rights, HealthStream may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief.
(b) Arbitration Limits
No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding.
BECAUSE THE USE OF THIS SITE REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATORS' DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
(c) Administration
The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as then in effect.
The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee, or to any Federal Court located within the State of Tennessee for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim, or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any action by registered mail or any other means provided by law. Should this Section 16 be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, it shall be severed and the parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in the state or federal courts in Tennessee.
(d) Paying for Arbitration Fees
Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. Except for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law. The parties shall equally share all AAA charges and fees associated with the arbitration.
17.
General.
(a) Severability
If any provision in these Terms is found by a court or arbitrator to be invalid, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
(b) No Waiver
HealthStream’s failure to act with respect to a breach by any visitor using this Site does not constitute a waiver of its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
(c) Choice of Law; Jurisdiction and Venue
These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to its choice-of-law provisions. In the event of any conflict between foreign laws, rules, and regulations and those of the United States, the laws, rules and regulations of the United States will govern.
(d) Entire Agreement
These Terms and the Privacy Statement as posted from time to time by HealthStream on this Site, and any modifications to the foregoing, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter in these Terms and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, as to the subject matter.
(e) No Assignment
These Terms and all of your rights and obligations under it are not assignable or transferrable by you without the prior written consent of HealthStream. We may, at any time, sell, transfer, or assign any or all of our rights and obligations under these Terms.
(f) No Third-Party Beneficiaries
You acknowledge that this Site and these Terms are for your exclusive benefit and convenience. Neither can be transferred to any other person and no other person may claim rights under these Terms. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting, vesting, creating or conferring any right of action upon any other third party. This provision is not intended to limit or impair the rights that any person may have under applicable Federal statutes.
18. Contact Information.
