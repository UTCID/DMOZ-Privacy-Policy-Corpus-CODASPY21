Website Usage Information
We may collect information automatically about the use of the Website, through, for example, “cookies” or “IP addresses” (as described below). Best Diet Tips also archives log files and uses non-personally identifying information in aggregate form to detect errors with the Website, identify security issues, build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of Best Diet Tips users, and measure demographics and interests in connection with specific areas of the Website. We may provide such statistical data to our advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. For example, we may inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their websites. We also use such data to create a more enjoyable experience for our users, for example, to assist in selecting content and advertisers featured on specific channels, pages and site areas based on your general likes and dislikes.
“Cookies” are small files websites place on your hard drive that allow websites to identify you. For example, if you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard drive. We may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you when you visit the Website. We may use cookies to measure Website traffic, to offer you certain services, or to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.
Use of Contractors and Service Providers
Best Diet Tips uses third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your Personal Information to them. For example, Best Diet Tips may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our services, to send information to you, to host the Website and related databases, and to perform other work that we may choose to outsource. Best Diet Tips requires these third parties to use your Personal Information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.
Best Diet Tips uses technology provided by a third party to serve ads when you visit the Website. This technology may use information about your visit to the Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Best Diet Tips customizes the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you knowingly provide; (ii) geographic location which Best Diet Tips determines through your IP address; (iii) data Best Diet Tips receives from third parties and (iv) your behavior on the Website or other sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Website, such third party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
Best Diet Tips may also use a third party ad network provider to help present advertisements on the Website. The ad network provider, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Website, may use cookies, web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies (i) to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites, (ii) to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, (iii) to avoid sending you duplicative advertisements and (iv) to understand the usage patterns of people who see advertisements. In doing so, the ad network provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. The ad network provider may connect information about your visit on the Website with information about your visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Website or any other sites on the internet if such other sites also have a relationship with the ad network provider.
The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by third party ad network providers is governed by each ad network provider’s specific privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.
Company Family
We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any current or future “affiliate” (which means a parent company, a subsidiary, joint venture, or other company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Best Diet Tips), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires Best Diet Tips (or a business unit of Best Diet Tips that uses your Personal Information), the Personal Information collected by Best Diet Tips will be transferred to that company and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Security
We use a combination of multiple firewalls and multiple levels of physical security to protect the Personal Information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt your password when it is submitted to us in order to protect the Personal Information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, you should know that no company, including Best Diet Tips, can fully eliminate security or other risks associated with the possession of Personal Information. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information and password.
