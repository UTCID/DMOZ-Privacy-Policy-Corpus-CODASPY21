If you have such information that you want to keep proprietary or private, please do not submit it to us via email.
Non-personal Information – Cookies
Please be advised that even if you do not register for an account on this site, we may still collect non-personal information about you. Non-personal information refers to information that can’t be used to contact you or identify you. We sometimes also obtain such information from external sources. While you can use the site without registering, doing so may limit your ability to make full use of all of its features.
Non-personal information about your use of our website is collected using cookies and Web beacons. Cookies are data files that are kept on the hard drive of the computer you use to access a website. Every computer that accesses this site is assigned a unique cookie.
Web beacons are image files that are embedded in a webpage. They’re usually used to monitor activity on a page and to transmit it to a main server. Information about your Web browser that’s culled from such activity may include the URL of the page that’s being visited, the IP address of your computer or other device, the type of browser that’s being used and the ID number of cookies that are stored on your computer. Please be advised that non-personal information may be shared with third parties, in particular to help us support advertisers on this site.
Non-personal Information Gathered by Third Parties
Your non-personal information is not only shared with third parties acting on behalf of this site; it is also shared with and may be used by sponsors or advertisers on this site. Such sponsors and advertisers may use their own web beacons, cookies or other online tracking technologies in their advertisements, newsletters or special promotions. The companies our sponsors and advertisers use are known as ad servers, and they may collect non-personal information about you through these elements as well.
Please be advised that we do not control the way in which third parties use Web beacons or cookies. We also have no control over how they use or manage the non-personal information that they collect. However, we have an advertising policy that expressly prohibits such third parties from collecting personal information from you without your consent or from linking non-personal information to personal information.

If you have registered in the past and want the information you provided to be deleted from our system, please email or call us via the contact information at the bottom of this policy. We will then delete your information from our current databases and, whenever possible, from our backup devices as well. Please note that it is not technologically possible to completely remove every piece of information that you have provided to us.
