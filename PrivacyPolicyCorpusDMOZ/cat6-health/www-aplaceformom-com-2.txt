OUR SERVICES
A Place for Mom is a senior housing and care marketing and information service that provides resources and personalized assistance in finding senior housing and care. We help families find options based on a loved one's stated needs and preferences and empower them to make informed decisions. This may include independent living, home care, residential care homes, assisted living, specialized memory care, and skilled nursing. Based on the family's stated needs and preferences, we provide the family with information about contracted communities ("Participating Communities") and we forward the family's information to those Participating Communities. Families can review detailed information about local and national Participating Communities, and get personalized, knowledgeable assistance by telephone from an APFM Senior Living Advisor. The service is offered at no charge to families as the Participating Communities pay a fee to APFM. PARTICIPATING SENIOR HOUSING AND/OR CARE COMMUNITIES
The Participating Communities are solely responsible for evaluating, accepting (or declining, as appropriate), and caring for all residents, including, without limitation, ensuring that their staff are appropriately qualified, current on education, and possess the necessary facilities, resources, and equipment to competently provide the services and care required by its residents. Each Participating Community is responsible for the conditions at its community and the training of and acts and omissions of its employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individual who works at or for a community. Each Participating Community is responsible for the content of the information posted on its page or on the Sites. The information does not represent our views or any individual associated with us, and we do not control this content. We do not vouch for the accuracy or completeness of any of the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites, and do not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites. By using the Sites and/or Services, you assume all associated risks. NO ENDORSEMENT; NO AFFILIATION; NOT A BROKER
We exercise no independent judgment as to the quality of, nor do we recommend or endorse, any Participating Community. We provide only an information service and do not (1) place the consumer in any Participating Community, (2) perform any medical assessment of or for the consumer or the Participating Community, or (3) participate in the consumer's and Participating Community's decision regarding final selection or admittance. Further, we are not a representative of or agent for either the consumer or the Participating Community and do not act on either's behalf. It is the responsibility solely of the Participating Community and the potential resident, and/or the potential resident's family and care provider(s) and/or other involved parties acting on the potential resident's behalf to determine if any person is an appropriate admission to the Participating Community. APFM does not broker, sell, or lease space directly and is not a party to any transaction between the provider and the family. NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

Please read the following important section carefully. Except for small claims disputes or claims related to intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to the Sites or Services resolved in court. Instead, disputes relating in any way to the Sites or Services must be submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS.

The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference. You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the Sites or our Services is personal to you and us and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area.

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.
