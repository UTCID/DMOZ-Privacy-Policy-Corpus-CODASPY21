Privacy Policy
Our Twelfth Tradition states, “Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.” We believe in supporting the spirit of our tradition of personal anonymity on the Internet by stating clearly that we do not employ any technical means to track or identify any individual visitor to this website; except for a visit counter, which will be used solely to monitor the success of the Recovery Coast Area website.
Any communication(s) submitted to napasco.org e-mail accounts will be treated with confidentiality and anonymity in mind. We will delete all communications received on a regular basis. We do not guarantee total anonymity in all circumstances. We suggest that the senders of e-mail or feedback forms take their own precautions if they desire to remain anonymous.
All communications considered to be official NA business may require some level of identification for the purposes of responding to those communications. All efforts will be made to pass on communications in a timely manner to a responsible trusted servant. Under no circumstances will we forward e-mail of a personal nature to any NA member here in the Recover Coast Area. This is an official website of the Recovery Coast Area of Narcotics Anonymous and we do not acknowledge anyone’s membership in Narcotics Anonymous. Thank you for respecting this policy.
The policy outlined here will evolve in the future as the guidelines and policies for our website are changed at the direction of the Recovery Coast Area of Narcotics Anonymous.
