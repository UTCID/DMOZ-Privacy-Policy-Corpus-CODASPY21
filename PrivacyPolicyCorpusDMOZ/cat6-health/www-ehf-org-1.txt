Applications will not be accepted in any other way.5.2     Applications for each application round must be submitted by the closing date for that application round set out on the Website. The EHF Selection team may, at its sole discretion, provide a grace period after the closing date for late applications to be allowable due to technical difficulties or other mitigating circumstances.  5.3     If you submit an Application after the closing date for an application round, we will review that Application as part of the subsequent application round, unless you state otherwise in your Application, or withdraw your Application as set out in these Terms. 5.4     You will need to create a user account using your legal name to submit an Application.

You must endeavour to respond to these requests in a timely manner.  We may take your clarifications and additional information into account in evaluating your Application. 5.9     Once you have submitted an Application, you may upload additional Application Materials only:a     in response to a request from us under paragraph 8; orb     if your circumstances change materially, with the potential to materially impact your Application (including where your Application may be liable to be eliminated under paragraph 14.1).5.10     Additional Application Materials provided by you other than as set out in paragraph 9 will not be considered as a part of your Application. 5.11     You may not change any Application Materials after you have submitted them to us.5.12     We may decide to defer evaluation of your Application to an application round other than the round that you have applied for. In this case, you will not be required to submit a further Application.  We may however ask you for additional information about any aspect of your Application that may have changed since you submitted the Application. Paragraph 8 will apply to any such request. 5.13     All Application Materials must be in English. If you wish to provide a translation of any document (or part of a document) that is not in English, you must include, with that document, the name of the translator and a copy of the original (untranslated) document.5.14     If you regard any of the information in your Application Materials as commercially sensitive, you should clearly mark it as such. As set out in the Privacy Policy, if we decide to offer a Fellowship to you we will provide the information in your Application to Immigration NZ, but we will not provide information in your Application that you have marked as commercially sensitive to Immigration NZ without your consent.6. FEES6.1     You must pay EHF the Application Fee for each application round for which you submit an Application, at the time you submit the Application.6.2     If we defer your Application under paragraph 5.12, no additional Application Fee is payable. 6.3     You must pay EHF the applicable Offer Acceptance Fee if you are offered and wish to accept your place in the Fellowship. The Offer Acceptance Fee must be paid to EHF before EHF can confirm your place and send you the official EHF acceptance letter that you will need to include with your application to Immigration NZ for a Global Impact Visa. The Offer Acceptance Fee is in consideration for the support and services EHF provides to Fellows during the 3 years that they hold a Global Impact Visa. This includes EHFs support for Fellows NZ permanent residence applications.6.4     There are limited scholarships available to subsidise Acceptance Fees. For further information, please see the Website. 6.5     Application Fees and Offer Acceptance Fees are non-refundable, except to the extent required to be refunded by law or in accordance with our agreements with Stripe and Paypal, our payment service providers (see https://stripe.com/nz/legal and https://www.paypal.com/ad/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full for more details).6.6     Application Fees and Offer Acceptance Fees are charged in New Zealand dollars for applications from New Zealand Citizens and Permanent Residents and in US dollars for all other applicants. If the credit or debit card you use is not a New Zealand dollar or US dollar credit card, the final charge will be converted to the currency of your credit card at the card providers going rate and your card provider may charge additional fees. If we display the Application Fee on the Website in any currency other than New Zealand dollars or US dollars, it is indicative only and we are not liable if the final amount charged to your card differs from the displayed amount. 6.7     If you apply for a Global Impact Visa on acceptance of a place in the Fellowship, a separate fee for the Global Impact Visa will be payable to Immigration NZ. Similarly, a separate fee will be payable to Immigration NZ if you choose to apply for permanent residence. 6.8     Notwithstanding paragraph 6.5, EHF may in its absolute discretion choose (but will not be obliged) to offer a full or partial refund of the Offer Acceptance Fee where you are offered and accept a place in the Fellowship but are not able to take up that place for reasons outside of your control. Without limiting EHFs discretion, a full or partial refund may be considered where, for example, having accepted a Fellowship place and paid the Offer Acceptance Fee, you submit a complete Global Impact Visa application on time but do not meet Immigration NZs criteria around character, health or maintenance funds to receive the Global Impact Visa. In considering whether a full or partial refund will be offered, EHF may take into account factors including, but not limited to, whether your visa has been declined due to reasons that could reasonably have been expected and the extent to which you have already benefited from EHF events, platforms and services. You should not expect to receive a refund if you have failed to submit a complete Global Impact Visa application on time, dont engage with the Fellowship, are asked to leave the Fellowship, or if you dont qualify to receive EHFs letter of support towards any future Permanent Residence Visa application.7. WITHDRAWING AN APPLICATION7.1     You may withdraw your Application through the user account you used to lodge your application on www.ehf.org and by following instructions provided on the application portal. 7.2     If you withdraw your Application, you may resubmit your Application in a subsequent application round.8.
