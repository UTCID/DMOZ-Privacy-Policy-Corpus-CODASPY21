Client Services Policy
Muscular Dystrophy Australia (MDA) has developed and grown
its service capabilities as a direct result of client input and demand.
Since inception in 1984, MDA’s success, as a not-for-profit organisation
is attributed, to a combination of the quality of the staff, the Committee of
Management, volunteers and other interested parties. Both individual
and collective input has contributed to the positive evolution of this
organisation.
