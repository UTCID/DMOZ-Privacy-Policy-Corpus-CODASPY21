Your Individual Privacy Right as a Patient includes the following:
Inspection and Copy: You may make a request in writing to review or order a copy of your health record, with the exception of information protected by law. However, we ask that you obtain your report from your ordering physician before we will make a copy available to you. MRA limits your health records to films, reports and billing information of imaging procedures you received. MRA has the right to ask you for this request in writing and we will respond within a reasonable time frame. There may also be a reasonable charge for copies.
Confidentiality: You have the right to make a request in writing that MRA provide you with your health information. If you request that we mail information to another address, we will agree to your request to the extent we are able to assure accuracy in doing so.
Restrict Use and Disclosure: You have the right to make a request in writing that MRA not use health information in certain ways or for certain purposes. You may also request that we not provide health information to certain individuals. However, MRA has the right to refuse your request, particularly as the law requires.

If your request is denied, you may write a statement of disagreement with the denial that we will keep with your health information.

Privacy Violations: If you feel your health information privacy rights have been violated, you may file a complaint with MRA’s contact person listed below or with the Secretary of Health and Humans Services.
