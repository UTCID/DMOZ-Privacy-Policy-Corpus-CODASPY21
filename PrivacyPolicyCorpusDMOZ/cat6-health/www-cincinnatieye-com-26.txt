Last Updated: November 12, 2020
Neuro-opthalmologists are able to evaluate and diagnose a variety of medical conditions with a neurology, ophthalmology and medical perspective.
Some of the disorders treated by neuro-ophthalmologists include:
Optic nerve conditions
Myasthenia gravis
Thyroid disease
Temporary or permanent loss of vision
Pseudotumor cerebri
Orbital and intracranial tumor
Stroke
Double or blurry vision
Visual perception disorder
Headache or migraine
Trauma
Post-neurosurgical procedure complications
Demyelenation
Neuro-ophthalmology specialists can determine what is causing a particular vision problem as well as whether it is due to a medical condition or a problem within the nervous system or optic nerve.
Neuro-Ophthalmic Symptoms
Symptoms associated with these and other neuro-ophthalmic disorders usually include:
Vision loss
Disturbances in vision
Diplopia
Eyelid and facial spasms
Sudden vision loss can be caused by tumors or aneurysms that need to be treated immediately. It can also be caused by an obstruction of blood vessels in the optic nerve or retina.
Neuro-Ophthalmic Diagnostic Procedures
Diagnosis and treatment of neuro-ophthalmic disorders may be conducted through a series of tests and therapies. Diagnostic evaluation services often include:
Fundus photography
MRI
CT scan
Ultrasound
Cerebral angiography
Optical coherence tomography
A neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation is a detailed and comprehensive examination that lasts between four to six hours. A complete medical history is taken. The doctor will examine the visual field and eye movement and will often perform a complete neurologic exam as well.
