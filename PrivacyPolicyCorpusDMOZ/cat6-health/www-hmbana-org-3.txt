When you give to HMBANA, you are promoting a world where all infants have access to human milk through support of breastfeeding and use of pasteurized donor human milk.
Together, we advocate for donor milk as a universal standard of care, regardless of ability to pay. Nonprofit milk banking is paving the way.
