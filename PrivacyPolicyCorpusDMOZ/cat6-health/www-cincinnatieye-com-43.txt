Fundus Photography
A fundus photograph is a specialized form of medical imaging. Using a customized camera with high-powered lenses that are mounted to a microscope, photographs are taken of the back of the eye by focusing light through the cornea, pupil and lens. Fundus photographs are used to identify or monitor a wide variety of ophthalmic conditions.
To begin the process, the pupil is dilated with eye drops. The patient will be asked to stare at a fixed device, keeping the eyes focused and still. There will be a series of flashes of light. The process usually takes no more than 10 minutes.
Some of the ophthalmic conditions fundus photography is used for include:
Glaucoma
Diabetic retinopathy
Macular edema
Microaneurysm
Optic nerve
Fundus photography has also been used to interpret the results of a fluorescein angiogram.
