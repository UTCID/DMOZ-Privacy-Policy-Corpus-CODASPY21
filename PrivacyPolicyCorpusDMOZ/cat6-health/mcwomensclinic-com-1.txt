POLICY: COMMUNICATING PROTECTED HEALTH- INFORMATION VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL (EMAIL)
PURPOSE:
This policy describes procedures that govern an individual’s use of the Mid Cities Women’s Clinic’s (MCWC’S) email system. It also defines the steps that must be taken by MCWC’s clients who wish to engage in email with MCWC. This policy applies to the informational uses of email.
This policy applies to MCWC’s personnel and other persons affiliated with or authorized by MCWC to read, create, store, respond, or transmit information via a MCWC email system (Users). This policy also applies only to the use of email for both internal and external communications of PHI.
POLICY:
MCWC will permit email of unencrypted Protected Health Information (PHI) under limited circumstances where the appropriate safeguards described herein are applied.
Note: For the purpose of this policy, the term “Mid Cities Women’s Clinic (MCWC) electronic mail systems” does not refer to the physical location of the email system but its use by MCWC personnel to transmit PHI.
PROCEDURES:
Communicating PHI via Email Internally
ü As a general rule, unencrypted email should not be used to communicate PHI.
ü Email is inherently less secure than other forms of communication. However,
email of PHI will be permitted at MCWC if certain safeguards are
implemented.
ü MCWC will implement the following safeguards when communicating PHI in or attached to an email message:
Email communications containing PHI about MCWC clients will be transmitted only on a MCWC email system and cannot be forwarded to an email account outside MCWC.
PHI will not be transmitted in the subject line of the email message.
The email message will include the following confidentiality notice.
PHI that is specially protected (i.e., HIV/AIDS information, substance abuse treatment information, and mental health information) will not be communicated via email.
If a document that contains PHI is attached to the message, the User should verify before transmitting the email message that he/she has attached the proper attachment.
Before transmitting the email message, Users should double-check the message and any attachments to verify that no unintended information is included.
Users who communicate PHI via email will comply with all other MCWC policies and procedures including, but not limited to, the Confidentiality of PHI Policy and the Minimum Necessary Policy. (See HIPAA Manual)
Any User who is unsure whether an email message or attachment contains PHI should contact his/her supervisor or the HIPAA Privacy Officer before initiating the email communication.
Communicating PHI with Clients
ü Clients have the right to request that MCWC communicate with them via email.
ü If a client requests email communications containing their PHI, the individual receiving the request must obtain a completed Client Request for Email Communications form from the client AND must provide the client with the Important Information about Provider/Client Email form prior to processing the client’s request.
ü Both forms are available at MCWC’s website or located in hard copy at the MCWC’s office.
ü MCWC reserves the right to deny a client’s request to communicate with him/her via email. For example, a client’s request for email communications may be denied by MCWC if the client refuses to sign the Client Request for Email Communications.
ü If the client’s initial request to communicate via email is granted by MCWC, the client will be required to complete the following prior to engaging, for the first time, in licensed healthcare professional/client emails with MCWC:
Respond to a test email with answers to a question specific to that client (i.e., the client’s date of birth, father’s name, mother’s name, etc.) to verify the client’s email address and identity; and
Read and understand the Important Information about Client Email form confirming the client’s understanding of the risks of engaging in email communications with his/her licensed healthcare professional.
No specially protected PHI (i.e., HIV/AIDS information, substance abuse treatment information, and mental health information) will be communicated via email even if the client’s request for email communications is granted.
All completed Request for Email Communications forms will be maintained by the office processing the client’s request for a minimum of six (6) years.
Approved requests are valid regardless of the time period as long as a hard copy of the form is maintained.
An approved Request will be effective for only the Organization identified on the Request.
The client must revoke each Request to discontinue email communications.
Ownership of Electronic Mail
ü The email systems at MCWC belong to MCWC, and are password protected.
ü MCWC’s personnel will adhere to this policy when sending PHI and MCWC’s email policy when sending email that doesn’t contain PHI.
ü MCWC reserves the right to override individual passwords and access the email system at any time for valid business purposes such as system maintenance and repair and security investigations.
Retention of Email
Once email has been printed and filed in a client’s chart, the email is to be deleted.
Definitions
User means any personnel or other person authorized by MCWC to read, enter or update information created or transmitted via the electronic mail system.
Protected Health Information (PHI) means information, including demographic information that may identify the client, that relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an individual or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual and identifies or could reasonably be used to identify the individual.
Personnel means employees, volunteers, trainees, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for MCWC, is under the direct control of MCWC, whether or not they are paid by MCWC.

Important Information about Client Email
As a Client at Mid Cities Women’s Clinic (MCWC), you may request we communicate with you by electronic mail (email). This Fact Sheet will inform you about the risks of communicating with MCWC via email and how MCWC will use and disclose organization/ Client email.
PLEASE READ THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY
As a Client at Mid Cities Women’s Clinic (MCWC), you may request we communicate with you by electronic mail (email). This Fact Sheet will inform you about the risks of communicating with MCWC via email and how MCWC will use and disclose MCWC/ Client email.
Mid Cities Women’s Clinic’s preferred method of communication is by telephone. Email will be used if unable to contact by phone at clients written request.
Email communications are two-way communications. However, responses and replies to emails sent to or received by either you or MCWC may be hours or days apart. This means that there could be a delay in receiving results or answers to questions that you may have regarding your condition.
If you have an urgent or an emergency situation, you should not rely solely on MCWC/Client email to request assistance or to describe the urgent or emergency situation. Instead, you should act as though MCWC/Client email is not available to you – and seek assistance by means consistent with your needs.
Email messages on your computer, your laptop, and/or your phone have inherent privacy risks – especially when your email access is provided through your employer or when access to your email messages is not password protected.
Unencrypted email provides as much privacy as a postcard. You should not communicate any information with MCWC that you would not want to be included on a postcard that is sent through the Post Office.
Email messages may be inadvertently missed. You can help minimize this risk by using only the email address that you have provided on your consent form to communicate with MCWC.
Email is sent at the touch of a button. Once sent, an email message cannot be recalled or cancelled. Errors in transmission, regardless of the sender’s caution, can occur.
In order to forward or to process and respond to your email, individuals at MCWC other than your licensed healthcare professional may read your email message. Your email message is not a private communication between you and your licensed healthcare professional.
Neither you nor the person reading your email can see the facial expressions or gestures or hear the voice of the sender. Email can be misinterpreted.
It is the policy of MCWC that your email messages and any and all responses to them become part of your medical record.
