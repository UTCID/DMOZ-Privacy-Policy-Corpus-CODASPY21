Re-requisitioning Policy
Ambry's re-requisitioning policy allows you to test for additional genes without the need for a new sample. This can be beneficial when a patient’s medical history strongly indicates hereditary disease, but the initial test report was negative. Newly available information about your patient’s personal or family medical history may also suggest the need to analyze additional genes post-reporting.
Re-requisitioning allows you to gather additional information at no additional charge, so that you can provide the best patient care.
Upon completion of a re-requisition order, a new final report will be provided that includes results for all of the genes tested. In most cases, results will be available in less than 2 weeks and no new samples will be required.
Who is eligible?
Re-requisition testing and additional reporting are completed at no charge for cases that meet the following criteria:
The initial test order was one of Ambry’s Plus, Next, or First cardiology or cancer multi gene panel tests
The re-requisitioning order is for genes within the same specialty as the original test
Additional testing must be ordered within 60 days of the original report date
Excludes paired tumor/germline testing options
