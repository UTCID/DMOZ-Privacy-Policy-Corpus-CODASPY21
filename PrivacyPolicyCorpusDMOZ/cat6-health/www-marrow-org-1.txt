The NMDP recommends that you discuss your specific, individual health concerns with your doctor or health care professional. The materials and discussions presented here describe current treatment options and drugs or treatments that may be under study, and are for informational purposes only. Treatment options or donation procedures should be determined by an individual and his or her treating doctor based on the individual's overall health, age, disease, disease stage, and, if transplant is being considered as a treatment option, the availability of a suitably matched adult donor or umbilical cord blood unit. RegistrationCertain functions of the NMDP Website require registration, such as joining the federally authorized registry of the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, administered by the NMDP (referred to here as the Registry). In consideration of your use of this Website, you agree that if you register on this Website, you will provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself and will maintain and update such information promptly if any of it changes. You agree that if any information you provide is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, the NMDP may prohibit your access to sections of the Website requiring registration. The NMDP may also reject your application to become a member of the Be The Match Registry®.You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and agree not to allow anyone else to use your user name or password to access this Website. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. You agree to immediately notify the NMDP of any unauthorized use of your password or user name or any other breach of security of which you become aware. You may not register with a user name or e-mail address that is already being used by someone else or that belongs to another person, unless you have his or her consent. The NMDP may refuse to accept a user name for registration if someone else has already registered with that user name or for any other reason at its own discretion.You agree that the NMDP may access, preserve and disclose your registration information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that it is necessary to: Respond to your requests for customer service;Comply with legal process;Enforce these Terms of Use;Respond to claims that information you have provided violates the rights of others;

This is to cover the cost of tissue typing and storage, as well as materials and administrative expenses.If you are age 18–44, Be The Match covers the cost to join through funds provided in part by generous mission supporters.If you are age 45–60, you will be required to make a $100 payment to cover the cost to join. The reason: Younger donors, ages 18–44, produce more and higher-quality blood stem cells that lead to better transplant outcomes. Transplant physicians request younger donors 85 percent of the time. Requiring individuals ages 45–60 to cover their own cost to join helps Be The Match maintain the best registry for patients and make the best use of its resources. Rules of ConductWhile using the Website, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
