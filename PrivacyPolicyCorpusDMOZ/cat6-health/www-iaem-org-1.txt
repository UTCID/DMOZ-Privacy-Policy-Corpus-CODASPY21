Internet/Sales/Privacy Policies
Internet Policy, Sales and Privacy Policy
IAEM Consumer Data Privacy, Member Contact Information, Secure Method of Transmission, Return Policy, and Shipping Policy
Consumer Data Privacy Policy
The International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM) created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our visitors' privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services.
We collect visitors' contact information, including email addresses and financial information. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to customers. The customer’s contact information is used for communicating with our customers on related issues. We may send mailings through the U.S. Postal Service or other standard carrier to the address that a customer provides.
Financial information that is collected is used to bill the purchaser for products or services.
All information submitted is considered confidential in nature and will not be disclosed to anyone except under a subpoena in a court of law.
Member Contact Information
Member contact information may be distributed by IAEM Headquarters to a third party for list rental. Members may opt out by checking the “exclude contact information” box in their online member profile.
Please be aware that official IAEM Board and member lists are the property of IAEM, and they may not be used without permission. Duplication of member contact information is strictly prohibited.
Please email info@iaem.com if you would like more details about how to access our lists on a rental basis. You also may be interested in other opportunities to make IAEM participants aware of your products and services – monthly print and electronic newsletter advertising, exhibit displays at gatherings of more than 2,500 practitioners, and more.
Event Privacy and Photography/Recording Consent
By registering for and by your presence at any IAEM event (Conferences, Board, Committee, Commission, other group meetings, or any events offered by the association), you consent to be photographed, filmed, videotaped and/or otherwise recorded. Your registration constitutes your consent to such photography, filming and/or recording and to any use, in any and all media throughout the universe in perpetuity, of your appearance, voice and name for any purpose whatsoever in connection with the IAEM event. You understand that all photography, filming and/or recording will be done in reliance upon this consent given by you by entering the event facilities (conference rooms, board rooms, exhibit halls, convention centers, and any other venue chosen for the activity). If you do not agree to the foregoing, please do not enter the event facilities.
Secure Method of Transmission
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your financial information before it is sent. This sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our website, making it useless to anyone but IAEM and software service contractor Integrated Software Solutions, Inc. (ISS).
Return Policy
Your satisfaction is guaranteed. IAEM merchandise sold through the online store may be returned for credit on the card used for purchase. IAEM memberships and certification payments are non-refundable. Meeting cancellations are subject to the individual cancellation policies established for the meeting.
Shipping Policy
We ship our products via the U.S. Postal Service or other standard carrier.
