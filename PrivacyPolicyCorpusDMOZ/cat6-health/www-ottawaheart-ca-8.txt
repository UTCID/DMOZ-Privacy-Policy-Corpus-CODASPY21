Do you know how to sew? The Heart Institute needs your help again.
In April, we put out a call on our website and on social media asking our surrounding community for donations of hand-sewn cloth masks. We sincerely thank everyone for their help. As mentioned in Sew Much Love for Ottawa Heart Patients: A Thank You to Our Community, we received thousands of donated masks and we are all so grateful to have received the support from the community.
As we are running low on masks to give to our patients, we are asking for your help again. If you sew and have time, we ask that you please consider giving your time to sew and donate masks to our patients.
For more information on how to safely sew and donate masks to the Heart Institute, please download the following document:
Making Homemade Masks for University of Ottawa Heart Institute Patients (PDF)
For questions, please send an email to the Department of Communications.
Thank you for helping us keep our patients safe.
