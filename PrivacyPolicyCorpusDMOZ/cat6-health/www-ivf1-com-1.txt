PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
At Naperville Fertility Center, we respect your privacy and will protect your health information responsibly and professionally in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its rules, as well as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”) and the HITECH Act Final Rule of 2013 which amended HIPAA.
We’re required to maintain the privacy of your health information and to provide you with this Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”).
Also, we’re required to abide by the terms of the Notice that’s currently in effect.
We reserve the right to change the terms of this Notice and to make the new Notice provisions effective for all PHI we maintain.
If we change this Notice, the revised Notice will be posted in our facilities, offices, and on our website (www.npvfertilitycenter.com) and (www.ivf1.com), or a copy of the revised Notice will be mailed to you.
This Notice applies to all patients of Naperville Fertility Center and Randy Morris, M.D.
It describes how we may collect, use, and disclose your health information, and your rights.

We will not use or disclose genetic information of an individual for underwriting purposes.
