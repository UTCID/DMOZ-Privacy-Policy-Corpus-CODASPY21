Terms and Conditions
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES,
LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, A CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS. THESE PROVISIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF OUR AGREEMENT.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY ABLE
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
Universities.com (“Universities.com” or “Us”) owns and operates this website (the “Site”).
Scope and Application
This Agreement applies to your use of our Site. You—the party entering information (“You”)—are entering into
a legally binding Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Universities.com, including our Privacy Policy, which is
incorporated by reference.
We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to add to, delete, or modify our Agreement,
Privacy Policy, and any part of our Site. We will notify You of changes to the Privacy Policy
by posting the new terms on the Site and if You use our Site after the date the changes
are effective, You agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. If we make any substantive
changes to the Agreement, You must expressly consent to the new terms.
Terms of Agreement
You consent to being contacted by Universities.com and Degree Scout at the number or email You provided. You also consent to receiving advertisements
and telemarketing messages by email, text message or pre-recorded call, either
of which may be dialed by an auto-dialer. You acknowledge that Your
consent is not required for purchase and that standard message
and data rates apply.
Representations
You represent and warrant that the information provided by You up is up-to-date, materially accurate,
and is sufficient for Us to identify You and contact You.
Each party represents and warrants to the other that it has full right and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder; that its execution and performance
of this Agreement will not breach any agreement between itself and a third party;
and that the provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and enforceable against
it except as may be limited by applicable United States bankruptcy laws and
other laws affecting creditor’s rights.
Arbitration and Waiver of Class Claims
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND US, ANY AFFILIATED,
SUBSIDIARY, OR RELATED COMPANIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, CLAIMS BASED
UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDER, ORDINANCE, OR REGULATION, AND THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY,
SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET BELOW. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE
AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR PRIVATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE
OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY
TRIAL. ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE
ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY THE COURT. JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE
ENTERED BY A CALIFORNIA STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THIS ARBITRATION
CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION,
ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”).
The following procedures shall apply:
Any party that intends to make a claim shall first notify the opposing party
in writing of such intention and shall describe in such notice, with reasonable particularity,
the nature and basis of such claim, and the total amount of the claim. Within thirty (30)
days of receipt of such notice, the party receiving notice of a claim shall provide a written
response which, with reasonable particularity, sets forth its position concerning the claim.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from the claim by good faith
negotiations to be conducted within the thirty (30)-day period following the written
response, either of them may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth below.
In the event a party elects to proceed with binding arbitration, it shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party by registered or certified mail. The arbitration
shall be conducted by Judicate West, and shall be conducted using the then current Judicate
West commercial rules and regulations (except as varied by this agreement). The arbitration
shall take place in San Diego County, California, but may proceed telephonically in
the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses).
Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above, the parties hereby
independently waive any right to bring or participate in any class action in any way related
to, or arising from, this Agreement.

Governing Law
Our Agreement and Your use of our Site shall be construed, governed by and enforced under the
substantive laws of the State of California applicable to parties resident in and contracts made,
executed and wholly performed within the State of California. You submit to the jurisdiction of
the State and Federal courts situated in San Diego County, California, USA in all disputes
arising out of or related to the use of the Site and You will not object to jurisdiction or
venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum, or otherwise.

WITH ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER THE AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF OUR SITE.
Miscellaneous
The Agreement is the entire agreement You have with us regarding the subject matter
hereof and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings. Our Agreement

an authorized representative of ours. No electronic or digital communication of any
kind is to be construed as a “writing” for purposes of amending or modifying our Agreement
or the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder. The illegality, unenforceability
or invalidity of any provision is severable and shall not affect or impair the rest of our
Agreement. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver
of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no
waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of
the waiving party. You shall not assign, transfer, charge, or make over or purport to assign
transfer charge to make over Your rights under this Agreement. Any purported assignment shall

that must survive any termination of Your agreement with us in order to allow us to enforce
its meaning shall survive. You may not make or initiate any demand, claim, or action against
us, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, more than one (1) year after the cause of
action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause arose). If we
believe, have reason to believe, or are notified of anything that could compromise or endanger
the health or safety of any person, could cause damage (tangible or intangible), could
adversely affect, infringe upon or misappropriate anyone else’s rights, harasses, or
interferes with any other user, interferes with or bypasses security or other protective
measures, violates any law or regulation or this Agreement, we have the right, reserving
cumulatively all other rights and remedies available to us at law, in equity and under
our agreement with You, to report and provide information to any and all regulatory and
law enforcement authorities and agencies and take any action permitted by law. Nothing
herein or on the Site should be understood as granting You a license to use any of the
trademarks, service marks, or logos owned by us or by any third party. We make no representation
that any of the materials or the services to which You have been given access are available
or appropriate for use outside the United States and access to the Site from territories where
its contents are illegal or restricted is prohibited. If You choose to access the Site from
outside the United States, You do so on Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance
with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
