COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal Information
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonably available means. Personal Information does not include business contact information that is used for the purpose of communicating or facilitating communication with an individual in relation to their employment, business, or profession. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the meaning of Personal Information shall be interpreted in a manner that conforms with the minimum requirements of applicable privacy legislation.
Collection, Use and Disclosure
The types of Personal Information that we may collect from time to time may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, contact details, financial, credit or billing information, demographic details, and other personally identifiable information.
Some of our services, websites, and apps require you to register. Newcom may ask you for some personal identifying information in order to create an account (typically e-mail address and/or a password for your account).
When you register for one of our products (site membership, trade show attendance, newsletter subscriptions, etc.), our forms may ask for contact and demographic information. This information is used to allow you to access certain areas of our services, websites and apps that send permission-based products and services to you (that are based on the demographic information), and to advise you of other Newcom products and services. In addition, demographic information may be used: (i) to customize the display of our services, websites, and apps to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past visits; and (ii) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information may be collected through your voluntary disclosure, use of our service, apps, or websites, purchase of our products, subscription to our publications, completion of registration or subscription forms, by means of surveys, entry to a contest or other promotion or through third-party agents, contractors, vendors or suppliers who provide products and services to us ("Service Providers"), as well as through our third-party business partners to whom we provide our products and services.
For the purpose of maintaining quality service, telephone calls to our customer service lines may be recorded. If your call is subject to a quality assurance program, you will be so advised prior to speaking with a representative.
We collect, use and/or disclose your Personal Information for purposes reasonably connected to why you’ve provided it to us, as well as for purposes otherwise permitted or required by law. Some examples of purposes for which we use personal information include the following:
to create and maintain client accounts;
to provide the product, service or information you requested;
to communicate with you regarding the products and services you requested and to respond to your requests and inquiries;
to process payments and collect unpaid accounts;
to offer you tailored content, including advertisements and promotions;
to assist you when you contact our customer support services, including to direct your questions to appropriate individuals, investigate and address any of your concerns, and to improve and monitor our customer support responses;
to detect and protect against error, fraud, theft and other illegal activity;
to better understand your needs and preferences and to improve our products and services;
to engage in business transactions;
to provide information to our employees, contractors, and affiliates to allow them to perform services on our behalf;
to organize and administer contests and/or surveys;
to inform you of special offers and promotions;
to comply generally with applicable laws and all other applicable regulatory requirements; and/or
for any other purpose for which you otherwise give your consent, including as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.
We share non-personal, aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, demographics, traffic patterns, and related site information with advertisers and reputable third-party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes; however, none of the information we disclose in this aggregate form can be used to personally identify you.
Disclosure to Newcom; Disclosure as Permitted or Required by Law
We may: (i) share your personal information with our affiliates; (ii) combine information internally across our affiliates or our different products, services, websites, and apps; and (iii) combine personal information with demographic information, publicly available records and other third-party information sources. We may use this information to provide you with a customized experience, to improve the quality of our products, services, websites, and apps, and to promote and develop products, websites, services, and apps of Newcom, or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.
When you provide Personal Information to us with respect to employment opportunities, including, but not limited to, your resume, we will treat such Personal Information on a confidential basis and use it only: (i) to consider you for current or future employment opportunities within Newcom; and (ii) to contact you with respect to such employment opportunities. We will retain your Personal Information for further employment opportunities that may arise within Newcom, unless you inform us that you no longer want us to retain your information.
We may provide Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personal Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of others and ourselves.
Disclosure to Service Providers
Newcom has operations in both Canada and the United States, as well as in other jurisdictions. We may transfer your Personal Information to Service Providers acting on our behalf for purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. Note that some of our Service Providers who process or handle Personal Information on our behalf may be located in the United States and other jurisdictions outside of Ontario and outside of Canada. You acknowledge and agree that, as a result, your Personal Information may be processed, used, stored or accessed in other jurisdictions and may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions. For example, information may be disclosed in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts, or law enforcement in other countries.
Disclosure in Business Transactions
Newcom may be involved in the proposed or actual sale, merger, financing, securitization, insuring or restructuring of some or all of its business or assets. In the course of such transactions, Newcom may disclose your Personal Information to applicable third parties who request such information for the purposes of evaluating or performing the proposed transactions. In such cases, Newcom will require such third parties to agree to protect the privacy of your Personal Information in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Our successors and assigns may collect, use and disclose your Personal Information for substantially the same purposes as those set out in this Privacy Policy.
CONSENT
We collect, use and disclose your Personal Information with your consent or as permitted or required by applicable law. Your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and applicable laws. By providing Personal Information to us you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information about another person to us, we assume you have obtained the valid consent of such individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your Personal Information, we may not be able to provide you with certain of our services or products.
UNSUBSCRIBE
Any electronic communication that we send you, whether on our behalf or on behalf of our third-party business partners, will include instructions on how to unsubscribe from any such future communications. If you do not consent, please do not provide your Personal Information or, where applicable, exercise opt-out options offered, or send an e-mail to privacy@newcom.ca.
