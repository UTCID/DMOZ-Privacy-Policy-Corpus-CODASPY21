Privacy & Security
The bottom line:
All information gathered is kept strictly confidential and we will not
send you e-mail advertisements.
Visa, Mastercard, Discover, PayPal and Google Payments require basic identification information be
provided to them in order to process a purchase. That is the only information
that we will ever share with a third party. We abide by the Traditions,
and always respect our customer's anonymity.
The specifics:
Information we gather and what we do with it.
We log our users' IP addresses to determine how many
unique visitors we have and to get an idea of what resources are used
most frequently. We also log impersonal demographic information such
as browser type and operating system of users to ensure we keep up with
our users' needs.
Any phone numbers or e-mail addresses collected are
used by us only if we have a specific question in regard to information
you have sent to us. The only exception to this is that on rare occasion
we send out upgrade information to registered users of our computer
programs.
The information we gather is never shared with anyone.
We send out product update information by regular mail
about twice a year. Mail is sent only to those who have requested to
be added to the mailing list or have placed orders with us in the past.
We never sell or share our mailing list with anyone else.
Why it is safe to order from our Web site.
All orders placed with us online are processed on a
secure server.
You will know that it is a secure transaction when
you see a full "lock" in
the status bar at the bottom right of Internet Explorer. If you use
a Netscape browser there will be a yellow keyin
the lower left-hand corner.
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information
you input before it is sent to us. Encryption turns information into
a form that can only be decoded by our web server at the other end of
the connection.
About cookies.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored
by your browser on your computer's hard drive. The only thing our cookies
do is to enable your browser to remember what is in your shopping cart
between pages or visits. Cookies can't tell us who you are and are useless
to anyone but you. Here is the content of a typical cookie:

Pretty boring huh? All it does is assign you a temporary order number
and records numbers to remind the shopping cart what it is you intend
to buy. Our cookies never store personal or credit card information.
A similarly bland cookie is used on our AAquestions discussion forum.
Those cookies store the date of your last visit and the info you used
the last time you posted something. It would look something like this:
