FRIDAY. JENNIFER: BECAUSE IT'S STILL SUMMER. PLENTY OF TIME TO WEAR FLIP FLOPS. THE 11th ANNUAL FLIP-FLOP FESTIVUS IS COMING UP AT THE END OF THIS MONTH AND IT'S ALL TO HELP RAISE MONEY TO FIGHT AGAINST SARCOIDOSIS. JOINING US WITH MORE INFORMATION, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE LIFE AND BREATHE FOUNDATION, SEAN HULL, AND PULMONARY SPECIALIST FROM GBMC, DR. ELIZABETH CARR. >> WHEN IS THE EVENT? >> FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE FOUR SEASONS, SEPTEMBER 20, IN DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE. JENNIFER: WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE EVENT IN A MOMENT. FIRST, THE IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHAT IS SARCOIDOSIS. >> IT'S AN AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER WHERE THE BODY STARTS TO KIND OF ATTACK ITSELF. AND WHEN IT DOES THAT, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S PROTECTING ITSELF FROM. IT CREATES THESE, WHAT WE CALL, GRAN LOMAS WHICH ARE LIKE A PEARL THAT'S CREATED BY AN OYSTER, AND IT HAPPENS ANYWHERE IN THE BODY FROM HEAD TO TOE. THE MOST COMMON PLACES THAT HAPPEN ARE IN THE LUNG, IN THE EYES, AND IN THE SKIN. WE THINK IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT INHALED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. JENNIFER: AFFECTING BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. >> ALL GENDERS, ALL AGES, ALL RACES, MORE COMMONLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN, WOMEN MORE COMMON THAN MEN. AGES 20 TO 40 ARE MOST COMMON. IT'S TYPICALLY MISDIAGNOSED. IT ACTS LIKE ANYTHING. SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE CANCER WHEN THEY HAVE SARCOID. IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT. JENNIFER: SEAN, THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR MOTHER HAD. >> SHE PASSED AWAY IN 1996 WITH TE DISEASE AFTER SUFFERING FOR WHAT WE THINK IS 13 YEARS. I CREATED THE FOUNDATION IN 1998 AND THIS IS OUR 21ST YEAR RAISING AWARENESS. JENNIFER: WHAT DOES THE MONEY GO TOWARD? >> WE'RE PARTNERING WITH GMBC AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN BALTIMORE TO HELP PATIENT NAVIGATE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY CAN GO TO SEEK CARE. DR. CARR TALKED ABOUT MISDIAGNOSIS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WE FIND THAT FREF LENT SO OUR IDEA IS IF WE CAN PROVIDE THAT GATEWAY FOR THE PATIENT TO BE ABLE TO SEE PROFESSIONALS FOR NAVIGATION, COORDINATION OF CARE, THINGS OF THAT NATURE, THEY'LL HAVE A BETTER BATTLE WITH THE DISEASE. JENNIFER: THE EVENT SOUNDS FUN. >> THIS IS THE 11th YEAR OF THE FLIP-FLOP FESTIVUS. IT STARTED OUT TO BE A KICKOFF TO THE NFL SEASON. PERFECT TIMING FOR THE RAVENS AND THEIR GAME TODAY. BUT IT'S A RESORT CASUAL EVENT. AGAIN, ON THE WATER, DOWNTOWN AT THE FOUR SEASONS. AND WE'LL HAVE FOOD, WE'LL HAVE A DEEJAY, LIVE AND SILENT AUCTION ITEMS AND IT'S A FUN TIME FOR US TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR A GOOD DISEASE. >> THESE ARE SOME OF THE AUCTION ITEMS RIGHT HERE? >> WE'LL HAVE TRAVEL PACKAGES, SPORTS THEMED PACKAGES FROM THE RAVENS, THE ORIOLES, THE CAPITALS, AND THE WIZARDS. JENNIFER: TICKETS ARE AVAILABLE. GIVE US THE WEBSITE. >> LIFEANDBREATH.ORG. CA
