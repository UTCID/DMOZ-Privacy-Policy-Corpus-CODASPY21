Smoke & Tobacco Product-Free Policy
As of August 29, 2017 El Centro Regional Medical Center (ECRMC) will be
free of Smoke & Tobacco Products.
ECRMC is eliminating tobacco-use on our properties to provide a healthy
and safe environment for patients, visitors, and employees in addition
to promoting positive health behaviors.
This policy bans the use of all tobacco products, including cigarettes,
cigars, e-cigarettes, pipes and smokeless tobacco, within all properties
owned, leased, or occupied by ECRMC. This includes parking lots, hospital
vehicles, and employees’ personal vehicles parked on the premises.
Employees are prohibited from using tobacco products during working hours.
