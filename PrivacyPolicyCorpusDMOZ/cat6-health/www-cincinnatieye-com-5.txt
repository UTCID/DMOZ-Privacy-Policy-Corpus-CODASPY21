Cataracts
What Are Cataracts?
Cataracts affect millions of people each year, including more than half of all Americans 60 years of age and older. Cataracts are a painless clouding of the eye’s natural lens that is caused by a buildup of protein.
Risk Factors for Developing Cataracts?
In addition to aging, other factors can increase the risk of developing cataracts including the following:
Obesity
Smoking
Diabetes
High blood pressure
Excessive exposure to sunlight
Exposure to radiation
Previous eye injury or surgery
Family history of cataracts
Excessive alcohol use
Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications
In rare instances, infants can be born with cataracts, which may be the result with an infection, such as rubella. This infection can be contracted by the mother during pregnancy. They may also occur in combination with some other birth defect. Occasionally, infants develop cataracts shortly after birth.
Symptoms Of Cataracts
People with cataracts often do not realize they have them until their vision is affected. Symptoms of cataracts include the following:
Sensitivity to bright light
Poor night vision
Frequent changes in corrective-lens prescriptions
Blurred, hazy or double vision in one eye
Decreased color perception
Perception of halos around lights
Yellow-tinged vision is also an indicator of cataracts.
Diagnosing Cataracts
Several tests, including the following, are performed to diagnose cataracts:
Retinal examination under pupil dilation
Visual acuity test
Slit-lamp examination
Tonometry to test intraocular pressure (IOP)
In combination, such tests help determine whether a patient has cataracts, or whether her or his vision problems have some other cause. They also assist in evaluating the degree of visual impairment, and whether surgery should be performed.
What Happens If Cataracts Are Left Untreated?
A cataract can form in one or both eyes. If left untreated, cataracts worsen over time and interfere with everyday activities such as reading or driving. Night vision is usually most affected. When cataracts are in their early stages, people are helped by brighter lighting. As cataracts get worse, however, most people require surgery.
Non-Surgical Cataract Treatments
Early cataracts can sometimes be treated with nonsurgical methods, including the following:
Using magnifying lenses
The use of brighter lighting
Prescriptions to corrective-lenses
Anti-glare sunglasses
If cataracts interfere with the ability to read, work, drive at night or other daily activities, cataract surgery will be recommended.
Cataract Surgery
During cataract surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced with a clear artificial lens. The artificial lens, or intraocular lens (IOL), is positioned in the same place as your natural lens and will remain a permanent part of your eye. If cataracts are in both eyes, surgery is performed, usually 4 to 8 weeks apart, on one eye at a time. Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the United States.
Recovery From Cataract Surgery
After cataract surgery, patients usually have some discomfort for a few days. While full healing generally occurs in about eight weeks.
How To Prevent Cataracts
Although cataracts cannot be prevented, the development can sometimes be delayed by use of the following:
Wearing wide-brimmed hats to block sunlight
Wearing UV blocking sunglasses
Not smoking; not drinking excessively
Eating a diet high in antioxidants
