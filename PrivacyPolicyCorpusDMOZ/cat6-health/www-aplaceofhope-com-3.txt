Depression Help
There Is Help For Depression Near You
Depression is a very complex disease, and the true
cause of it is not yet fully known. Chemicals do play a part in depression, but
it is much more complex than a simple chemical imbalance.
Depression is personal, and each individual may present
in different ways with their depression. It is not a “one size fits all”
treatment approach that is needed, but rather one that is tailored to each
individual and where they are at.
The good news is that there is help for depression.
You are not alone and you can access help and treatment for your depression
near you.
What is depression?
If you are unsure
if what you or a loved one are feeling is depression, it would be advised to
seek help from your health professional. You may feel that even the simple
tasks of getting out of bed, making food or getting to work may seem
impossible. You may feel that getting help is too hard and it is easier to stay
as you are.

Some
of the talking therapies which work very well to help with depression are:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT)
This is a type of talking therapy that helps you to explore and change how you think about life, and it helps you to free yourself from unhelpful patterns of behavior that could be contributing to your depression or to other areas in your life.
CBT usually involves setting goals with your therapist and may involve you needing to carry out tasks each week that help you to achieve these goals.
CBT has been shown to really help with conditions such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and phobias.
Counseling
Counseling is a type of talk therapy that can be used as a therapy for depression where you talk in confidence to a counselor. They will often ask you questions and discuss finding ways to deal with the difficulties you are facing in your life.
You will be encouraged to talk about your feelings and emotions with a trained expert in counseling. They will listen to you carefully, with no judgment or criticism. They will help you to get a better understanding of your feeling and thought processes. They will help you to find your own solutions to your problems.
Counseling therapy for depression has been specially developed to help you to understand the real underlying causes of your depression.
Other
types of therapy for depression
Self-help
therapy
There
are many things that you can do to help your depression with the help and
guidance of professionals. At The
Center • A Place of HOPE there are experts who can help you and guide you on how to use simple
techniques that can help you with your depression.
Some
of these ideas someone would talk you through to use as depression therapy are:
Staying active – exercise can work as well as medication to ease depression in some people, both in the short and longer-term.Avoid alcohol – alcohol can seem to relieve your frayed nerves and calm you down, however, depression can return with vengeance later once the alcohol has worn off.Sleep is important – you may have insomnia but making sure you get enough sleep every night can help with your depression. Try to only sleep when you are tired; avoid watching TV or reading in bed; avoid using your phone or tablet in bed; avoid caffeine, larger meals, and nicotine before bed; and you can try writing down your worries in a
journal before bed. It is important to get enough sleep but not too much, and this is something a professional can help you to find the right balance that is right for you.
Medication as a therapy for depression
There are different types of medication that may help you with your depression. Doctors may start with the antidepressants first as they are often the first line of medication to treat anxiety and depression.
Your health professional at The Center • A Place of HOPE will help you
to find the right medication for you and that works well for you in your
journey to wellness.
