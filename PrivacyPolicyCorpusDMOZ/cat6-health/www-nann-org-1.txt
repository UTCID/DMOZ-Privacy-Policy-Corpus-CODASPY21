NANN Privacy Policy
Terms of Use
This policy delineates the information collected from visitors to the website as well as how we use and protect that information. Protecting your privacy and your personal data is of utmost importance to us, and guides us in creating, organizing, and implementing our activities online and offline.
Visitor Data Collected
You may browse many areas of our website, including our home page, without disclosing any personal information about yourself. Within these areas we only collect and store the information that is automatically recognized by the Web server, such as your IP address and files you request from the server. We collect, use and store the personal data that you volunteer on registration, order, survey, or other forms, or by email. Such information may be used to notify you of official NANN business, provide a product or service that you requested, secure your membership status, evaluate member and prospective member needs and interests, and alert you of NANN news, activities, services and benefits. Additionally, some areas of our website might be available only to certain persons and will require a login and password to access these areas. In order to be granted a login and password you may be asked some demographic information about yourself.
Registering on our site is optional. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use the public areas of our website. However, you will not be able to purchase items online, or be allowed access to private areas of our website. We view the customer information that we collect as a valuable and confidential asset of which we take great care to ensure its safety. Your personally identifiable information may be shared with a third party in order to complete a specific business transaction on our behalf.
We do not market our products or services to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from website users younger than 18 years of age.
Data Analysis
As described above, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we measure visitor activity on our website, but we do so in ways that maintain individual visitor anonymity. We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs periodically to measure the traffic through our servers, the number of pages visited and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.
Data Sharing
Though we make serious efforts to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
In all other cases we do not knowingly share, sell, or distribute your personal information with any third party.
Cookies and Other Technologies
We collect the anonymous information we mentioned above through the use of various technologies, one of which is called "cookies". A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Cookies may last for only a single session or may span multiple sessions. We also use cookies throughout the private sections of our website to prevent security breaches as well as to track user activity. We also use Google advertising cookies to help us understand your interests. This information will ensure you see ads for content and services that are relevant to you. Google may use this information to show you relevant ads on other sites as well. To opt out of Google tracking, see Google's ad settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Finally, cookies are employed in such applications as shopping carts, continuing education, or other applications that require the storage of user data from one screen to the next. To opt out of DoubleClick's tracking, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Individual Participation/Access
You can ask us whether we are keeping personal data about you, and you can also request to receive a copy of that personal data. Before sending you any personal data, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity. If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you the personal data.
We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to the previous questions or to correct inaccuracies in your personal information. At any time, you may request that we delete or correct your personal information in our logs. For such requests, please contact info@nann.org.

Throughout our website, you will find links to third party websites. Once you leave www.nann.org and link to another website, you are subject to the privacy policy of that website. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies or content on third-party sites and hereby disclaims any liability or responsibility in connection with such linked sites.
Security
We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personal information. We have implemented technology and security policies as reasonable precautions in the storage of the personal information you disclose to us on our website. Our employees and processors who have access to personal data are obliged to respect the privacy of our visitors and the confidentiality of their personal data. Online registration and information such as credit cared numbers will be secured using a commercially accepted method of encryption. However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information sent over our website, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety.
