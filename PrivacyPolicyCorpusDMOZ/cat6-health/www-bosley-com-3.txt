The patients featured on this website have given their permission to appear.
Testimonial statements and photographs of Bosley patients do not constitute a warranty or prediction of the outcome of your individual hair restoration. Not all patients can achieve the results depicted here. Ask your Bosley physician about your individual case.

No compensation is provided to patients for permission to use patient statements.

Stars are assigned by taking the weighted score of the patient satisfaction survey and converting to a five point scale. The rating reflects the overall experience of the patient.
Bosley has performed more than 300,000 hair transplant procedures on men and women from more than 60 different nations who suffered from hair loss. Bosley is a world leader in hair loss and medical hair restoration.
Bosley Physicians available at Regional Surgical Offices only.
