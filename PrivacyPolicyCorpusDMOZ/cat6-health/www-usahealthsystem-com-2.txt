The directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may also be released to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be given to a member of the clergy, such as priest or minister, even if they don’t ask for you by name.

In addition, in order to disclose your health information to a company for marketing purposes, we must obtain your authorization. Under the Privacy Rules, you may revoke your authorization at any time. The revocation of your authorization will be effective immediately, except to the extent that: we have relied upon it previously for the use and disclosure of your health information; the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage where other law provides the insurer with the right to contest a claim under the policy or the policy itself; or your health information was obtained as a part of a research study and is necessary to maintain the integrity of the study. Other uses and disclosures not described in this Privacy Notice will only be made with your written authorization.Your Rights Regarding Health Information About YouYou have the following rights regarding health information we maintain about you:Right to Inspect and Copy: Upon written request, you have the right to inspect and copy your own health information contained in a designated record set, maintained by or for us.

For example, this right of access does not extend to psychotherapy notes, or information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a civil, criminal or administrative proceeding.
