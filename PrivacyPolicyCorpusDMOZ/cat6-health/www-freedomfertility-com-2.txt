Version 2.0. Last Revised: 05/04/2015
These Terms of Use apply to all visitors of the Freedom Fertility pharmacy site located at http://www.FreedomFertility.com (the “Site”). These Terms of Use are between a user of any portion of the Site (“you” or “your”) and Express Scripts Holding Company (“ESHC” “we”, “us” and “our”).
ASSENT
Access to the Site is conditioned upon your assent to these Terms of Use. You are deemed to have assented to these Terms of Use when you use any publicly available page of the Site. You are deemed to have accepted these Terms of Use each time you access the Site.
UPDATES
From time to time, we may, in our sole discretion, modify these Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy, indicated by a new version number and revision date. The version number includes a major number, a decimal point, and a minor number. A change to the major number reflects a significant change to the policy, while a change to the minor number reflects a less significant change to the policy. Examples of significant changes include additional provisions that reflect new Site functionality, significant modifications to existing provisions, and more significant changes to Site functionality that cause provisions to be modified, added, or removed. Examples of less significant changes include additional provisions that clarify current Site functionality, minor modifications to existing provisions, and less significant changes to Site functionality that cause provisions to be modified, added, or removed.
We will provide you with advance notice of a major change prior to your access of any portion of the Site for which registration is required. For example, we may (i) require that you reaccept the updated version of the web policies, (ii) send you an electronic notification advising of the update to the web policies, (iii) include a notice on the Site viewable without login advising of the update to the web policies, and/or (iv) advise you of the updated web policies during a phone call. We do not ordinarily provide advance notice of a minor change.
It is important that you check these Terms of Use every time you visit the Site. Your use of the Site and/or utilization of any Site benefits after the Terms of Use have been updated (and after advance notice for a major change), indicates your agreement and acceptance of the updated version of the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy.
