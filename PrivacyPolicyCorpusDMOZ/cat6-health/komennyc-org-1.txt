Terms of Use
Terms of Use
IMPORTANT: Please review the following terms and conditions carefully. These Terms Of Use are a legally binding contract between you and Susan G. Komen (“Komen” or “our” or “we” or “us”) pertaining to the access and use of the services offered, and all products, information, content, media, content, printed materials and “online” or other electronic documentation accessible from, www.komen.org or any sub-domains thereof or other websites operated by or for Komen (collectively, the “Sites”).
The Sites are all offered by Komen to you free of charge on the express condition that you accept, without modification, and abide by these Terms Of Use. Your access and use of the Sites is conditioned upon your continued compliance with these Terms Of Use. Please read these Terms Of Use carefully, as your use of the Sites constitutes your acceptance of these Terms Of Use. Komen reserves the right to change the Terms Of Use any time by reasonable notice, including without limitation by posting revised terms on the Sites (which shall constitute reasonable notice), and such amended terms shall be binding upon you; thus, you should consult the most recent version of these Terms Of Use each time that you view the Sites.
The Promise Komen was founded on one promise made between two sisters. Komen is committed to saving lives and ending breast cancer forever by empowering people, ensuring quality care for all and energizing science to find the cures (the “Promise”). The Sites are designed, and all uses of the Sites are intended, to be in furtherance of the Promise.
Disclaimer You acknowledge that the materials on the Sites are provided “as is” for general information only and without warranties of any kind. The materials on the Sites are not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or to replace the services of a medical professional. While Komen endeavors to keep the materials on the Sites current, healthcare information changes rapidly and thus, the materials on the Sites should not be relied upon to be fully comprehensive or error free. Komen does not recommend, endorse or make any warranties or representations of any kind with regard to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, quality, efficacy or non-infringement of any of the programs, materials, products or other information provided on the Sites or by the companies or organizations linked or referred to in the Sites. The Sites do not offer medical advice or recommendations to individuals and you should not rely on the information posted on the Sites as a substitute for consultations with qualified health care professionals who are familiar with individual medical conditions and needs. Komen does not advocate that you attempt to treat yourself, your family or someone you know without proper medical supervision. Komen encourages you to seek the guidance of your healthcare provider if you feel that you, your family or someone that you know suffers from the conditions described on the Sites.
In certain instances Komen permits third parties to provide testimonials and information, and in certain situations, create personal home pages for fundraising purposes in furtherance of the Promise. Komen may from time to time post articles and other information provided by third parties that might be of interest or benefit to the public. You acknowledge that the opinions and recommendations of third parties contained on the Sites are not necessarily those of Komen or endorsed by Komen.
Restrictions on Use of Materials Unless otherwise indicated, Komen or its licensors holds the copyright to all materials on the Sites, including without limitation, research materials, photographs, text, graphics, logos, icons, images, content, sound recordings, tutorials, white papers, audio/visual clips and design. Additionally, Komen owns all of the trademarks, service marks, slogans and logos (collectively, the “Marks”) used and displayed on the Sites, unless otherwise noted. Without the explicit consent of Komen, no material from the Sites (including, without limitation, the Marks), may be copied, reproduced, displayed, republished, downloaded, posted, digitized, translated, modified, transmitted, distributed or commercially exploited in any way. Any unauthorized use of materials contained on the Sites may violate copyright, trademark and other laws. We retain all rights not expressly granted, and nothing in these Terms Of Use constitutes a waiver of any rights under copyright laws or any other federal, state or local law, regulation, ordinance or treaty. Nothing in these Terms Of Use should be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right under or to any intellectual property right, including without limitation, any patent, trademark, service mark or copyright of Komen or any third party.
Komen will allow you to view and print information, documents and web pages located on the Sites for your own personal use but not for any for-profit or commercial activities or purposes or resale; provided that (i) the copies must retain any copyright, intellectual property, proprietary or other notices or disclaimers contained in the original materials, (ii) you must give attribution to Komen and if possible provide a reference to Komen’s main site www.komen.org, (iii) the material must be printed in its entirety without modification, reformatting, adaptation or adjustment, and (iv) if you combine the materials with other hard copy materials, you must clearly designate which portion of the complete work is Komen’s material. No electronic copies are permitted. If you share the printed materials with others, you agree to advise any person to whom you share the materials as to these Terms Of Use and they must agree to abide by these Terms Of Use. Failure to abide by these conditions will immediately terminate this permission and may result in the infringement of the copyrights and/or trademarks owned by Komen or its licensors.
Sponsors Komen may choose to acknowledge certain persons and companies who have provided donations or sponsorships in furtherance of the Promise. Such acknowledgement may be in the form of recognition on the Sites by use of such persons or companies’ own names or marks and/or links to such person or companies’ own websites. However, Komen does not solicit or permit the purchase or use of advertisements or commercial endorsements on the Sites by any person or company (including, without limitation, its sponsors and donors). If you choose to click on the links to any of our sponsors’ websites or otherwise engage in any correspondence or business dealings with or other purchase of products or services from any of our sponsors, you do so on your own initiative and you agree that Komen is not responsible or liable for any loss or damages of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings or as a result of the acknowledgement of or links to such sponsors in conjunction with the Sites.
Links To Other Sites Komen may provide links to other Internet sites or resources. Komen likewise may permit others to post on certain public forums links to other Internet sites or resources. The information provided to you in such links are provided solely for your interactive enjoyment. The results are not guaranteed to be accurate and are in no way endorsed, offered or guaranteed by Komen.
General Indemnification You agree that you will hold harmless Komen, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, licensors and suppliers from all claims arising out of or related to your access or use of, or your inability to access or use, the Sites or other sites to which they are linked. If your use of materials from the Sites results in the need for servicing, repair of equipment or data, you will assume any costs thereof.
Limitation of Liability In no event and under no circumstances shall Komen or the contributors of information to the Sites or our sponsors, licensors or authorized representatives be liable to you or any third party for special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages (including without limitation any loss of profits, lost savings, or loss of data) arising out of your (or any authorized user’s) or any unrelated party’s use or inability to use the Sites, or your (or any authorized user’s) or any unrelated party’s reliance or use of information, products or services provided on or through the Internet, or that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletions of files or other data loss, errors, defects, delays in operation, service or transmission or any failure of performance of the Sites, even if we, or any of our authorized representatives, have been advised of the possibility of such damage and even if the remedies stated in these Terms Of Use fail of their essential purpose.

Disclaimer Regarding Translated Content
In addition to the general disclaimer of warranties provided under these Terms Of Use, Komen does not warrant the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information provided on its Sites in languages other than English (“Translated Content”).  Any person or entity that relies on information obtained from the Translated Content does so at his or her own risk.  Komen is not responsible for any damage or issues that may possibly result from using the Translated Content.  If any questions arise concerning the accuracy of the information presented in the Translated Content, please refer to the official English version of the website.
Website Services Services. In furtherance of the Promise, Komen may offer from time to time certain services or features on the Sites (including without limitation, message boards, blogs, chatrooms, public forums, personal home pages, on-line donations, shopping carts and tutorials) (collectively, the “Services”). The following terms under these Terms Of Use pertain to your ability to use the Services made available by Komen on the Sites. Komen will permit your use of the Services free of charge on the express condition that you accept, without modification, and abide by these Terms Of Use, only for as long as your use of the Services are helping Komen to fulfill the Promise.
Account Set Up. Browsing of the Sites public pages is currently provided free of charge to any person. However, access to the Services and certain features of the Sites will require an account to be first established and activated for you. You may sign up for an account by accessing the Sites and following the direction for setting up an account. When you register for an account, you will be asked to create a unique user name (and/or a forum name), a password and a valid email address for your account. You will be asked whether you have read these Terms Of Use and agree to abide by its terms. You may be asked specific questions if you are seeking to use certain features of the Sites (such as a Personal Home Page), and your answers to those questions will determine whether or not you are eligible to register for those features. If you answer “I agree” and you answer all of the questions posed for each feature and otherwise are eligible, your account may be activated. If you answer “I Do Not Agree” or otherwise do not answer all of the questions or otherwise are not eligible, your account will not be activated and you will not be permitted to access the Services online. Komen reserves the right to decline to activate an account for any person for any reason. If your account is activated, you will receive a notification email immediate after you register and you must confirm your email address and acceptance of these Terms Of Use by clicking on the confirmation link in the notification email.  Once your account is activated and you have confirmed, you will be permitted to log in, view, load, post and use the Services and the specific features of each Komen public forum or service for which you have been registered. By making such confirmation, you acknowledge that you have read these Terms Of Use, understand your rights and obligations, and agree to be bound by these Terms Of Use. You acknowledge that certain Services will be provided subject to additional terms and conditions (or a separate written agreement only) and you agree that you will abide by such additional terms and conditions applicable to those Services.
Password Protection. You must have a password to access the Services online via your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and protecting against unauthorized use of your password. You also are responsible for all activities that occur under your password and user name or your account made by you or others. You will immediately notify Komen if your password is lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized third party or otherwise has been compromised or if there is any other breach of security. You must ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You will be permitted to access only those portions of the Sites for which you have been granted permission to use by Komen.

In consideration of your use of the Sites and the Services, you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our account activation form; and (ii) maintain and promptly update such account information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such account information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites or the Services or any portion thereof.
Parental Consent. As part of the account activation process, you must certify that you are 18 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 18, then your parent or legal guardian may establish an account for each minor child who may use the Services. In such event, the parent or legal guardian must certify that he or she is at least 18 years old and that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the child/children listed on the account. The parent or legal guardian also must provide his or her contact information. By creating an account for a minor, the parent or legal guardian gives your minor child permission to access all of the Sites and the Services. As the legal guardian or parent, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Sites and the Services and/or information contained on the Sites is appropriate for the minor child and whether the minor child should participate in any feature of the Sites or Services, including without limitation the message boards, blogs or chatrooms. You should understand that we may disclose any activity under the minor child’s account to the parent or legal guardian.
Message Boards & Other Public Forums. As part of your account, you may participate in certain message boards, blogs, chatrooms, instant messaging and other public forums. Your participation is voluntary; however by choosing to post or send a message or blog or otherwise participate in any public forum, you acknowledge and agree that any information or content provided by you may be viewed by the general public and will not be treated as private or confidential. You further agree that Komen may use the posted content in any manner that it deems necessary or appropriate. Komen reserves the right to edit or abridge content for any reason and to edit, refuse to post or remove any content submitted by you or others. Komen cannot and does not guarantee that it will post every content submitted or that such content will not be offensive, defamatory, or objectionable. Although Komen reserves the right to remove without notice any posting for any reason, Komen has no obligation to delete content that you personally may find objectionable or offensive. Komen does not control in real time the information posted via the Services and as such does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such information. In addition to other disclaimers found in these Terms Of Use, Komen does not endorse or make any warranties or representations with regard to the accuracy, completeness or timeliness or any content posted on any Komen public forum.
Personal Home Page. While accessing or using the Sites, you may be provided access to website development tools and/or  the use of a fundraising web space that can be personalized with your own content or otherwise to create a personal webpage (each such page being a “Personal Home Page”). Your Personal Home Page may have several features such as my story page, a slide show (up to 10 photos with captions), a link to donate to “my Komen event”, a link to testimonials or comments that can be edited only by you), donation goal (optional), personal URL at komen.org (or such other sub-domain or URL as may be designated by Komen), guest book and email address book. In addition to these Terms Of Use, your use of the Personal Home Page and related Services may require your agreement and compliance with supplemental terms at the time that you register for a Personal Home Page.  Prior to registering for a Personal Home Page, you will be required to agree to these Terms Of Use.
Posted or Shared Content.
You may post or share messages, text, photos, testimonials or other content (including, without limitation, information that you provide about survivorship status) on the Sites via the public forums, your Personal Home Page or any page on the Sites that specifically provides that the content may be used in a public manner.
Any such content submitted to Komen will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary, and you authorize Komen and its affiliates and licensees, without compensation to you or others, to copy, reproduce, incorporate, distribute, publicly display, publish or otherwise use all or any part of such information in furtherance of its operations and the Promise throughout the world in any format or media (whether now know or hereafter created) for the duration of any copyright or other rights in such content, and such permission may not be revoked for any reason. To the extent permitted under applicable law, you waive and release and covenant not to assert any moral or privacy rights that you may have in any such content posted or shared by you. By posting or sharing such content, you represent to Komen that you own or have the right to use and permit Komen to use such content in the manner stated above. By way of example and not limitation, if you post a photograph of yourself with others, you need to first obtain permission or a release from the other people appearing in the photograph to use their image on your Personal Home Page, and you need to be the owner or licensee of the copyright in the photograph. You agree not to post or share any information relating to or photographs or text that belongs to any person other than yourself or that contains the name, voice or likeness of any person other than yourself unless you first obtain permission to do so from that person. If you identify yourself by name or provide a picture or audio or video recording of yourself, you further authorize Komen and its affiliates and licensees (without compensation to you or others) to reproduce, print, publish and disseminate in any format or media (whether now known or hereafter created) your name, voice and likenesses in furtherance of Komen’s operations and the Promise throughout the world, and any such permission cannot be revoked for any reason.
Komen reserves the right to refuse to post or share content, remove content, or disable your account due to:
(i) the high-risk nature of a proposed fundraising activity (e.g. bungee jumping, parachuting, hand gliding, cliff diving); (ii) the potentially negative impact on Komen’s outstanding public image due to a proposed fundraising activity or posted or shared content; or (iii) any other reasonable factor as determined by Komen in its sole discretion.
If Komen elects to disable your account is, Komen will notify you of its disapproval via email at the address provided with your registration.
Availability of Service. Komen reserves the right to establish general practices and limits concerning the Services and user accounts at any time (and may modify such practices and limits at its sole discretion), including without limitation the maximum number of days that your or any third-party’s information, pictures, content or email will be retained and the maximum amount of disk space that will be allotted on Komen’s servers on your behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that Komen shall have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to deliver or store your Personal Home Page or any other public forum, or any information, pictures, content or email provided by or stored by you on your Personal Homepage or any other public forum, regardless of whether such deletion or failure was due to the established practices or limits of the Services or as a result of error, intentional misconduct, or negligence of Komen. You acknowledge that Komen reserves the right to log off accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time and reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to modify or discontinue, either temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Komen shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services.
Privacy of Patient Information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) may regulate and limit the use and disclosure of your private health information by certain healthcare institutions. However, you should know that the HIPAA regulations apply to information gathered in the treatment of patients and not to information gathered by or through the Sites. For details on how Komen protects the privacy of personally identifiable information gathered by or through the Sites, please see our Privacy Policy.

In order to purchase products from the Sites’ store or make donations online, you must submit the necessary contact and payment information, including, without limitation, your name, address, credit card and email. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information in your account(s) supplied by you to Komen. By providing such information to Komen by any means (e.g.: email, fax, telephone, mail, etc.), you represent that any information or materials provided by you shall be accurate, complete and correct and that you shall have lawful right to provide such information to Komen for use in processing your orders or receiving your donations from the Sites.

By using the Sites’ payment method, you confirm that you possess the legal authority to enter into the conditions of use for the Sites, including, without limitation, instructing Komen or its authorized vendors to collect any payments from a credit or debit card, and to use the Sites in accordance with all terms and conditions of these Terms Of Use.

Please provide all of the information requested above. No specific form is required to provide Komen with notifications of possible infringement. However, it will take Komen longer to process your notice if any of this information is not provided, and in some cases, we may not be able to process your notice.
COPPA Komen does not knowingly solicit data from children or knowingly market to children. Komen is concerned about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Childrens’ Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, it does not knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. In the event that Komen receives actual knowledge that it has collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, Komen will delete that information from the Sites as quickly as is reasonably practical.
Privacy Komen understands that many visitors to the Sites may be concerned about the information that they may provide or that may be generated from their use of the Sites and how Komen may use such information. Protecting privacy is an important priority to Komen. Our Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information gathered from the Sites and you can view our Privacy Policy.
Equitable Remedies You agree that, if the terms of these Terms Of Use are not specifically enforced, we will be irreparably damaged, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect any breach(es), in addition to any other available remedies.
Governing Law; Venue; Statute of Limitations These Terms Of Use are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., excluding any conflict of laws, rules or similar principals, and the applicable laws, regulations and treaties of the United States of America. Any action arising out of any dispute with respect to this Agreement shall only be brought in the state or federal courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You agree that the statute of limitations for any claim against Komen shall be brought within one year from when the claim arose, and any claims not brought within such period of time shall be deemed waived.
Dispute Resolution In the event of any dispute arising out of these Terms Of Use, you and Komen each agree to use good faith efforts to resolve our differences amicably. In the event those efforts are unsuccessful, you and Komen agree not to commence litigation until attempting to resolve our dispute through mediation. Either you or Komen may initiate the mediation process with thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other. The dispute shall be submitted to mediation in Dallas, Texas, U.S.A. Costs of mediation shall be borne equally by both you and Komen. Mediation of the dispute shall be completed within fifteen (15) days of commencement, unless you and Komen agree to extend the time by mutual agreement or unless the mediator declares you and Komen to be at an impasse. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that Komen believes that immediate injunctive relief is required to protect its rights, Komen may invoke the immediate powers of the appropriate court of law without the requirement to first mediate the dispute.
Miscellaneous If any provision of these Terms Of Use is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then that provision shall be fully severable from these Terms Of Use and shall not effect the legality, validity, or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms Of Use.
Failure by us to enforce any particular term of these Terms Of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any of our rights hereunder.
These Terms Of Use have been written in the English language and the English language shall control. These Terms Of Use, which are in English, shall be interpreted in accordance with the commonly understood meaning of the words and phrases in the United States of America. You waive any right that you may have under local law to receive these Terms Of Use in any language other than English.
These Terms Of Use (and each supplemental agreement referenced in or referencing these Terms Of Use found on the Sites) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Komen with respect to the Sites and the Services.
