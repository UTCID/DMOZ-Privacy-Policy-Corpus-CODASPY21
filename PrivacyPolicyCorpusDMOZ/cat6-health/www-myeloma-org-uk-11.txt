Currently, there are 107 support groups in the UK and Ireland that are listed on our website. Most of these are myeloma-specific, but there are also several general haematology groups that welcome those affected by myeloma. Some groups are run by patients, carers or family members, others by healthcare professionals (i.e. nurses), and each group varies in their size, the frequency they meet and format. We provide support, information and resources to the group leaders, to make sure everyone who attends gets the best level of support.

Support Groups can benefit patients, families and carers by providing emotional support, friendship and relief from isolation. They also offer the chance to share information and experiences with those in a similar situation.
If you’d like to set up a Support Group in your area, you can download our Infosheet or contact us directly on 0131 557 3332, or email support@myeloma.org.uk.
