ADAA also understands that one's experience with mental illness is greatly affected by one’s unique values, beliefs, and sexual orientations, in addition to backgrounds that vary by race, ethnicity, religion, and language.Cultural differences can influence whether or not mental illness is properly diagnosed and/or treated. There are many barriers that diverse communities face when seeking healthcare in general. Some of these barriers include: higher levels of stigma, misinformation about mental health and language that may discourage people from seeking help. A person’s beliefs, norms, values and language affect how the perceive and experience mental health conditions. The experiences with mental illness are greatly affected by different cultural views.
To effectively serve diverse populations, the community and mental health professionals need to understand, respect and value all of the different cultural differences and perspectives towards mental health. Increasing and applying cultural competence is important when serving diverse communities.
ADAA is committed to providing anxiety, depression and related disorder resources and current research for the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), Latinx/Hispanic, Asian-American/Pacific Islander, LGBTQ+, and low income communities.
