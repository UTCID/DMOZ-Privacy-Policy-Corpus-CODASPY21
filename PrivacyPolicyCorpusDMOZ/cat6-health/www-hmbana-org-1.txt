Thank you for helping premature and fragile infants access donor human milk. Donating your milk, money, or time helps save lives.
Exclusive human milk feeding significantly reduces the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a leading cause for prematurity-related death. A premature baby in the NICU may eat as little as one ounce or less in a single feeding.
