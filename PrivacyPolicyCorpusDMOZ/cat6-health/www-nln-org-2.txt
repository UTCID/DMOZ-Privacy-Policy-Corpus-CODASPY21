Third Party Links
NLN partners with, or holds licenses from, other companies to develop and deliver its products and services to you. The NLN website contains links to these external third party websites which have separate and independent privacy policies. Please be sure to read that company's privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your information on their site. The same applies to any third party websites or content you connect to using our products and services. NLN is not responsible for the data managed and contained on third party servers.
You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including, but not limited to, those offered by Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) or using third party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information. Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies.
Cookies
NLN uses cookies and related technology to analyze website traffic. Cookies assist in personalizing your online experience, simplifying subsequent website visits, and helping to remember certain information about your browser and your information. This allows NLN to better facilitate our electronic communications with you. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a web page. Cookies are unique and can only be read by the issuing domain's web server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but you can modify your browser to decline using cookies. This, however, may limit your experience of any interactive features of the website you visit.
Website Security
No electronic storage or data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we implement physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your information, regardless of our efforts, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions, information or private communications. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information collected in connection with the Services.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your device by, among other things, choosing a robust password that others do not know and cannot easily guess, and keeping your password private. We are not responsible for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity or unauthorized access to your device.
Age
We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 13 years of age. No information should be submitted to or otherwise made available on or through the Services by individuals under 13 years of age.
UK and EU Rights
General
Under UK and EU law, UK and EU users may have certain additional privacy rights, such as the right to lodge a complaint with data protection regulators. The Information Commissioners' Office ("ICO") is the UK's lead regulator. You can find out how to raise a concern with the ICO by visiting their website at www.ico.org.uk. If you're within the EU, you may also get in touch with your local Data Protection Regulator who may liaise with the ICO on your behalf.
Advertising; Other Uses of Personal Data
We may use material that you post on the open access areas of the Services in advertising and promotional materials on our partner sites and partner products. We believe these uses are in line with our legitimate interests in enabling us to improve our Services and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs. If we intend to do this, we will contact you for your prior approval. We use your personal data to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") with respect to use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to unsubscribe@nln.org detailing your privacy request.

For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to "Your California Privacy Rights" and include your name, street address, city, state, ZIP code and email address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via phone, postal mail, or by fax. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete or legible information.
Changes to this Privacy
From time to time, we may amend this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion. In addition to posting any amended Privacy Policy publicly on the NLN website, we may also, to the extent required by applicable law, distribute amended terms directly to users of the Services. Your failure to terminate your user account following any such amendment shall constitute your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as amended. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are aware of any changes.

It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful, and accurate information, including with respect to personal information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us complete, truthful, or accurate information or you fail to update such information. We may reject and delete any information that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

By using the Services, you affirmatively consent to the transfer, use, storage, processing, disclosure, provision, and other administration of your information in the United States and as described herein.
