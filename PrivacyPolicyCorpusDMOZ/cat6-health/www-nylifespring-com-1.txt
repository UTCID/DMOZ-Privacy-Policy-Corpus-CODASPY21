Donor Privacy
Privacy: Recipient Privacy
desire to maintain confidentiality is one of the main reasons that recipients decide to select an egg donor through NY LifeSpring LLC. Donor compensation is passed from the recipients to the donors through a NY LifeSpring LLC trust account, and no contact information about the recipients passes to the donor. Donors will only find out how many oocytes (eggs) were retrieved. They will not know whether the cycle resulted in pregnancy, nor even how many embryos resulted from fertilization.
In fact, donors generally express as much concern about the issue of privacy as recipients do. While recipients want to be certain that their identities are not revealed to the donor and that she cannot claim to have any parental rights, donors want to be certain that their own identities are withheld and that the donation does not make them responsible for any resulting children.
