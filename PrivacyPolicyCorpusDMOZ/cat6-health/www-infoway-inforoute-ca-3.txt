Privacy Impact Assessments
A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) helps projects consider the actual or potential effects that a proposed technology, information system or program may have on an individual’s privacy. It also helps the project in assessing its compliance with applicable privacy requirements and in identifying mitigation strategies for addressing privacy risks that may be identified.
Where applicable, sponsors of Infoway-funded projects are responsible for completing and submitting a PIA to Infoway. Download A "Conceptual" Privacy Impact Assessment of the EHRS Blueprint Version 2 to learn more.
