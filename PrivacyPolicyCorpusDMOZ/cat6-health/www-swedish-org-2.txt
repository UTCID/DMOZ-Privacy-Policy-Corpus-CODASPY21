Disclaimer Terms Of Use
Disclaimer / Terms Of Use
1. Definitions.
"Swedish.org" is the interactive on-line service operated by Swedish Medical Center ("SMC") on the World Wide Web of the Internet, consisting of information services and content provided by SMC and other third parties. "Subscriber" means each person who establishes or accesses a connection ("Account") for access to and use of Swedish.org.
2. General.
(A) This Agreement, which incorporates by reference other provisions applicable to use of Swedish.org governing the use of certain specific material contained in Swedish.org, sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to use of Swedish.org by Subscriber. By using Swedish.org (other than to read this Agreement for the first time), Subscriber agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to use Swedish.org is personal to Subscriber and is not transferable to any other person or entity. Subscriber is responsible for all use of Subscriber's Account (under any screen name or password) and for ensuring that all use of Subscriber's Account complies fully with the provisions of this Agreement. Subscriber shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of Subscriber's password(s), if any.
(B) SMC shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of Swedish.org, including, but not limited to, content, hours of availability, and equipment needed for access or use.
3. Changed Terms.
SMC shall have the right at any time to change or modify the terms and conditions applicable to Subscriber's use of Swedish.org, or any part thereof, or to impose new conditions, including, but not limited to, adding fees and charges for use. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, posting on Swedish.org, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means by which Subscriber obtains notice thereof. Any use of Swedish.org by Subscriber after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by Subscriber of such changes, modifications or additions.
4. Equipment.
Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of Swedish.org and all charges related thereto.
5. Subscriber Conduct.
(A) Subscriber shall use Swedish.org for lawful purposes only. Subscriber shall not post or transmit through Swedish.org any material which violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, which is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any law, or which, without SMC's express prior approval, contains advertising or any solicitation with respect to products or services. Any conduct by a Subscriber that in SMC's discretion restricts or inhibits any other Subscriber from using or enjoying Swedish.org will not be permitted. Subscriber shall not use Swedish.org to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation, including, but not limited to, the solicitation of users to become subscribers of other on-line information services competitive with Swedish.org.
(B) Swedish.org contains copyrighted material, trademarks and other proprietary information, including, but not limited to, text, software, photos, video, graphics, music and sound, and the entire contents of Swedish.org are copyrighted as a collective work under the United States copyright laws. SMC owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement of such content, as well as in the content original to it. Subscriber may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit, any of the content, in whole or in part. Except as otherwise expressly permitted under copyright law, no copying, redistribution, retransmission, publication or commercial exploitation of downloaded material will be permitted without the express permission of SMC and the copyright owner. In the event of any permitted copying, redistribution or publication of copyrighted material, no changes in or deletion of author attribution, trademark legend or copyright notice shall be made.
(C) Subscriber shall not upload, post or otherwise make available on Swedish.org any material protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right and the burden of determining that any material is not protected by copyright rests with Subscriber. Subscriber shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm resulting from such a submission. By submitting material to any public area of Swedish.org, Subscriber automatically grants, or warrants that the owner of such material has expressly granted SMC the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material. Subscriber also permits any other Subscriber to access, view, store or reproduce the material for that Subscriber's personal use. Subscriber hereby grants SMC the right to edit, copy, publish and distribute any material made available on Swedish.org by Subscriber.
(D) The foregoing provisions of Section 5 are for the benefit of SMC, its subsidiaries, affiliates and its third party content providers and licensors and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty; Limitation of Liability.
(A) SUBSCRIBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF SWEDISH.ORG IS AT SUBSCRIBER'S SOLE RISK. NEITHER SMC, ITS AFFILIATES NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT SWEDISH.ORG WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF SWEDISH.ORG, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED THROUGH SWEDISH.ORG.
(B) SWEDISH.ORG IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OTHER THAN THOSE WARRANTIES WHICH ARE IMPLIED BY AND INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR MODIFICATION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT.
(C) THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, COMMUNICATION LINE FAILURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR USE OF RECORD, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS BEHAVIOR, NEGLIGENCE, OR UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION. SUBSCRIBER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SMC IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER SUBSCRIBERS OR THIRD-PARTIES AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH SUBSCRIBER.
(D) IN NO EVENT WILL SMC, OR ANY PERSON OR ENTITY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING SWEDISH.ORG OR THE SMC INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SWEDISH.ORG. SUBSCRIBER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO ALL CONTENT ON SWEDISH.ORG.
7. Monitoring.
SMC shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of Swedish.org, including chat rooms and forums, to determine compliance with this Agreement and any operating rules established by SMC and to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized government request. SMC shall have the right in its sole discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on Swedish.org. Without limiting the foregoing, SMC shall have the right to remove any material that SMC, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable.
8. Indemnification.

Either SMC or Subscriber may terminate this Agreement at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, SMC shall have the right to immediately terminate Subscriber's Account in the event of any conduct by Subscriber which SMC, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by Subscriber of this Agreement. The provisions of Sections 5(B), 5(C), 5(D), 6, 8, 10 and this Section 9 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
10. Trademarks.
Swedish Medical Center, Swedish.org , SMC and each of their logos are trademarks of Swedish Medical Center. All rights reserved. All other trademarks appearing on Swedish.org are the property of their respective owners.
11. Third Party Content.
SMC is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and Subscribers. Accordingly, SMC has no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers, Subscribers or any other user of Swedish.org, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of SMC. Neither SMC nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to Section 6 above for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.)
In many instances, the content available through Swedish.org represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, Subscriber, or other user not under contract with SMC. SMC neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on Swedish.org by anyone other than authorized SMC employee spokespersons while acting in their official capacities. Under no circumstances will SMC be liable for any loss or damage caused by a Subscriber's reliance on information obtained through Swedish.org. It is the responsibility of Subscriber to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other content available through Swedish.org. PLEASE SEEK THE ADVICE OF PROFESSIONALS, AS APPROPRIATE, REGARDING THE EVALUATION OF ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION, OPINION, ADVICE OR OTHER CONTENT. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE OBTAINING MEDICAL EVALUATIONS AND HEALTH-CARE ADVICE FROM QUALIFIED HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS. REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR SERVICES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE OR IMPLY RECOMMENDATION OR ENDORSEMENT BY SMC.
12. Miscellaneous.
This Agreement and any operating rules for Swedish.org established by SMC constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.
