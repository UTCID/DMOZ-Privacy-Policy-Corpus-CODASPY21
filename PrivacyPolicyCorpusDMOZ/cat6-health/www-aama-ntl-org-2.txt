Site Rules and Privacy Policies
Copyright Copyright 1996-2013 American Association of Medical Assistants All materials posted on this site are subject to copyrights owned by the American Association of Medical Assistants (AAMA). AAMA hereby provides limited permission for the user of this site to reproduce, retransmit, or reprint for such user’s own personal use (and for such personal use only) part or all of any document on this site as long as the copyright notice and permission notice contained in such document or portion thereof is included in such reproduction, retransmission, or reprinting. All other reproduction, retransmission, or reprinting of all or part of any document found on this site is expressly prohibited, unless AAMA has expressly granted its prior written consent to so reproduce, retransmit, or reprint the material. All other rights reserved. Trademark The names, trademarks, service marks, and logos of AAMA appearing on this site may not be used in any advertising or publicity, or otherwise to indicate AAMA’s sponsorship of or affiliation with any product or service, without AAMA’s written permission. Disclaimers AAMA is providing information and services on this site as a benefit and service in furtherance of AAMA’s non-profit and tax-exempt status. AAMA makes no representations about the suitability of this information and these services for any purpose.
AAMA does not exert editorial control over the materials that are posted by third parties onto the site or materials that are e-mailed by third parties to any other persons. AAMA is not responsible for any material posted by any third party. AAMA specifically disclaims any and all liability for any claims or damages which may result from any postings by third parties. Privacy We will endeavor to keep all e-mail private, viewable only by you and the person to whom you address it, except:
We, as site operators, may need to look at your e-mail if we believe it is necessary to protect ourselves or other visitors from injury or damage. For example, if we have reason to believe a visitor is involved in activities that violate our rules or applicable law, which could lead the authorities to seize or search this site’s server, we may review his or her e-mail for our own protection. We will not, however, monitor electronic mail unless we obtain reason to believe it is being misused.
We will not deliberately disclose electronic mail to other visitors. If we believe certain electronic mail is connected with activities that violate our rules or applicable law, we may disclose it to the authorities to protect ourselves and other callers.
Remember that the person to whom you send electronic mail is not legally required to keep it secret. The sender or receiver of electronic mail has the right to make it public.
If a governmental authority ever searches or seizes this site’s server, it may gain access to your private e-mail. In that case, we cannot assure they will not review it. Remember that you have personal rights of privacy that even the government cannot legally violate, though you may have to go to court to enforce those rights.
All electronic messages may be copied as a routine matter and may be destroyed on a regular basis. AAMA disclaims any responsibility to maintain copies of any such communication or to assure that such information is deleted. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity The great danger for us, and for all operators of websites, is that we might be held accountable for the wrongful actions of our visitors. If one visitor libels another visitor, the injured visitor might blame us, even though the first visitor was really at fault. If a visitor uploads a program with a computer virus, and other visitors' computers are damaged, we might be blamed even though the virus was left on our board by a visitor. If a visitor transfers illegal credit card information to another visitor through private electronic mail, we might be blamed even though we did nothing more than unknowingly carry the message from one visitor to another.
We did not start this site to take the blame for others' actions, and we cannot afford to operate it if we must take that blame. Accordingly, all visitors must accept responsibility for their own acts, and to accept that an act by another visitor that damages them must not be blamed on us, but on the other visitor. Therefore, as a condition of participation in this site, participants must agree as follows:
You agree that AAMA will not be responsible to you for any indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages or losses you may incur in connection with visiting this site or any of the data or other materials transmitted through or residing on this site, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage or loss. In addition, you agree to defend and indemnify AAMA and hold AAMA harmless from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to any acts or omissions by you or materials or information transmitted by you in connection with our forum leading wholly or partially to claims against AAMA or this site by other callers or third parties.
The mission of the American Association of Medical Assistants is to provide the medical assistant professional with education, certification, credential acknowledgment, networking opportunities, scope-of-practice protection, and advocacy for quality patient-centered health care.
