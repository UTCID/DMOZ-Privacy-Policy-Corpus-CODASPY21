Stroke changes lives, and not for the better.
"The majority of stroke patients will never recover fully, or go back to their pre-stroke condition," says Dr. Gerard Francisco, one the nation's leading physicians in the field of brain injury and stroke rehabilitation. Francisco serves as Chief Medical Officer and Director of the NeuroRecovery Research Center at TIRR Memorial Hermann. He has overseen the treatment of enough stroke patients to recognize the advantages of today's rehab techniques over those used just a few years ago.
"Now is a most exciting time to be in stroke rehab, because we have so many new opportunities to help our patients."
On average, every 40 seconds in America someone suffers a stroke. Whether it's a new or recurrent condition, that adds up to 800,000 strokes per year, according to the National Stroke Association. Stroke is so common that even though survival rates are high, it's the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S.
Stroke occurs when a blood vessel within the brain ruptures, or a vessel carrying blood to the brain is blocked. With blood flow cut off, cells in the affected area of the brain begin to die. The severity of each stroke depends on where in the brain the stroke occurs, and how much of the brain is damaged.
Stroke is still the leading cause of adult disability in the U.S., and about two-thirds of survivors will experience some loss of physical ability. Loss of motor functions on one side of the body, muscle weakness, foot drop (inability to lift up the front part of a foot when walking), loss of speech, difficulty swallowing and incontinence are common disabilities. These symptoms are typically accompanied by varying degrees of pain, numbness and fatigue.
Disturbances in gait (a person's manner of walking) and loss of mobility of the limbs can result from these disabilities. While physical and occupational therapies have been prescribed for decades, new approaches that automate many aspects of rehabilitation are enabling patients to perform therapies on their own, in their homes.
At TIRR the use of lower-limb robotic devices is being studied under the leadership of Dr. Francisco. He says that after acute hospitalization, stroke patients used to be given a formulaic approach to physical, occupational and speech therapies. "These therapies were lengthy and intense," says Francisco. "And they require immense physical stamina on the part of the therapist."

But the last five years has seen the growing use of robotics and other devices to aid and sustain the repetitive muscle movement that's required for stroke patients to regain some of their lost balance, gait and mobility. The key, says Dr. Francisco, is to get the patient moving.
"[Therapy] could start with encouraging a patient to move using something as rudimentary as a Nintendo Wii," he says. "There are now more sophisticated robotics being used in rehab clinics, and we're hoping that in the future we'll be able to deploy them in the home."
Commercially available devices made by innovators such as Ekso Bionics, ReWalk and Indego work by applying robotically powered motion assistance to a patient's lower limbs. Through intensive repetition, they can help patients relearn the muscle memory required for walking. TIRR is one of the few rehabilitation hospitals where many different types of lower-limb robotic devices are being tested, and much of Francisco's research seeks to understand the features and advantages of each. One common advantage of all, says Francisco: "Robots don't get tired."
Loss of motor function in the wrist and hands is also a common post-stroke disability. Unable to perform simple tasks such as grasping and releasing objects, many patients are left with a loss of independence. A line of therapy equipment manufactured by Saebo is designed to help them regain that independence. Saebo's lightweight, low-profile glove devices use tension bands, and sensory electrical stimulation in some models, to rehabilitate wrist, hand and finger muscles affected by stroke. Used in-home for performing a series of grasp-and-release tasks, which are essential for neuroplasticity and motor learning, these exercises can help improve motor function of the hands and fingers, and help patients regain their independence.
Francisco says that while today's robotics show tremendous promise, each patient responds differently to them. And, he adds, robotics aren't used alone in his team's research. Recently, he and his team at TIRR completed a study combining amphetamines, non-surgical brain stimulation and neurologic therapy with robotic therapy to aid patients' speech recovery. "We're still trying to understand the best ways to use these robots in combinations with other therapies," Francisco says.
There's still much research to be done, according to Francisco. "Our goal is to devise an individualized long-term treatment program for each patient, and that's where in-home robotics become so useful. These technologies can continue boosting recovery years after the stroke, and we're trying to figure out how to supervise that therapy remotely through telemedicine. We want to train people to use them in the real world and at home and in their communities, versus in a lab setting, so that we can add quality to their lives."
