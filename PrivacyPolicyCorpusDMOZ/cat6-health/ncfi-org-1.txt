Privacy Policy
This policy adopted in 2018, covers all aspects of our collection, use and protection of information.
Nurses Christian Fellowship International (NCFI) is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization. Maintenance of its tax-exempt status is important for its continued financial stability and for public support. Therefore, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as well as state regulatory and tax officials view the operations of NCFI as a public trust, which is subject to scrutiny by and accountable to such governmental authorities as well as to members of the public. Consequently, there exists between NCFI and its board, officers, employees, volunteers, and the public, a fiduciary duty, which carries with it a broad and unbending duty of loyalty and fidelity. The board, officers, employees and volunteers have the responsibility of administering the affairs of NCFI honestly and prudently, and of exercising their best care, skill and judgment for the sole benefit of NCFI. Those persons shall exercise the utmost good faith in all transactions involved in their duties, and they shall not use their positions with NCFI or knowledge gained therefrom for their personal benefit. The interests of the organization must be the first priority in all decisions and actions. NCFI standard of privacy All staff, members and others acting as volunteers, contractors and suppliers working for or on behalf of NCFI must comply with the NCFI Policy of Privacy when handling personal information of members, donors, staff or volunteers. All those working with personal information in NCFI are required to read this document and by signing it, they confirm that they will keep these practices. Personal information is defined as “data that identifies an individual or enables an individual to be identified”.

Such information can be gathered in relation to NCFI conferences and congresses, courses run by or in collaboration with NCFI, subscriptions for NCFI services, and contacts through NCFI website. NCFI will only use such information to plan our activities, to process requests, and to send information that we see as beneficial in serving nurses around the world. Data generated before, during, and after NCFI congresses shall be used solely for the work of NCFI. NCFI will not send unsolicited emails on behalf of a third party to our members. Some or all of the following types of data, where necessary for the work of NCFI, may be collected and processed:

Where you provide the information, we may collect sensitive personal data, including, your religious beliefs or your physical or mental health.
All NCFI information and NCFI subscriptions sent out to groups by email shall be sent with email addresses as Bcc so all identities are hidden. NCFI will consider these questions to help judge which information should be processed or kept.
Do we really need this information about an individual? Do we know what we are going to use it for? Do the people whose information we hold know that we have got it, and are they likely to understand what it will be used for? If we are asked to pass on personal information, would the people about whom we hold information expect me to do this? Are we satisfied that the information is being held securely, whether it is on paper or on computer? Is the NCFI website secure? Is access to personal information limited to those with a strict need to know? Are we sure that personal information is accurate and up to date? Do we delete or destroy personal information as soon as we have no more need for it?
