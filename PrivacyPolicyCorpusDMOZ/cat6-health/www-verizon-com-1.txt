Verizon Accessibility Statement
We are committed to making our digital space accessible to all, regardless of ability.
We want to make sure that every customer has the chance to get the very most from their Verizon digital experience.  Accessing the products and services we offer online should be an easy, rewarding, and satisfying experience. That is why we are committed to making our digital space accessible for customers of all abilities.
We strive to optimize each customers digital experience.
To optimize the digital experience for all of our customers, we strive to meet the online accessibility standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA. We take a number of steps to attempt to meet or exceed those standards:
We utilize various assistive technology across desktop, tablets, mobile devices, and in-store to test against the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
We work with our Disabilities Issues Awareness Leaders (DIAL) and Neurodiversity resource groups, as well as industry partners, to remain informed about accessibility issues and to improve user experiences.
We have a diverse and inclusive team of accessibility professionals who are continuously working to make each customers digital experience the best it can be.
We will continue our efforts to make our digital space accessible to all.
Our commitment to accessibility doesnt stop. We continue to assess and reassess our content to create a more accessible user experience across our digital space.
