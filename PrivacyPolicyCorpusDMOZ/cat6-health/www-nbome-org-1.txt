In this notice, the term “website” includes all NBOME websites, platforms and applications that collect personal information.
Whenever we change our policy, we will provide notification on our home page. You can contact us anytime with questions or concerns about privacy by sending an email to privacy@nbome.org.

The provision of information is sometimes required by law and at other times is a result of a contractual requirement. For example, in order to register and provide testing services, the failure to provide necessary information could, in certain circumstances, preclude you from registering for or receiving the testing services. In general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on the application forms. However, you are not required to provide information regarding your race. Providing this information is optional and does not affect the outcome of your application. The NBOME uses information about the race of its applicants for research purposes and to ensure the fairness of our exams.
By providing your personal information, you acknowledge that NBOME will use that information in accordance with this Notice.
