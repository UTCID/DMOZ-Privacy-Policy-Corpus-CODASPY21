Sometimes people in recovery have direct needs for smaller items that are easy to take for granted. Please consider an in-kind contribution that can make a big difference.
Street Outreach
Donate items that can help us engage people experiencing homelessness who are living with mental illness and addiction. Building trust takes time - our goal is to bring people off the streets and into housing and treatment.
Basic
Needs
Your gift of any of these items helps people in recovery live more independently. Help us respect the dignity of every person by donating only new or gently used goods.
Life Enrichment
Any of these items helps provide safe, sober activities for people learning to live free from drugs and alcohol.
