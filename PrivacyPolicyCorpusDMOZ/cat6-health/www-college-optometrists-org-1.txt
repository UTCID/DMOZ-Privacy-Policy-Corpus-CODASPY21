How will The College of Optometrists use the information it collects about me?
For members
The College of Optometrists will use your personal information for a number of purposes, including the following:
Storing information against your membership record in order to use the information to alert you to, and provide you with information, services and resources from the College and DOCET.
Sharing your details securely with third party data processors contracted to deliver College member services, such as printers and mailing houses.
Sharing your data with other bodies or organisations, such as the GOC, who record and publish your College member status and higher qualifications.
If you opt to have your name and practice details listed on the College’s member directory, this can be viewed by the public.
As a College event delegate, if you give your permission, your name and contact information will be shared with event sponsors and other delegates.
We share member data to meet sector research requests from non commercial third parties, but the data used for this would not leave the College and would, for these demographic and statistical purposes, be anonymised.
We may also pass member data to non-commercial researchers seeking optometrist’s responses to surveys and research requests.
We keep details of calls to the Clinical advice line, together with the response, and the contact details of the enquirer for training and monitoring purposes, or in case we need to get back to the enquirer, or if an issue occurs subsequently.
For non-members
To advise you of new resources and services offered by the College which we believe you should be made aware of, as a member of the profession. From May 2018, at the point you either resign your College membership, or fail to renew it, we will ask you if and how you want to be kept in touch with the College as your professional body. Unless you opt out of receiving these communications, we will only continue to communicate with you if there is a legitimate interest for our doing so.
For members of the public
If you have raised a query, we will use your details, and any other information provided to reply to you to the best of our abilities.
We keep details of calls to the Clinical advice line, together with the response, and the contact details of the enquirer for training and monitoring purposes, or in case we need to get back to the enquirer, or if an issue occurs subsequently.

For DOCET users
The College provides Secretariat services for DOCET. The College and DOCET use the same database.
If you make a DOCET communication preference request this will be added to the shared database and used for DOCET communications only.
If you are a member of the College, and update your details through either the College or DOCET, this will be updated on your database record and will be used by both organisations.
