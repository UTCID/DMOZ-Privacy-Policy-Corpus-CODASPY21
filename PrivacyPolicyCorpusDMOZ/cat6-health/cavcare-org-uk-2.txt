Cookie Policy
Home > Cookie Policy
Any information that we collect through the use cookies is completely anonymous and not personally identifiable. Our systems will not store your name, address, telephone number, or email address unless volunteered to us by you. This shall be treated as proprietary and confidential; we do not sell or share your details with any third parties. Additionally, none of the cookies we use gather any information that can be used to advertise services or products to you from our or any other website.
The law
The EU Cookie Law (The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2011) is a new piece of privacy legislation that requires visitors to give consent before allowing a website to store or retrieve any information from any device through the use of cookies. By educating visitors on how information about them is collected through the use of cookies, and allowing them to decide for themselves if they wish to allow it to take place, the aim is to protect online privacy for everyone.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files, downloaded to your computer by the browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox etc.) whenever you access a website. They enable websites to store such information as user preferences and login details. They may also be used to record how long you spend browsing each page on a site or what pages you visit most. Cookies can be thought of as providing a “memory” for the website, enabling it to recognise you and respond appropriately. Generally, cookies are most beneficial to you, the visitor, making your interaction with frequently-visited sites smoother and easier than they would be without them.
How this website uses cookies
Website statistics
We use Google Analytics, a third party service which creates its own set of cookies for the purpose of compiling a number of statistical reports. The information gathered is completely anonymous and is used to assess a wide variety of website activities, including how our site is navigated and what pages are most popular. If you would prefer that Google did not track about your browsing habits, you can install a browser add-on to opt-out.
Finding our offices
We use Google maps on our contact us page to provide detailed information on how best to visit our offices. Google set a cookie that allows them to remember which browser you are using and what preferences you have set when you view maps. We use Google maps tools on the basis that Google adheres to its privacy policy and its terms of service.
Social media
We may also use a number of third party, social media plug-ins including but not limited to Google’s “+1” button, Facebook’s “Like Box”, Twitter’s “Follow Button” and LinkedIn’s “Share” and “Follow” buttons. We use these services for the convenience of our visitors, allowing them to access up to the minute information as well as recommend our services to others.
