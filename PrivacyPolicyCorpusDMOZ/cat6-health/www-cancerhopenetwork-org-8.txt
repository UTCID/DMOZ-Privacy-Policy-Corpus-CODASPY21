Ways to Help
Planned Giving
Donate
Your contribution creates hope.There are myriad types of cancer – prostate and breast, leukemia and lung, carcinoma and more. For more than 80 types and subtypes of cancer, Cancer Hope Network has a trained Support Volunteer, ready and willing to help. For cancer patients and their loved ones, our volunteers offer an opportunity for connection and comfort, insight and inspiration.
The service CHN Support Volunteers provide is free, but the training and support our survivor and caregiver volunteers receive isn’t. Your support makes it possible.
Below, a few of the many ways you can help make hope happen.
Questions? Contact Sarah Miretti Cassidy, Director of External Affairs – 908.879.4039 ex 20 or scassidy@cancerhopenetwork.org.
