For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

Where we are about to enter or have entered into a contract for the delivery of veterinary services with you.
Where processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) as well as your interests, and your fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Marketing
We may process your personal data in order to make suggestions and recommendations to you about products or services that may be of interest to you (‘direct marketing’). In these cases, the lawful basis we rely on is ‘consent’. Before we process your data for direct marketing purposes, we will require your consent to do so. Consent means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to yourself.
Promotional offers from us
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need for your pet(s), or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You will only receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased products or services from us and specifically ‘opted in’ to receive such communications.
Third-party marketing
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any other company for marketing purposes.
Opting out
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time or adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out or ‘unsubscribe’ links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
Cookies
Our website uses essential cookies to enable core functionalities such as security, network management, and accessibility. Our website may also use non-essential cookies, such as Google Analytics, to help us to improve our website by collecting and reporting information on how you use it. Finally, our website may use marketing cookies in order to promote products which you may find interesting. These cookies will in almost all cases only collect anonymous data. For more information about the cookies we use, and how to disable them, please see our cookie policy
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it. However, we may sometimes find that our purposes for collecting and using data changes over time. If we originally collected and used your personal data on the lawful basis of consent, we will always ask you for ‘fresh’ consent for the processing of your personal data for any new purpose. If we did not originally collect your personal data on the basis of consent, we may only use your personal data for a new purpose if this new purpose is compatible with the original purpose. When assessing whether the original and new purpose are compatible, we will consider the differences between the original and the new purpose; the reasonable expectations that you would have with regards to our handling of your data; and the impact on the individuals whose data we are processing. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated, ‘incompatible’ purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Disclosures of your personal data
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
Specific third parties such as VetPartners Limited (the company that owns VetPartners Practices Limited t/a Oakwood Veterinary Referrals), our Practice Management System, our website builder, and our communications provider. If you would like to have more information about these specific third parties please contact us.
Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
Where this is required by law, we may share your personal data with relevant law enforcement agencies without your knowledge or consent.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions, set out in a Data Sharing Agreement.
International transfers
We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) without having appropriate safeguards in place to allow for restricted transfers of personal data.
Data security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
Data retention
How long will you retain my personal data?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
We keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Pet, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for legal and tax purposes.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We are usually able to respond to all requests within one calendar month from confirming the validity of the request. In the rare occasions where a request is particularly complex or voluminous, we may need to extend this deadline by an additional two calendar months. If this is the case, we will notify you as soon as possible, and in any event within 30 days.
