Enrolment Conditions for your Student Visa
Enrolment Conditions for your Student Visa
The information on this page has been put together exclusively for international students, who are required to adhere to specific enrolment conditions to avoid risking their COE being cancelled. In addition, information is provided about support that is tailored to international students' needs and circumstances.General information about enrolment, fees and money matters
Enrolment conditions for international studentsCompleting your course on timeInternational students must strive, at all times, to complete their studies within the completion date as specified on their Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) document. This means that under normal circumstances you ought to complete at least 8 credit points per (academic) year. Should you wish to vary your enrolment, or spread out your load over 3 trimesters, you will need to talk to a student adviser.Should you deliberately under-enrol, not follow course advice from your faculty, or not make up for units in Trimester 3 to ensure completion of at least 8 credit points for the year, you may not be able to obtain an extension of your COE. Where possible, you will then have to complete your studies from your home country as a Cloud Campus student.Enrolment in cloud unitsTrimester 1 and 2 are compulsory study periods. You must always include at least one on-campus unit during your studies in Trimester 1 and 2. At no time can international students study only one cloud unit in a compulsory study period (unless it is the students final unit to complete).Please note where a student has not completed 8 credit points over trimester 1 and 2, Trimester 3 will become a compulsory study period in order to complete studies by the end date listed on the students CoE.For more information about fees and date for Start Anytime units, please see Start Anytime Dates.One third (or equivalent) ruleInternational students may study one third (or equivalent) of their course online. However you must be enrolled in at least one face to face unit in each compulsory study period, unless you are completing your final unit of study. If you exceed this rule, you will not be eligible for a new COE. This means that you will need to return to your home country and complete your course as a Cloud Campus student.Start anytime unitsThe list of start anytime units are listed here. International students who intend to enrol in a start anytime unit need to ensure they follow enrolment rules for compliance with visa conditions:You must be enrolled in at least one face-to-face unit in a compulsory trimester (unless undertaking your final unit). A Start Anytime unit is not a face-to-face unit and enrolment is not considered a compulsory trimester.You need to complete your course by the course end date (listed on your Certificate of Enrolment (COE)). If you enrol in a Start Anytime unit with a flexible end date, you need to ensure you complete all requirements of the unit by your course end date."Please also note your academic course progress is assessed in accordance with the academic progress procedure. In monitoring academic progress, units offered in Start Anytime mode will be considered a unit enrolment in the study period when the unit is completed.
For more detailed information about any of the above enrolment conditions, or possible breaches of these conditions, please contact the Deakin International Quality and Compliance team.
Academic progressAll students are required to make successful academic progress. That is, they must pass a minimum number of units each trimester in order to successfully complete their course of study within a reasonable timeframe.The University is required to cancel an international student's COE if they have been excluded because of unsatisfactory academic progress or academic misconduct. In these situations, students must make arrangements for enrolment into a new course either at Deakin or with another provider within 28 days of their COE cancellation. Should students fail to enrol in a new course within 28 days of the cancellation of their COE, their student visa may be cancelled. For further information, please contact Deakin International Quality and Compliance.
SupportInternational students may face specific hurdles having chosen to undertake their studies in a country other than home. A new culture and environment awaits them, they must build new networks of friends, and become accustomed to the Australian accent and vernacular. At university, they will encounter a different academic culture and are required to grasp different academic expectations. Sometimes specific situations call for specific support. Study SupportAll students, both local and international, will need to familiarise themselves with the academic expectations at Deakin. Language and Learning Advisers are professional staff who are here to help you adjust to those expectations and develop your academic skills. If you are from a non-English speaking background, it is also important to spend time developing your English language skills. There are many fun and informal ways to engage with the English language. You may wish to check out the Peer Study programs where you will find senior students who are keen to answer any of your questions. International student supportOur team members have lived and studied in other countries and have experienced firsthand the cultural and other adjustments required when moving to another country. We are familiar with many of the challenges you face in making Australia your home and are here to support you during your studies at Deakin.
