Release of Personal Health Information
(Effective April 14, 2003)
Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. has a legal duty to protect and safeguard your personal health information, which includes past and present information obtained during your treatment stay. We must provide you with this notice about our privacy practices, in that it will explain how and why we use and disclose your personal health information. Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. is committed to protecting the confidentiality of information contained in your medical records, including your health and financial information, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. is required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information; we are required to abide by the terms of this notice currently in effect and reserve the right to change the terms of its notice and to make new notice provisions effective for all protected health information that it maintains.
How we will use and disclose your health information. (Some uses and disclosures will require a specific authorization.):
Treatment: Your health information will be released for the purpose of treatment at our facility, to include all members of your treatment team. Treatment team members include but are not limited to Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. medical providers, therapists, nurses, dietician/nutritionist, case managers, medical records staff, intake personnel, and administrative/clinical personnel.
Limited access to your health information may include but is not limited to Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. business office personnel (admissions, collections), receptionists, and administrative/clinical assistants.
Family members participating in the Family Program will have limited knowledge regarding your health information, as revealed by you, the client, in the program groups.
While you are in treatment, your health information is released to Dominion Diagnostics, which is an external laboratory facility that is utilized by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. for the purpose of lab studies. An authorization to release information is only signed by you, the client, if you choose to have Dominion Diagnostic bill your insurance carrier.
While in treatment, your health information is released to Walgreen’s’ Pharmacy, which is an external pharmacy utilized by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc for the purpose of obtaining prescription medications.
While in treatment, your private health information may be released to Dr. Richard Keesal, an external physician who is utilized by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. for the purpose of history and physicals and other medical concerns that may arise while the client is in treatment.
While in treatment, you may require a medical service that is not provided by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc; with your approval, your attending provider will recommend an external provider of care, and your health information will be released in order to provide care.
In the event that while in treatment you need to be either voluntarily transferred (for safety and further stabilization) or involuntarily transferred (due to danger to self, danger to others, refusing to remain on one-to-one evaluation, or if the need for a higher level of care is required), then an immediate response agency will be contacted. Emergency Crisis Management will be notified to complete an assessment. If they are not available, 911 will be contacted to transfer you to the appropriate facility.
Medical Emergencies: We may use or disclose your protected health information in a medical emergency situation to medical personnel only. Our staff will try to provide you a copy of this notice as soon as reasonably practicable after the resolution of the emergency.
Your health information will be released to referring professionals, therapists, medical providers, and extended care facilities for the purpose of continuity of care after discharge when you have given proper authorization.
Criminal Activity on Program Premises/Against Program Personnel: We may disclose your protected health information to law enforcement officials if you have committed a crime on program premises or against program personnel.
Court Order: We may disclose your protected health information if the court issues an appropriate order and follows required procedures.
Payment: Your health information will be disclosed for the purpose of payment from your insurance carrier or third party for reimbursement purposes when proper authorization has been given. While in treatment and after you discharge, your health information will be released to process your insurance, to conduct third party reviews, and for other financial arrangements, as authorized by you, the patient. In the event that your bill for services rendered by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. has not been resolved in a timely manner, the information in your financial record will be copied and sent to an external collection agency and/or attorney for collection services.
Healthcare Operations: Your health information will be used and disclosed for the purpose of healthcare operations to include administrative functions such as evaluation of performance by your providers or evaluation of quality of services provided to you during your treatment stay. Your health information may be released for audit purposes to include (but not limited to) the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Florida Department of Health Services for licensure, Yost Accounting for financial audits, and insurance auditors employed by your insurance carrier for comparing the claim to the medical record. Outcome studies are completed by Turning Point of Tampa, Inc. for the purpose of improving our patient care.
Internal Use: Your first name and last initial will be posted on the white boards located in group rooms, admissions office, and clinical team staffing room, 4A office, as well as posted on your therapist’s office door designating your session date and time.

Your medical record, which is located in a secure location, will have your full name for the purpose of ensuring that client care is provided to the correct client.
Your picture will be taken upon admission and stored digitally within Turning Point of Tampa’s client database for the purpose of client identification.

Your first and last name, along with your medical record number, program, house number, admission date, referral source and therapist is contained on the daily census, which is distributed to the treatment team and administrative staff daily.
Your medical record will be kept on site in a secure location for up to seven years post-discharge. Once your record has reached the seven-year limit, it is destroyed (process of shredding).
A financial file will be created upon admission to Turning Point of Tampa, Inc; this file will contain all documents signed during the admissions process relating to payment for services, as well as the claim form that is processed after your discharge.

Substance Use Health Information: The release of medical information concerning substance use may be subject to and released in compliance with the requirements of Federal Law and regulations.
HIV Information: All medical information regarding substance use is kept strictly confidential and released only in conformance with the requirements of federal and state laws. Disclosure of any medical information referencing HIV status may only be made with your written authorization.
