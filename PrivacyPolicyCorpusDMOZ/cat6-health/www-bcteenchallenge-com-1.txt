Why Choose Adult & Teen ChallengeTransformation – Not Treatment Treatment is important, but transformation is key.Adult & Teen Challenge main focus is on Christ. Our programs depend on the power of God’s word to provide our students with a guiding light.

Discipleship & EvangelismThrough our Bible-based curriculum, students learn how to apply God’s Word to their lives. They also learn to recognize the Holy Spirit’s work in their lives, invite God to help them overcome their life-controlling problems, and become more like Christ.
Learn more
Long-Term Residential ProgramsOur residential program is a minimum of 12 months in length with an 18 month additional Successful Living component after graduation. This timeframe provides ample opportunity for men and women to confront their destructive choices, their self-sabotaging behaviour, and their unhealthy views. It then gives them a safe place to establish a new “normal”— assured of the love of God and under the guidance of Biblical principles.
