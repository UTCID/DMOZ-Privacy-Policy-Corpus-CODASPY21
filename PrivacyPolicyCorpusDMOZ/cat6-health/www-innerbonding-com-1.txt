More About Inner Bonding
Inner Bonding is a proven six-step self-healing process that has been developed and optimized over 30 years by Dr. Margaret Paul, Ph.D. and Dr. Erika Chopich, Ph.D. It’s comprehensive. It’s practical. And it always works when you do it.
Inner Bonding empowers you to self-heal the root causes of anxiety, depression, addictions, failed relationships and many other problems that inhibit your personal and spiritual growth and satisfaction. It teaches you how to love yourself rather than continue to abandon yourself, how to move beyond emotional dependency and attain emotional freedom, and how to heal the underlying control issues stemming from self-abandonment.
