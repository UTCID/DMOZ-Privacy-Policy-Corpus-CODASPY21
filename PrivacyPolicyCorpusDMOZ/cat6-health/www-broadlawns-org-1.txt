Receive an electronic or paper copy of your medical record.
You can ask to see or receive an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you. Ask us how to do this.
We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee.
Ask us to correct your medical record.

We may say “no” to your request, but we’ll tell you why in writing within 60 days.

We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.
Ask us to limit what we use or share.
You can ask us not to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would affect your care.
If you pay for a service or healthcare item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a law requires us to share that information.
Request a list of those with whom we’ve shared information.
You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we’ve shared your health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why.
We will include all of the disclosures except for those about treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, and certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make). We’ll provide one accounting per year for free but will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another list within 12 months.

We will make sure the person has this authority and can act for you before we take any action.
File a complaint if you feel your rights are violated.
You can complain if you feel we have violated your rights by contacting us.
