RADIESSE® Volumizing Filler
RADIESSE® volumizing filler is a synthetic injectable filler that has been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for reducing moderate-to-severe wrinkles, folds and creases around the nose and mouth by augmenting the skin’s natural collagen supply. It is a safe, effective and long-lasting alternative to injectable collagen and other dermal fillers for smoothing wrinkles and adding facial volume and contour.
RADIESSE filler is composed of microspheres in a water-based gel; the microspheres are made of a substance called calcium hydroxylapatite, which stimulates the production of collagen. When injected into lines and wrinkles, the additional collagen that is produced smooths out the lines and wrinkles, and adds volume to the skin.
RADIESSE Volumizing Filler Applications
RADIESSE volumizing filler can be used on various areas of the face and body. In addition to correcting scars that leave depressions, it is effective in improving the look of the following:
Nasolabial folds (run from corners of nose to corners of mouth)
Marionette lines (run downward from corners of mouth)
Downturned corners of the mouth
Jowl pre-sagging
Chin wrinkles
RADIESSE filler has also been approved by the FDA to restore and correct the signs of lipoatrophy (loss of fat beneath the skin) in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
RADIESSE Volumizing Filler Procedure
Before a patient is given RADIESSE filler, the treatment area is cleaned. RADIESSE injections are then made with a fine needle, and typically take only 15 minutes to perform. There is little-to-no downtime; many patients return to their normal activities right away. RADIESSE volumizing filler is also FDA-approved for mixing with the anesthetic lidocaine, which makes the injections less painful. Typically, only 1 or 2 treatments are needed to achieve the full benefits of RADIESSE volumizing filler.
RADIESSE Volumizing Filler Results
Results are visible immediately after injection, and sometimes last up to a year. Because results are temporary, treatments must be repeated to sustain them. Touch-up treatments may prolong the effects of RADIESSE filler.
RADIESSE Volumizing Filler Side Effects
Side effects of RADIESSE filler are usually not serious, and go away on their own. They occur at the injection site, and include the following:
Mild irritation
Swelling
Itching
Redness
Bruising
Tenderness
Allergy testing is not necessary before treatment because the calcium hydroxylapatite microspheres in RADIESSE filler are similar to minerals that occur naturally in the body.
