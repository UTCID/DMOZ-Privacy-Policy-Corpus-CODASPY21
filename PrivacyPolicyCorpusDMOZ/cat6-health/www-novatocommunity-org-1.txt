Novato Community Hospital Snapshot
Sutter’s Novato Community Hospital is a not-for-profit community-based hospital
dedicated to providing high-quality, compassionate care.
A lovely small boutique hospital, NCH has a close-knit team that offers one-on-one,
concierge-like care in a quiet, modern setting. Its peaceful, luxurious, spa-like
environment is relaxing and conducive to healing.
Situated on a 10-acre campus. The 40-bed hospital provides 24-hour emergency care,
inpatient and outpatient surgery, critical care, imaging services, laboratory services,
and a physical therapy and sports fitness center.
In addition to general surgery, Novato Community Hospital specializes in orthopedic
surgery and total joint replacement, including hands, hips, shoulders and knees. The
hospital houses three surgery suites, with one specifically designed for minimally
invasive procedures.
Our hospital’s open design emphasizes our commitment to creating a healing
healthcare environment, while our serene meditation room offers space for quiet reflection.
Ambient interiors, serene landscapes and energy conservation are key features of the
hospital.
