HIPAA Privacy Information and Documents
The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is federal legislation which has created a national standard for protecting the privacy of a patient's private health information. Chester County Hospital in West Chester, PA has always been careful to protect a patient's privacy and will continue to strive to do so. This page provides helpful information about your privacy rights and certain key forms that you can use in exercising these rights.
Notice of Privacy Practices
HIPAA requires that every healthcare provider create and distribute a Notice of Privacy Practices. This document describes what the provider may do with your Private Healthcare Information and what rights you have regarding these practices.
