Limitation of Liability
Your use of the Website does not establish a physician-patient relationship between you and Community, or between you and any health care professional employed by or associated with Community. Community will not diagnose or treat any medical conditions or prescribe medication or treatments for anyone through the Website. If you decide to seek information or obtain treatment from any health care provider following a visit to the Website, Community will not follow up or monitor your care as a result of your use of the Website. Community will not accept payment from you and will not bill any insurance company, government payment program or other source of health benefits in compensation for providing services to you through the Website.
You should not share personal medical information of a kind you would wish to be held confidential in a physician-patient or similar relationship. Because your use of the Website does not create a physician-patient relationship between you and Community, or between you and or any health care professional employed by or associated with Community, the information you provide will not be considered a medical record.
The Website should not be considered to be your treating health care professional and will not communicate with your health care professional. The information you obtain from the Website is not a substitute for nor should it be used instead of a relationship with a health care professional. All users are encouraged to seek the advice of, and regularly consult with, physicians and other health care professionals of their own choosing.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE WEBSITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INFORMATION TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE INTERNET IS NEVER COMPLETELY SECURE.

General
The laws of the State of Indiana shall govern the validity, performance, enforcement, interpretation and any other aspect of these Terms, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action accrues or be forever barred.
You acknowledge and agree that the provisions, disclosures and disclaimers set forth in these Terms are fair and reasonable and your agreement to follow and be bound by them is not the result of fraud, duress or undue influence exercised upon you by any person or entity. The failure of Community to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
Community shall have the right to assign these Terms and to sublicense any and all of its rights under these Terms. These Terms, including any documents referenced herein and any additional terms, conditions, or policies posted on the Website by Community from time to time, represent the entire understanding between you and Community regarding your relationship with Community and your use of the Website.
