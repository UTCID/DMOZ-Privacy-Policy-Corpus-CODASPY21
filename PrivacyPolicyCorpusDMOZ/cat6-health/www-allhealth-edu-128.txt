Introduction
The Allegheny Health Network Medical Education Consortium is committed to providing all residents with a balanced comprehensive professional education which is based on the principles of contemporary adult education. The goal is to create a learning environment in which residents will learn the fundamental principles that govern the practice of medicine, and also develop the clinical skills to provide the full continuity of patient care. This learning environment fosters
educational development by incorporating the principles of a commitment to
lifelong learning, the value of cooperative, collaborative team work, and the
importance of the psychosocial aspects of patient care.
