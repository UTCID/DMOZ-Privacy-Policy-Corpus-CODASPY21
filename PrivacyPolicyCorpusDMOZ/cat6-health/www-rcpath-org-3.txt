Cookies policy
This privacy notice tells you what to expect when our website collects personal information. It applies to information we collect about our visitors, and those who log in to our website.
How we use your information
Our website uses cookies which allow us to monitor the use of the RCPath website. This is for general purposes only and the information we gather cannot be used to identify you as an individual. We also use a number of third party tools to display content (Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, ShareThis and Soundcloud), Google Analytics and Hotjar to provide us with further analysis on how our users are accessing our content. These tools all place cookies on your computer.
By using this website you consent to the processing of data by Google Analytics, Hotjar, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, ShareThis and Soundcloud. If you do not want these sites to collect your data, follow the instructions below to block specific cookies – though please note that your experience on our website may be impaired as a result.
About cookies
What is a cookie?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
Why are cookies needed?
Cookies make websites work better. For example, when you add an item to your shopping cart on the Amazon website, the contents of the shopping cart are stored in the cookie. When you log into a webmail service such as Hotmail or gmail, a cookie is generated that confirms you are logged in. When you log off the cookie is deleted. This means if someone goes back to your webmail address on your computer, you will still be logged out – and they won’t be able to read your emails.
I don’t consent to the use of cookies – what can I do?
If you want to turn off cookies for a particular website or tool, you can do so yourself using your browser settings. You can do this for one site or several sites – although it’s important to note that your experience of the website may be impaired because data is no longer being captured about your interactions.

We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personally identifying information from any source.
