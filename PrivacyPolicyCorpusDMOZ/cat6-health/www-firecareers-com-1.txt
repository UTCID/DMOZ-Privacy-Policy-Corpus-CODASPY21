The Firecareers Bulletin Board, Firecareers Chat, Firehouse

passive conduit for the online publication and distribution of
user-submitted information. As such, the Company assumes no obligation
to screen information or communications in advance and is not
responsible for monitoring, screening or editing material posted by
users. If notified by a user of a communication that allegedly does not
conform to these Terms and Conditions, the Company may investigate the

whether to remove or request the removal of the particular
communication. However, the Company assumes no responsibility or
liability to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities.

prevent further access by them to the Firecareers.com website or the
Perfect Firefighter Candidate service for violating these Terms and
Conditions or any law. The Company reserves the right to edit or remove
communications which it deems, in its sole discretion, are illegal,
abusive, disruptive, or are in violation of these Terms and Conditions.
The Company may take any action with respect to user-submitted
information that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole
discretion if it believes it may create liability for the Company or its
customers, users, or subscribers, or may cause the Company to lose (in
whole or in part) the services of its Internet Service Provider or other
vendors or suppliers, or is in any way potentially injurious to the
Company.
By submitting content to any public or non-public area of
the Firecareers.com website, including without limitation the Community
Sections, You grant the Company and its affiliates the perpetual,
royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers),
non-exclusive license and right (including any moral right) to publish,
reproduce, use, distribute, communicate to the public, adapt, translate,
modify, create derivative works from, display and perform the content
(in whole or in part) worldwide and to incorporate it in other works in
any media, form, or technology now known or later developed, for the
full term of any rights that may exist in such content. You also warrant
that the holder of any rights, including moral rights in such content,
has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and
irrevocably granted to You the right to grant the license stated above.
You also permit any subscriber to access, view, display, store and
reproduce such content for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the
owner of such content placed on the Firecareers.com website retains any
and all rights that may exist in such content.

of confidence on our part and we shall not be liable for any use or
