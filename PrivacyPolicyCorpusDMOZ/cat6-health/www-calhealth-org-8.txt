E-mail from the site might be caught in your spam/junk mail box. Please check your spam/junk mail box to see if the e-mail ended up there. If it did, please mark it as not spam so future e-mails will be more likely to come through.
Add the site's email address (info@calhospital.org) to your address book. This will make it more likely for your e-mail system to treat it as legitimate mail if you're having a trouble with it going into the spam folder.
I'm logging in, but nothing happens and I don't get an error message
