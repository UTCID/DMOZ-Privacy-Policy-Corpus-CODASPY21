Privacy Policy:Center Span Inc. ("Center Span") operates CenterSpan.org and may operate other websites. It is Center Span's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Center Span collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Center Span's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Center Span's visitors use its website. From time to time, Center Span may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Center Span also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on CenterSpan.org blogs/sites. Center Span only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Center Span's websites choose to interact with Center Span in ways that require Center Span to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Center Span gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
at CenterSpan.org to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Center Span are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Center Span collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Center Span. Center Span does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Center Span may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Center Span may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Center Span does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Center Span discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Center Span's behalf or to provide services available at Center Span's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Center Span's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Center Span will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Center Span discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Center Span believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Center Span, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Center Span website and have supplied your email address, Center Span may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Center Span and our products.
If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Center Span takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Center Span uses cookies to help Center Span identify and track visitors, their usage of Center Span website, and their website access preferences. Center Span visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Center Span's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Center Span's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

If Center Span, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Center Span goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Center Span may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
