Privacy policy
We have developed this policy so that you may feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information.
Countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) are required to have a similar standard of protection of personal data. This is not always the case outside that area. We do sometimes transfer data outside the EEA and before doing so take steps to ensure that there is adequate protection, as required by relevant Data Protection legislation.
Use of Personal Information
You may need to register to access our website and where you do not register personal information about you will not be collected by us.
If you register for our services, any details you provide may be stored for use on future visits, as we do not want you to give us any information more than once. The details you give us may be combined with information about your use of the Meningitis Research Foundation website(s) and information from other of our records in order to provide you with online services you request.
Email addresses
We respect the privacy of personal email accounts and we store your email addresses just as securely as other personal information. We will not send you unwanted email messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to any organisation outside the Group for marketing purposes without your explicit permission.
However, we may use email in response to enquiries you make about our services or service issues.
Disclosure of information
We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.
We sometimes use other companies to provide some of our services or to provide services to us. To enable them to do this, we may need to let them process your personal information. Our staff and those working for our agents or contractors have a responsibility to keep your information confidential and are only allowed to use it to offer products and services on our behalf.
Right of access to your information
If you want to know exactly what personal information Meningitis Research Foundation holds on you, you can obtain it. If it transpires that the information held is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you that these have been made. Please write to the Data Protection Officer at the Meningitis Research Foundation.
How we protect your data
Our general Email enquiry forms are not sent via an encrypted channel and for this reason we ask that you do not include confidential information when using them (such as bank account details).
Messages sent and received via the message service when you are logged into your accounts via our internet banking service are encrypted and therefore secure.
