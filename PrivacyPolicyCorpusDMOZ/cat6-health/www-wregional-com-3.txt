Medicare Insurance Helpline
We understand how complex and confusing Medicare can be. There are many different types of Medicare insurance available, including Medicare Advantage, Supplements and Prescription Drug plans. Dozens of insurance companies offer Medicare coverage and to further complicate matters, healthcare providers do not typically accept all Medicare plans.
In coordination with MedicareCompareUSA, Washington Regional is pleased to offer the Medicare Insurance Helpline; a free and unbiased resource for comparing and enrolling in Medicare plans accepted by Washington Regional providers. The Medicare Insurance Helpline gets you connected with professional and preferred Medicare resources to help you every step of the way.
