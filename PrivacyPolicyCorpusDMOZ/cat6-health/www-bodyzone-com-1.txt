The information and recommendations contained in this site are not intended to be a substitute for diagnosis and/or treatment by a doctor or other health care professional. Some of the recommendations may not be appropriate for all individuals, or in all situations. Diagnosis and treatment of all health conditions should only be performed by a licensed healthcare professional.
You should not use the information, resources or tools contained within to self-diagnose or self-treat any health problem or disease.

The directory listings are provided and maintained by the professional. Professionals, their associates and representatives, have a legal and ethical responsibility, to submit true and correct information.
Choosing a professional is an important decision and should not be based solely upon a listing or advertisement. Always make your own investigation before choosing a chiropractor, massage therapist, or posture exercise therapist or instructor. For more information about a particular professional or profession, contact your local or state associations.

Rental fee will be charged for each and every occurrence of unauthorized use of the directory.
The rental fee is based on the approximate time, effort, expense and all other factors relating to compiling the data in the directory. Rental fees charged for unauthorized use of the directory, in addition to reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred to recover rental fees, shall be due and payable immediately upon demand. The rental fee shall serve as liquidated damages for the losses suffered by BodyZone.com as a result of the unauthorized use of the information contained in the website. Member agrees that in addition to other damages provided by law, that the rental fee of $7.00 per use of name is a fair and equitable assessment of damages suffered by BodyZone.com as a result of Member’s unauthorized use of BodyZone.com website information.
