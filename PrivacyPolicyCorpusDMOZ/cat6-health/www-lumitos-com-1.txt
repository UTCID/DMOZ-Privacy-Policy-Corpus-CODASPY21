Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the collection, collection and evaluation of data on the behaviour of visitors to Internet sites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on the website from which a person concerned has accessed a website (so-called referrer), which subpages of the website have been accessed or how often and for how long a subpage has been viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.The Google Analytics component is operated by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.We use the addition “_gat._anonymizeIp” for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, Google shortens and anonymizes the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned when accessing our Internet pages from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.2. Legal basis for the processing of personal dataThe legal basis for processing users’ personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.3. Purpose of data processingThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the flow of visitors to our website.

What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyse the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the data controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which serves Google, among other things, to trace the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission statements.Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access came and the frequency of visits to our website by the person concerned. Whenever you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.4. Duration of storageThe data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer needed for our recording purposes. In our case, this is the case after 60 months.5. Possibility of revocation and deletionThe user can prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time, as already described above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a cookie on the user’s information technology system. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.Furthermore, the user has the possibility to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent this. To do this, the user must download and install a browser add-on from the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information on visits to websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered a contradiction by Google. If the user’s information technology system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later time, the user must reinstall the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the user or another person within their control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.Further information and Google’s current privacy policy can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en and https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html Google Analytics will be explained in more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/en_en/analytics/.XI.   Web analysis with Webtrends Analytics1.

What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain pages on our website have been accessed. The conversion cookie enables us and Google to track whether a person who has sent a contact form via an AdWords ad to our website.The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to generate visit statistics for our website. We use these visit statistics to determine the total number of users who have been referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the person concerned.The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the person concerned. Personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is therefore transferred to Google in the United States of America each time he or she visits our Internet pages.

Duration of storage, possibility of revocation and deletionThe user can prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the user’s information technology system. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.Furthermore, the user has the possibility to object to interest-related advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must access the www.google.de/settings/ads link from each of the Internet browsers they use and make the required settings there.Further information and Google’s current privacy policy can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/XIII.
