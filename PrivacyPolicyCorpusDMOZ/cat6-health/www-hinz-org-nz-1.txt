Privacy Act
Health Informatics New Zealand (HiNZ) is committed to protecting your privacy. Your personal data is protected in New Zealand by the Privacy Act. This provides, amongst other things, that the data we hold about you should be processed lawfully and fairly. It should be accurate, relevant and not excessive. The information should be kept up to date, where necessary, and not retained for longer than is necessary. You have the right to see what is held about you and correct any inaccuracies. HiNZ treats all the data held with the utmost care and security. Any details you give will remain confidential. If you have questions about your data please contact us anytime.
Member data
If you are an individual member of HiNZ you will be provided with a Username and Password for the HiNZ website. The default setting for Member Profile visibility is set to 'Members only'. Members also have the option to 'toggle' these settings to 'on/off' under their Member Profile once they are signed in to the site. Visitors to the site who perform a site search will see the member's name but will not have access to the member's profile. If you are a member and your email address is set to 'Private' (not visible in profile) it will not be displayed to other members, but members can still contact you via email through the site's group email system.
eNewsletter data
All HiNZ members, HiNZ event delegates and eNewsletter subscribers automatically receive our fortnightly email newsletter. We may contact our eNewsletter database from time to time with promotional offers from HiNZ or HiNZ sponsors. If you decide you no longer wish to receive the eNewsletter please follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the email.
Event registration data
When you attend a HiNZ event, your name, job title and organisation name may be included in our published delegates list, but your email address and other contact details always remain private. These are not visible to exhibitors and sponsors. Our conference app enables delegates to message each other securely and privately without disclosing your email address (unless you opt in to provide it).
