you have provided your consent which can be withdrawn at any time,
the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party,

analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our Site,

Unless we think that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process or to protect the interests of ACE or others, we will not release your Personal Data without your consent.
We are headquartered in the United States. Your Personal Data may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States to our affiliates, partners, merchants or service providers who are located worldwide. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United Sates, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Service, you consent to any transfer of this information.
We will store your Personal Data, in a form which permits us to identify you, for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the Personal Data is processed. We may retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your Personal Data quickly upon request.
Your European Rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your Personal Data) if we intend to use your Personal Data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking or not checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your Personal Data. You can also contact us as listed in this Privacy Policy.
Under European data protection law, in certain circumstances, you have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Data
Request correction of your Personal Data
Request erasure of your Personal Data
Object to processing of your Personal Data
Request restriction of processing your Personal Data
Request transfer of your Personal Data
In addition, where you believe that ACE has not complied with its obligations under this Privacy Policy or European law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority.
Cookies
Like many websites, our Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Site. This helps us to analyze the use of the Site to customize and improve the content and the layout of the Site.
You do not have to accept our cookies and can block them by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse some or all cookies. You may also delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive. If you do not accept our cookies, or delete them, some areas of the Site that you access may take more time to work or may not work at all.
We use the following cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies
Analytical/performance cookies
Functionality cookies
Targeting cookies
Third party cookies
“Do not track” signals
We do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. As such, your navigation of our Site may be tracked as part of gathering of quantitative user information described above. If you arrive to our Site from a link from a third party site that does respond to “do not track” requests, that will end once you reach our site.
Rules for Submissions and Messages
Responsibility for what is posted in the discussion groups or other public forums lies with each user--you alone are responsible for the content of your messages, and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do not review every submission a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or propriety of any submission. We do, however, reserve the right but do not assume the obligation to delete submissions and restrict or prohibit your use of our sites for legal or other reasons.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to us over the internet. You are responsible for keeping your password secret. Never give your password to anyone, even someone claiming to be an ACE employee.
Web Linking
ACE may link to other web sites. These sites may collect user information or solicit personal information. Since we do not control these sites we are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If we learn that Personal Data of persons less than 13 years old has been collected through our Site, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
How To Access Or Correct Your Information
You may access or correct your Personal Data that we maintain by contacting our customer service department at support@ACEfitness.org or by visiting the ACE store and clicking on My Account. To better protect your privacy and security, your email address must match the email address used to establish your account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
