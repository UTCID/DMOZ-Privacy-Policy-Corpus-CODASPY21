Web Privacy Policy
McLaren Health Care Corporation cares about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us.
This Privacy Policy and Terms (the “Policy”) describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our website located at www.mclaren.org, the websites of our subsidiaries that display or directly link to this Policy, and the e-mail messages that we send to you that directly link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”).
There are a number of circumstances where this Policy does not apply and we want to identify a few of them for you:
This Policy does not apply to the information you share when receiving treatment from your medical provider, including when you are receiving medical services from us. For example, this Policy would not apply to the information you share with us when admitted to the emergency room. The use and disclosure of the information you provide in such circumstances is governed by the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, more commonly known as HIPAA, as well as Michigan law. You can learn more about your HIPAA rights and protections and our obligations in our Notice of Privacy Practices.
This Policy does not apply to the information you share and your use of the My McLaren Chart, which is the patient portal we offer. The use and disclosure of the information you provide when using the My McLaren Chart is governed by HIPAA, Michigan state law, as well as the terms and conditions and other policies you agreed to when registering to access the My McLaren Chart service.
This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control. Other services and organizations that we link to may have their own privacy policies governing the use of information you provide to them. For example, organizations such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn each have their own privacy policy and practices.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to individuals whom we do not employ, including any of the third parties to whom we may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If you have any questions or comments about this Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us by using one of the means listed on our Contact page
Personally Identifiable Information We May Collect
“Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as name, birth date, telephone number, e-mail address, or unique device identifiers that was gathered in connection with your use of the Services.
If we combine Personally Identifiable Information with protected health information subject to protection under HIPAA, the combined information will be treated as protected health information for as long as it remains combined.
Other Information we may collect
“Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, including, for example: (1) computer or device connection information, such as browser type and version, operating system type and version, device information, and other technical identifiers; (2) information collected through cookies and other technologies; or (3) aggregated information, such as usage history and search history.
If we combine Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information for as long as it remains combined.
Security Measures
Virus Detection and E-mail Security: For website security, we use software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
General Practices: Although we seek to use reasonable measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the information you provide to us through the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.
Security of Service Communications: Some communication through the Services may be sent through the standard HTTP protocol and may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP is not encrypted. E-mail, while convenient, also poses several risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). We cannot guarantee the security of the information sent through such means, nor can we guarantee that information you supply to us will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and to take appropriate security measures to protect your information. We use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your protected health information during data transport with My McLaren Chart.
Your Obligations to Safeguard your Information: Security is not a one person job. You must also take reasonable measures to protect your information, including, for example, securing your computer and mobile device, using an antivirus software, using a firewall, and other similar safeguards.
