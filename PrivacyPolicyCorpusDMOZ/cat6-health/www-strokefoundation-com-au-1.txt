Our promise to you
We will be transparent with your funds. We are proud to hold the Registered Charity Tick from the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission
– the independent national regulator of charities established by the Australian Government.
It identifies charities like us that are transparent, accountable, and meet the ACNC’s governance standards and reporting requirements. Read our reports to the ACNC.
We’ll keep in touch through newsletters, emails or calls to show you the impact you are making. We will also ask you for your feedback each year via a short survey.
We will guard your privacy. We won’t share your details with other charities and marketers. Read our Privacy Policy.
We will publish independently audited accounts each year on our website so that you will know how your donation is being used. Read our latest Annual Report and audited accounts.
We will be here for you to answer your questions, listen to your ideas or just say ‘hello’.
