Privacy Policy
Animal Medical Center respects the privacy of its customers and visitors. Animal Medical Center collects and stores only the information provided by you via our online forms; including but not limited to your name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any comments or questions you may include in your contact with us.
This information is used by Animal Medical Center to provide information and service offerings tailored to your specific needs. Your information will be treated confidentially and will never be sold or transferred to any third party. Animal Medical Center does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies except when we have your permission, or unless Animal Medical Center is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Animal Medical Center will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
Animal Medical Center may update this policy. We will notify you about any significant policy changes by sending a notice to the primary email address you provided, or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
