Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyTHE CANADIAN CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATIONPRIVACY POLICYBackground
At the Canadian Chiropractic Association, we are committed to safeguarding and protecting the privacy of Personal Information (defined below) that is provided to us in the course of the CCA’s operations. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to: (i) the CCA’s website found at: www.chiropractic.ca, including all webpages forming part of that website (“Webpages”); and (ii) any other websites, digital properties, audio offerings, mobile applications and/or mobile enabled sites that are owned and/or operated by CCA and that do not have a separate privacy policy (collectively, the “Website”). Webpages may contain policies or terms that are specific to their content (e.g. payment terms), and, unless expressly stated otherwise, such policies and/or terms are in addition to and not a substitution for the Privacy Policy.By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, and you agree and consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with the terms set out below. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services or supply your Personal Information to us. By submitting Personal Information about another individual, you must only do so if you have the consent of that individual (or their substitute decision-maker, where applicable). Failure to obtain such consents is your responsibility, and not that of the CCA.PurposeThe purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of Personal Information we collect, use, and disclose in providing you with the Services. It explains:how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information;the choices you have regarding the use and disclosure of Personal Information; andHow you may correct Personal Information.Amendments to Privacy PolicyFrom time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is current as of the “last revised” date which appears at the top of this page. We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected, unless we have your consent to treat it differently.The following topics will be covered in this Privacy Statement:What is Personal Information and what Personal Information do we collect?How and when do we collect Personal Information?Where do we store Personal Information?For what purposes do we collect your Personal Information?What safeguards have we implemented to protect the Personal Information that you provide?Who will have access to the Personal Information that you provide?To whom do we disclose Personal Information that you provide?When and how do we obtain your consent?CookiesHow long will we use, disclose or retain Personal Information that you provide to us?How can you review your Personal Information that we have collected, used or disclosed?How do you know that the Personal Information we have on you is accurate? What happens if such Personal Information is inaccurate?How do you contact us regarding access to your Personal Information or our privacy practices?Other Information 1. What is Personal Information and what Personal Information do we collect?“Personal Information” is any information that about an identifiable individual. The type of Personal Information that we may collect may include, for example:name;contact information, such as email address and residential address;phone numbers;credit card information and bank account information (i.e. where provided to us in the course of paying membership dues);social media identifiers (e.g. Twitter handle and Facebook profile, etc.);internet protocol (IP) address; andother information that falls within the definition of “Personal Information” that we did not request, but that you provide to us.Personal Information does not include business contact information (such as information regarding where an individual practices their profession and/or the contact information for that practice) and certain publicly available information. 2. How and when do we collect Personal Information?We will always collect Personal Information by fair and lawful means. We may collect Personal Information from you directly and/or from third parties, where we (and/or those third parties) have obtained your consent to do so, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. For example, we collect your Personal Information from the provincial chiropractic associations in Canada (e.g. Ontario Chiropractic Association, New Brunswick Chiropractors Association) and the Canadian Chiropractic Protective Association (“CCPA”).Generally, however, we collect Personal Information directly from you when you voluntarily provide it in the course of using the Services. For example, Personal Information may be collected when:you register for an account through the Website;you submit a membership application through the Website;you pay your annual membership dues through the Website;you register to receive our newsletter or any other CCA publications; andyou communicate with representatives of the CCA, via telephone, email or mail.In any event, we limit our collection of Personal Information to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. We collect, use and disclose your Personal Information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.3. Where do we store Personal Information?We store Personal Information that you provide on our servers (or those of our service providers) in Canada.4. For what purposes do we collect your Personal Information?Generally, we identify the purposes for which we use the Personal Information that you provide at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use. We generally use Personal Information for the following purposes (the “Purposes”):to register and administer your membership with the CCA, including the payment of membership dues;to offer and provide membership services to you, which include providing information to you regarding products and services for which the CCA has obtained a preferential benefit (for example, a discount) for its members;providing information to you regarding products, services and events (including, for example, those of the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (“CCRF”), the Journal of Canadian Chiropractic Association, the Canadian Chiropractic Guidelines Initiative, and the World Federation of Chiropractic), that the CCA believes may be of interest to you in your capacity as a chiropractic professional;to verify your identity and the accuracy of your Personal Information with our records, through using this information to contact you directly for that purpose, or for the purpose of collecting additional personal information;to send you information and updates regarding the activities of the CCA;to respond to your inquiries, questions, and/or other requests;to confirm with the CCPA your eligibility for membership in, and to verify your enrollment with, the CCPA;to reconcile member information/status (e.g. full-time, part-time) with the provincial chiropractic associations in Canada;in aggregated, non-identifiable form, to better understand how our users use the resources provided on the Website;for fundraising purposes, but only in respect of fundraising carried out by the CCRF (of which the CCA is a beneficiary);for such other uses of Personal Information for which you provide your consent from time to time; andas otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. 5. What safeguards have we implemented to protect the Personal Information that you provide?
We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures in an effort to protect your Personal Information from loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. For example, we have implemented the following safeguards:premises security;security software and firewalls to protect hacking or other unauthorized computer access; andpassword protected and encrypted computers.The safeguards we implement to protect your Personal Information reflect industry standards. For example, if you provide credit card information to us, such information is: (i) encrypted (using socket layer (SSL)); and (ii) stored in Infusionsoft (which software completed a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) level-one onsite assessment and received validation from SecurityMetrics against the PCI-DSS.)Moreover, as noted below, we will only permit our employees and third party service providers to access your Personal Information on a “need-to-know” basis and only after they have entered into an agreement under which they are bound to comply with applicable legislation (including privacy legislation), this Policy and related policy and procedures.We take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account on the Website. However, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username, password and any other account information. Users should not disclose their username or password.6. Who will have access to the Personal Information that you provide?
Your Personal Information will also be accessible to our employees and third party service providers on a “need-to-know” basis (i.e. where the employee or service provider requires such information to assist us with a Purpose). Examples of our third party service providers that will have access to your Personal Information include Moneris (which company processes online payments) and companies that store our data for us or provide us with data processing services. However, prior to gaining access to your Personal Information, we require all of our employees and third party service providers to enter into agreements with us under which they are bound to abide by applicable law (including privacy laws), this Privacy Policy and our other related policies and procedures.7. To whom do we disclose Personal Information that you provide?We will only disclose your Personal Information where we are permitted by applicable law to do so. We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we may disclose your Personal Information, at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure. For example, we may disclose your Personal Information to:the CCPA, for the purpose of confirming your eligibility for membership in and verifying your enrollment (including your enrollment status) with CCPA;the CCRF, in connection with potential or actual donations made to the CCRF;provincial chiropractic associations in Canada in order to reconcile membership information/status (e.g. full-time, part-time); andsuch other persons for which you provide your consent.In the event that we are required by applicable law to disclose your Personal Information without your consent, we will aim to disclose only the specific information that is required in the circumstances and, if possible, inform you about the disclosure.8. When and how do we obtain your consent to collect, use and disclose Personal Information?We generally obtain your consent prior to collecting, and in any case, prior to using or disclosing any Personal Information you provide to us for any purpose. The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations you might have in the circumstances. You may provide your consent to us either orally, electronically or in writing.
We also require users who are submitting Personal Information to the Website that is about another individual, to only do so if they have the consent of that individual (or their substitute decision-maker, if applicable).9. Cookies(a) Cookies – Generally
