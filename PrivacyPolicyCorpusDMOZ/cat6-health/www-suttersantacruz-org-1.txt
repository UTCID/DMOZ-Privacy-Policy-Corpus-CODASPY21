Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center Snapshot
Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center (SMSC) is unlike any other hospital you may
know. We offer state-of-the-art maternity and medical/surgical services, combining
patient-centered care and family convenience with the safety and security of a licensed
and accredited acute care hospital.
The hospital was designed and built to help you feel as comfortable as possible.
With 28 licensed beds, SMSC provides you with personal attention when you want it
and quiet time when you need it. Wide hallways, soft hues, balconies and expansive
windows promote wellness and healing.
Both doctors and midwives staff our maternity services, which means you have a
choice in your obstetrical care. We have six operating rooms, three procedure
suites, 12 birthing suites and 16 medical/surgical patient suites. Opened in 1996,
SMCS is fully accredited by The Joint Commission and is a certified Baby-Friendly
Hospital.
