We are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and security of your personal information. We take this responsibility seriously. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how we collect and safeguard your information. By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information in the following ways.
I. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of (1) personally identifiable information, as defined by numerous statutes in the United States(such statutes, the “PII Laws”), (2) information protected by the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), (3) personal information and private information, as defined by the New York Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (the “SHIELD Act”); (4) protected health information (“PHI”), as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), (5) personal data, as defined by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and (6) personal information, as defined by Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (“PIPEDA”, and collectively with the PII Laws, CCPA, CalOPPA, the SHIELD Act, HIPAA, and GDPR, the “Privacy Laws”) (collectively, “Personal Information”), which we gather when you access, view, complete, or use any of the Services or any webpage that hosts an App. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
II. What Information Does Global Guardian Collect?
Global Guardian does not collect Personal Information indiscriminately. We limit the type of Personal Information and the amount of Personal Information to what is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. With that in mind, we collect the following types of information from you:
A. Information You Provide to Us:
We may collect Personal Information from you when (i) you contact us with questions or concerns, and (ii) you use, interact with, respond to, or answer questions from any of the Services. The information we collect depends on your needs and, if your employer has retained us to provide the Services to you, your employer’s needs. Examples of Personal Information we may collect include the following:
your name;
personal contact information, including phone number and/or email address;
business contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and email address;
travel information;
health information;
racial or ethnic demographic information;
medical history;
family member contact information;
passport information;
employment information;
financial institution and account information;
Voice recordings when you contact us via phone, Skype, etc.;
user name or e-mail address in combination with a password or security question that would permit access to the Services; and
the contents of any communications.
You can choose not to provide us with some or all of this information, although that may affect our ability to provide the Services to you.
B. Information Collected Automatically:
When you use a Service, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, including, but not limited to, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, cookies, and Global Positioning System (GPS) location data. These are described in more detail below:
IP Addresses. Some Apps use IP addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your internet service provider to access the internet. In most consumer cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the internet), and not static (unique to a particular user's computer).
Cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer, smartphone or other device by your web browser. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, and to provide information to the owners of the site. We may collect the following information via cookies: information related to your use of any webpage that hosts an App (including your password, the links you click on, your movement around the site, the pages you visit, the number of times you open a page, information you consult, the website from which you arrived, your language, your access times, and other tracking of online behavior); your IP address; your device; your unique device identifier; your operating system; and your browser type. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to refuse some or all cookies, or to delete existing cookies from your device. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services’ features. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
GPS Location Data and Other App Data. When a user downloads one of the Apps onto his or her smartphone, Global Guardian uses the App to obtain GPS location data passively from the user’s smartphone.
Video Recordings and Security Alarm Information. In the event that we install security cameras and/or alarms in or around your home or office, we will collect information automatically from those devices. This information may include (1) video footage of you and other people in or around your home, and (2) the detection of one or more visitors or intruders.
C. E-mail and Other Communications:
We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of Global Guardian or our clients, or communicate with you about the Services. When we do this, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any of our emails or by contacting us at:
Attn: Data Protection OfficerGlobal Guardian LLC8280 Greensboro Drive, Suite 750McLean, VA 22102(703) 566-9463privacy@globalguardian.com
Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.D. Personal Information from Other Sources

For individuals and Personal Information Subject to the GDPR: In addition to relying on informed consent, Global Guardian reserves the right to process your Personal Information:
(1) As a processor, pursuant to the written authorization of a controller, i.e., your employer, as a client. Consistent with the GDPR, the controller determines the purposes and means of processing your Personal Information. As a processor, Global Guardian relies on the controller to obtain the necessary legal basis from each data subject before collecting and processing Personal Information. In the event that the controller does not have a legal basis to collect and process your Personal Information, the controller will be liable for all damages arising due to that deficiency.

(3) In order to pursue our legitimate business interests in assisting clients to protect their employees while traveling and in other defined situations.
(4) In order to perform a contract to which you are a party. Where the processing is based on a contractual requirement, your failure to provide the relevant Personal Information may result in Global Guardian being unable to assist with the completion of the contract. For example, if you do not provide your Personal Information, Global Guardian may not be able to provide medical or evacuation services while you travel.
Any one or more of these bases are the legal basis for our collection and use of your Personal Information, depending on (x) the Services Global Guardian provides to you, and (y) your relationship with Global Guardian.

D. Do Not Track
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities, over time and across different websites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. Setting or releasing your Do Not Track signal may affect how the Services operate. For clarity, this is just our Do Not Track Policy. Global Guardian does not make any promises about how third parties react when you set Do Not Track signals on your browser. In addition, the Do Not Track signal does not impact the use of information collected prior to such request.
