Retinal Detachment
Retinal Detachment
Retinal detachment occurs when the retina of the eye is pulled away from the underlying tissue to which it is attached. A retinal detachment is a medical emergency that can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated.

In most cases, the detachment is a slowly progressing issue which must be treated once symptoms are realized. In some cases, a detachment occurs due to a trauma that causes a tear in the retina, allowing fluid to enter the vitreous and pull on the retinal tissue.
What Causes a Retinal Detachment?
Retinal detachment can be a complication of cataract surgery. A severe inflammation may alter the position of the retinal tissue and begin the detachment process. Other causes of a retinal detachment may be as follows:
Nearsightedness
A retinal tear
Family history of retinal detachment
Glaucoma
Cataract surgery
Trauma
Existing eye condition
Symptoms of a Retinal Detachment
Symptoms of retinal detachment may progress slowly or rapidly, but both should be reported to a medical doctor as soon as possible so as to minimize the risk of vision loss. Some of the symptoms of a retinal detachment include:
A sudden decrease in visual acuity
Bright flashes in the periphery
An unnatural “curving” of straight lines
Loss of central vision
A dense shadow throughout the visual field
A sudden increase in the amount of “floaters” in vision
The patient should be taken to an emergency room as quickly as possible.
How is a Detached Retina Diagnosed?
Diagnosis of a retinal detachment is made after a thorough medical eye examination and the performance of the following diagnostic tests:
Dilated eye examination
Ultrasound of the eye
Fundus photography of the retina
Visual acuity test
Slit-lamp examination
Electroretinogram
Fluorescein angiography
Ophthalmoscopy
Treatment of a Retinal Detachment in Cincinnati
A retinal detachment may be treated in many ways, which may include one or both of the following:
Cryotherapy
Laser photocoagulation
Pneumatic retinopexy
Scleral buckle
Vitrectomy
Most surgeries to repair a retinal detachment are successful. In some cases, a second procedure will need to be performed. After a successful procedure, vision will take time to improve but may not return to previous levels of acuity.
