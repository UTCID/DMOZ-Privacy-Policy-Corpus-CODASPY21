to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the
Service for a specific time period (together or separately “Purchase”).

Purchase fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such
pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App and/or by

access to the Service.

to the payment card that you submit.

renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial

The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior
subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing,
unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal.

procedures disclosed to you for the particular subscription. We will not

(and may do so without notice).
6.7. Subscriptions purchased via an App Store are subject to such App
Store's refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds. You will have
to contact an App Store support.
6.8. You agree that the Purchase is final, that Company will not refund
any transaction once it has been made and that the Purchase cannot be canceled.
When you make the Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that all Purchases
are non-refundable or exchangeable. Since the Service is of a digital nature,

THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS
ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE APP, CONTENT OR SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE
AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO THE COMPANY FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE.

12. MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
12.1. PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR
RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU
MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING
CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO
COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY
NOT EXIST.
12.2. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR
MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY
FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
12.3. YOU AND THE COMPANY, AND EACH OF ITS RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE
PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS,
AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO
SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, UNLESS YOU ARE
LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION
FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
12.4. Arbitration is more informal way to settle disputes than a lawsuit in
court. A neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury is used in
arbitration, which allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is
subject to very limited review by courts. The same damages and relief that
a court can award can be awarded by arbitrators. Please see more
information about arbitration at http://www.adr.org.
12.5. A party which intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
other a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a "Notice") by an
international courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in the absence of a
mailing address provided by you to us, via any other method available to
us, including via e-mail. The Notice to the Company must be addressed to:
Florinis 7, Greg Tower, 2nd floor, 1065, Nicosia, Cyprus (as
applicable, the "Arbitration Notice Address"). The Notice shall (i)
describe the basis and nature of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set the
specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If you and the Company do not reach
an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is
received, then you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding as set
forth below or file an individual claim in small claims court.
12.6. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL EXCLUSIVELY
ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION
RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE
"Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THESE TERMS.
12.7. If you commence arbitration against us, you are required to provide a
second Notice to the Company at the Arbitration Notice Address within seven
(7) days of arbitration commencement. The Rules and AAA forms are available
online at http://www.adr.org. Unless your
Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in
which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee, if
you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against us,
then we will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the
filing fee upon our receipt of the second Notice at the Arbitration Notice
Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing
payment of the filing fee.
12.8. The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in English. A single,
independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of
business in Alexandria, Virginia (if you are from the United States) or in
Limassol, Republic of Cyprus (if you are not from the United States) will
be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and the Company
agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline
the arbitration process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties:
(i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on
written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party
initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any
personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the
arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
12.9. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE
THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU
AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE
PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION IS
FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION
SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.
12.10. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to
resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity,
applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and
this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and
sole authority to determine whether this arbitration clause can be enforced
against a non-party to this agreement and whether a non-party to these
Terms can enforce its provision against you or us.
12.11. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his
or her final, confidential decision within 120 days from the date the
arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an
additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause and in the interests of
justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and
confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed,
except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.
The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement
setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator
shall apply the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to its
conflicts of laws principles in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge
that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction
involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act
("FAA") will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings
pursuant to this Section 12. Any award rendered shall be final, subject to
appeal under the FAA.
12.12. The abovestated provisions of this Section 12 shall not apply to any
claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party's
copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property. For the
avoidance of doubt, you agree that, in the event the Company or a third
party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will
not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against us,
and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the
limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.
12.13. You and we agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may
have at law or in equity, any claim arising out of or related to these
Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, excluding a claim for
indemnification, must be initiated with the AAA or filed in small claims
court in Alexandria, Virginia within one (1) year after the claim accrues.
Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently and forever barred. This one
(1) year period includes the thirty (30) day pre-dispute procedure set
forth in sub-clause 12.5 above.
12.14. All claims you bring against the Company must be resolved in
accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this
Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim
contrary to this Section, the Company may recover attorneys' fees and
reimbursement of its costs, provided that the Company has notified you in
writing of the improperly filed claim, and you fail to promptly withdraw
such claim.
12.15. In the event that we make any material change to this arbitration
provision (other than a change to our Arbitration Notice Address), you may
reject any such change by sending us written notice to our Arbitration
Notice Address within thirty (30) days of the change, in which case your
Account and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and
this Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject,
will survive the termination of these Terms.
12.16. If only clause 12.9 paragraph above or the entirety of this Section
12 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will
be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action
arising out of or related to this Agreement.
12.17. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A
COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS
OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY
CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND
CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION.
12.18. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN
THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE, THE
SERVICE BY WRITING TO support@betterme.tips OR TO THE
ARBITRATION NOTICE ADDRESS. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST
SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE OPTING OUT AND CONTAINING ENOUGH DETAILS
ABOUT YOU FOR US TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS. IF
MORE THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS HAVE PASSED, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT OUT OF
THIS PROVISION AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION
AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
13. GOVERNING LAW
13.1. The laws of Cyprus, excluding its conflicts of law principles, govern
these Terms and your use of the Service.
13.2. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is
permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of:
13.2.1. the state and federal courts in the City of Alexandria, Virginia -
if you are a resident of the United States; or
13.2.2. the courts of the Republic of Cyprus - if you are not a resident of
the United States;
and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction and venue in
such courts, and waive any defense of improper venue or inconvenient forum.
14. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
14.1. No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring
upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to these Terms will
impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver
by the Company of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be
performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding
breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof
contained.
14.2. Subject to Section 12, if any provision of these Terms is found to be
invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms will remain in full force and
effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting
the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law.
14.3. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, these Terms set forth
the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding its subject
matter, and supersede all prior promises, agreements or representations,
whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.
14.4. The Company may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and
obligations under these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by
novation, and by accepting these Terms you give the Company consent to any
such assignment and transfer. You confirm that placing on the Service of a
version of these Terms indicating another person as a party to the Terms
shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of Company's rights
and obligations under the Agreement (unless otherwise is expressly
indicated).
14.5. All information communicated on the Service is considered an
electronic communication. When you communicate with us through or on the

electronically with you and that such communications, as well as notices,
disclosures, agreements, and other communications that we provide to you
electronically, are equivalent to communications in writing and shall have
the same force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by the
