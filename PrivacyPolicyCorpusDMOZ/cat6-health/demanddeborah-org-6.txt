Patient Responsibilities and Bill of Rights
Statement of Patient Responsibilities as a Patient at Deborah Heart and Lung Center
As a patient of DHLC, you should assume responsibility for the following:
Providing Information: DHLC expects that you or your family/healthcare representative will provide accurate and complete information about present and past medical illnesses, hospitalizations, medications, “advance directives,” and other matters relating to your health history in order to receive effective medical treatment. You or family/healthcare representative must report perceived risks in their care and unexpected changes in your condition. You and your family/healthcare representative can help the hospital understand their environment by providing feedback about service needs and expectations.
Asking Questions: DHLC expects that you and your family/healthcare representative will ask questions if you/they do not understand the patient’s care, treatment, and service of what they are expected to do.
Following Instructions: You and your family/healthcare representative must follow the care, treatment, and service plan developed. You or your family/healthcare representative should express any concerns about your ability to follow the proposed care plan or course of care, treatment, and services. The hospital makes every effort to adapt the plan to the specific needs and limitations of the patients. When such adaptations to the care, treatment, and service plan are not recommended, patients and their families are informed of the consequences of the care, treatment, and service alternatives and not following the proposed course.
Accepting Consequences: Patients and their families are responsible for the outcomes if they do not follow the care, treatment and service plan.
Following Rules and Regulations: Patients and their families must follow these hospital rules and regulations:
DHLC expects you to be considerate of other patients and hospital personnel and to assist in the control of noise and visitors in your room, and to observe the smoking policy. You are also expected to be respectful of the property of other persons and the property of this hospital.
Authorized members of your family or designated/legal representative are expected to be available to DHLC personnel for review of your treatment in the event you are unable to properly communicate with your caregivers.
It is expected that you will not take drugs which have not been prescribed by your attending physicians and administered by hospital staff; and that you will not complicate or endanger the healing process by consuming alcoholic beverages or toxic substances during your hospital stay.
As a patient at this hospital, we ask that you:
Talk to your doctor or nurse about what to expect regarding pain and pain management.
Discuss pain relief options with your doctors and nurses to develop a pain management plan.
Ask for pain relief when pain first begins.
Help your doctor or nurse assess your pain.
Tell you doctor or nurse if your pain is not relieved.
Tell your doctor or nurse about any worries you have about taking pain medication.
Notice of Your Patient Bill of Rights as a Patient at Deborah Heart and Lung Center
Whether you are in this hospital for one week or one hour, you should be aware of your rights as a patient, and what you can and should expect from this hospital in regard to communication, costs, privacy, legal rights and other issues. Because we respect you as a human being and as an individual, we created this document to explain to you the “patient rights” to which you are entitled under Federal and State law and regulations, and Hospital policy.
