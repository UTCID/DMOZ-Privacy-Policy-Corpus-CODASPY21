Non-discrimination policy
Download the Dosher Non-discrimination policy.
Dosher Memorial Hospital does not discriminate with regard to patient admissions, room assignment, patient services, or employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion, disability or age. If assistance or communication aids for impaired hearing, vision, speech, or manual skills are needed, Dosher will make reasonable accommodations.
Purpose:
To define the organization's policy regarding nondiscrimination.
Standard: In furtherance of our nation's commitment to end discrimination, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Regulations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issues pursuant to the Acts, Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 80, 84, and 91, and all other nondiscriminatory acts protecting the rights of the disabled and other individuals or groups, Dosher has established the following policy.
Communication of policy:
Dosher's notice of nondiscrimination is communicated to all participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons via multiple methods, including but not limited to the following: The notice is placed public areas, is posted in public registration areas, and is posted on the Dosher's web site.
Communication with sensory or speech impaired individuals: Dosher assures that all individuals are able to receive effective notices, including nondiscrimination and notices concerning benefits or services or information concerning waivers of rights or consent to treatment, regardless of their disability. (See Special Communication Needs Policy #RI.01.01.03)
Complaint process:
Dosher has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations (45 C.F.R. Part 84), implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified disabled individual...shall solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance...". The President/CEO, 924 N. Howe St., Phone (910) 457-3800, has been designated to coordinate the efforts of Dosher to comply with the regulations. The hospital Corporate Compliance Officer serves as the Section 504 Coordinator.
1. A complaint should be in writing, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the discriminatory act.
2. A complaint should be filed in the office of the Corporate Compliance Officer within 30 days after the person filing the complaint becomes aware of the alleged discriminatory act.
3. The President/CEO, or designee, will investigate the complaint. The investigation will be informal but thorough, affording all interested persons and their representatives an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to the complaint.
4. The President/CEO shall issue a written decision determining the validity of the complaint no later than 30 days after its filing.
5. The Corporate Compliance Officer shall maintain the files and records relating to all complaints filed. The Corporate Compliance Officer may assist persons with the preparations and filing of complaints, and advise the Chief Executive Officer concerning their resolution.
6. These rules shall be liberally construed to protect the substantial rights of interested persons to meeting appropriate due process standards and assure Dosher's compliance with Section 504 and the regulations.
