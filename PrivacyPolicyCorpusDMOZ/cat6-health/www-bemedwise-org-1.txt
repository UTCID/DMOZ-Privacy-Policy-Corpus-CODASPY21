Privacy Policy

purposes. You may always “opt out,” either now or at any time in the

off the “unsubscribe” feature on emailings, or by emailing BeMedWise
with any questions at info@BeMedWise.org. You may also email us to review
any personal information collected to request corrections. We will endeavor to
respond to your email within two business days upon receiving it.

administrator and IT staff have access to this information.
