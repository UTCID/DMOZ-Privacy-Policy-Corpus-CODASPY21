Dermatology & Autoimmune Skin Disease
When the immune system overreacts and attacks skin tissue, it’s called autoimmune skin disease. Sometimes an autoimmune condition involves only skin cells. More often, an autoimmune disease will affect more than one part of your body.
At the Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Autoimmunity Institute, you can receive exceptional care for every way an autoimmune skin condition affects your physical and mental health. Our board-certified dermatologists work closely with other specialists to treat all of your concerns.
Autoimmune skin diseases we treat
Any autoimmune diseases can affect your skin, including:
Lupus, which causes inflammation that affects multiple body systems, such as the skin, heart, and lungs
Scleroderma, which causes your body’s tissues to harden and tighten
Psoriasis, which causes rashes and scaling on your skin
Specialized care for autoimmune skin disease
At our institute, we offer highly specialized autoimmune skin care not available elsewhere in the region. You’ll benefit from the expertise of 15 kinds of autoimmune specialists. Our board-certified dermatologists are among them. These skin specialists have in-depth training to care for people with autoimmune-related skin concerns, such as rare types of rashes and lesions.
We use the latest tests to quickly pinpoint a diagnosis. Then, our physicians — who stay up-to-date with the newest treatments — help you manage the condition long term.
Our unique approach to autoimmune disease care means you can manage multiple health concerns or autoimmune conditions, in one place. This approach helps you get comprehensive care quickly. Often, you can see different specialists during a single visit.
