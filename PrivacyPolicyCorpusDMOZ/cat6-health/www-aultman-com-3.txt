Our Policies
Tobacco-free Policy
Aultman is a tobacco-free organization. This initiative demonstrates our ongoing commitment to healthy living. This policy prohibits any tobacco use on all Aultman Health Foundation properties - including parking areas, sidewalks and several privately owned roads and vehicles. The use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes is prohibited on Aultman property.
Firearms Policy
In accordance with Ohio’s Concealed Carry Law, Aultman Health Foundation prohibits any person from carrying a concealed weapon or other deadly weapon on our properties. Law enforcement officers on official business are exempt from this policy.
Flu Season Precautions
Aultman participates in a county-wide initiative to protect patients, visitors and staff during flu season. We follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations that health care workers receive annual flu vaccines or wear masks in patient care areas. When flu activity increases, visitors under age 14 are not permitted in Aultman facilities because early flu and cold symptoms are not always apparent in this age group. We will communicate about flu visitation restrictions right here on our website and with signs posted around Aultman facilities.
