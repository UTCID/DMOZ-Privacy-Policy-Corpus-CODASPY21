Description
The fields of addiction and mental health counseling continue to evolve and with resulting changes counselors are faced with increased legal scrutiny. Counseling professionals are also working in an increasingly litigious environment, thus are continually being held legally accountable for their work. Clinical supervisors are obligated to maintain a thorough grasp of ethical decision-making. The purpose of this presentation is to provide guidance to clinical supervisors on how they can ensure that their supervisees obtain a complete and integrated understanding of legal and ethical issues that pertain to their role as counselors.
Learning Objectives
Define ethical issues in supervision including dual relationships and confidentiality.
Define legal considerations in clinical supervision including vicarious liability and duty to warn.
Explore the supervisor’s role in modeling ethical behavior.
Analyze ethical obligations and ethical decision-making of the supervisor.
