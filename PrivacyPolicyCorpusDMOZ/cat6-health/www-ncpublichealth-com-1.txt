DPH Privacy Statement
The North Carolina
Division of Public Health is fully committed to protecting the privacy of
individually identifying health information (IIHI). The federal standards for
the Privacy of IIHI require that the NC DHHS Division of Public Health provide
for the safeguarding and protection of IIHI that is created, received, and
maintained in any form or medium by the Division. Information
containing patient IIHI disclosed to the Division of Public Health remains
confidential and is not public record. Identifying health information disclosed to the Division of Public
Health is used as permitted by federal and state laws and regulations to
fulfill the Division’s authorized public health functions.
The Division complies with North Carolina General Statutes and Administrative Rules mandating that all individual health information in its
possession is confidential. In addition,
the Division ensures compliance with HIPAA privacy requirements by developing
and implementing privacy policies that specify the Division’s methods for
protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The Division of Public Health continues to
comply with North Carolina
statutes, which preempt HIPAA when state statutes are more stringent than
HIPAA. The Division continues to adhere
to all federal and state laws and regulations and program-specific requirements
with respect to protecting the privacy of health information while fulfilling
its Public Health mission. In addition,
and as part of its ongoing compliance, the Division follows NC DHHS department-level HIPAA policies, procedures, and practices, as applicable.
