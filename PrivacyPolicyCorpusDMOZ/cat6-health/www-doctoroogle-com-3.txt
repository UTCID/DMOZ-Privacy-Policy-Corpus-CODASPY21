PRIVACY POLICY
Last Modified Nov 23, 2017.
Introduction
DR.Oogle ("us," "we," or "DR.Oogle") is committed to respecting the
privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the
DR.Oogle website, located at https://www.doctor-oogle.com and the
associated services we provide (the “Services”). We created this Privacy
Policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and use the
Services, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices
and the protection of privacy.
This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services, and not to any
other websites or services that you may be able to access from the
Services, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use
practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. If
you do not agree with the practices explained in this Privacy Policy, you
should not use our Services. By using our Services, you agree to accept the
practices and terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the
Terms of Service located at
https://www.doctor-oogle.com/legal_terms/.
Types of Information Collected
Traffic Data
We may automatically track and collect the following categories of
information when you use our Services: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain
servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Services; (4) types of web
browsers used to access the Services; (5) other information associated with
the interaction of your browser and the Services (collectively "Traffic
Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally
identify you.
Personal Information
In order for you to access certain areas of the Services, we may require
you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you
("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following
categories of information: (1) Contact Data, such as your e-mail address
and DR.Oogle password, and including information made available through
an SNS Account as described below; and (2) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and
income). If you
communicate with us by, for example, e-mail or letter, any information
provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.
Social Network Accounts
You can also register with our Services and create a Services account by
linking your Services acount to your account certain third-party social
services such as Facebook (each such account, an “SNS Account”), if and
when such functionality is available. If you choose to create a Service
account through one of your SNS Accounts, you may have to provide us with
your username (or userID) so that your identity can be authenticated by the
SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to link
your Services account with the SNS Account. That linking may allow us to
access certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address,
and other personally identifiable information Depending on the SNS Accounts
you choose and subject to applicable SNS privacy settings, personally
(e.g., information about your contacts on the social networking service)
may be available on and through your DR.Oogle Account. that your privacy
settings on the SNS Account permit us to access, in connection with
creating your Service account. We don’t receive or store passwords for any
of your SNS Accounts.
Public Information
The User Content that you contribute through the Service is intended for
public consumption, including your posts, photos,
comments, friend list, and any elements of your Account you make visible
(e.g., your user name). We may display this information through the
Service, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider
audience through third party sites and services.
User Choice
You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an
event, you can still access and use much of the Services; however you will
not be able to access and use those portions of the Services that require
your Personal Information.
Retention
We will retain your personally identifiable information that we process for
as long as needed to provide Services to you, and thereafter as necessary
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
agreements. We will retain non-personally-identifiable information such as
Demographic Data, Traffic Data and other usage data for as long as we
believe it to be useful in our business.
Uses of Information Collected
By DR.Oogle Itself
We use the information we collect to market, operate and improve our
Services, track the usage of the Services, provide feedback to Providers
participating in the Services, display relevant advertising, and comply
with legal obligations. Without limiting the generality of the above: (a)
we use Contact Data to send you information about DR.Oogle or our
products or services, or to contact you when necessary;
and (b) we may use your Demographic Data or your Traffic Data to
customize and tailor your experience on the Services, displaying
content that we think you might be interested in and according to your
preferences, and to provide relevant advertising to you.
Information Sharing
We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways
described in this Privacy Policy. We may share Demographic Data and Traffic
Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e.,
non-personally-identifiable) basis. We also share Personal Information and
Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core
services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and
security) related to our operation of the Services. Those business partners
have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and
confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and
they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to
carry out their specific business obligations to DR.Oogle. Last, we may
transfer information about you if DR.Oogle is acquired by or merged with
another company. In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify
you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
different privacy policy. Finally, we may share or release information in
the circumstances described below under “Expectations of Privacy”.
Cookies and Other Tracking Tools
Cookies
A "cookie" is an element of data that a website, when visited by a user,
sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on the
user's hard drive or memory.
We use "cookies" to customize your experience of our Services, to
improve the security of the Services, to store your password so you do
not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Services, and to
compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that
we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
At your option, expense and responsibility, you may block our cookies or
delete our cookies from your hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, you
may not have access to the entire set of features of the Services.
Other Analytics
We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better
understanding our site visitors. Presently, the only third-party analytics
service provider we use is Google Analytics. For Google’s privacy practices
see
this.
To opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics, see
this.
Do Not Track
We use only cookies as described above. We do not use cookies to collect
personally identifiable information or track users’ online activities over
time and across different web sites. For information regarding Do Not Track
mechanisms, see http://allaboutdnt.com/.
Expectations of Privacy
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your
Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties,
unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal
Information or any other information we collect about you is appropriate
to: (a) comply with the law, or a law enforcement agency request, subpoena,
court order or other such request by a legal authority; (b) protect the
rights, property or personal safety of DR.Oogle or anyone else; (c)
enforce our Terms and policies, to otherwise establish or exercise our
rights, or defend against legal claims; (d) investigate, prevent and take
action regarding fraud or misuse of the Service or (d) respond to claims
that any posting or other content violates the rights of third parties.
Providers
Providers, their employees, and their agents should be particularly
aware of their obligations of patient confidentiality, including
without limitation their obligations under HIPAA, both in communicating
with DR.Oogle or other Users, posting User Content and in responding
to postings and comments.
DR.Oogle does not have and will not accept any obligations of
confidentiality with respect to any communications other than those
expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and the DR.Oogle Terms of
Service.
Public Information
Any information that you may reveal in a
posting or other online discussion or forum is intentionally open to
the public and is not in any way confidential or private. You should
think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable
information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen
and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we
are unable to control or predict.
Reasonable Efforts
Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a
secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should
guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal
Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been
disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will
use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the
disclosure (to the extent we know that information), as soon as reasonably
possible and as permitted by law.
We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and to
take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with
our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our products and
services, which are further refined before the release of the final
version. Because these products and services are still in a test phase, we
may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do
so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns. In light of the
above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our
technology and business, and the security risks associated with using the
Internet, we do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy
Policy. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, SMILINGDOCS SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO
THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
Inquiries
Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold,
or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personally identifiable
information. To request this information please contact us at the address
at the end of this Privacy Policy. If your personal information changes, or
if you no longer desire to use the Services, you may correct, update,
amend, delete/remove, or deactivate it by contacting us at the addresses at
the end of this Privacy Policy. Before we process any request, we may
request personal information to verify your identity where allowed by law.
Where permitted by local law, we may reject requests that are unreasonable
or impractical. We will respond to your request within a reasonable
time frame.
International Transfer
Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on,
computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective
as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States
and choose to provide your personally identifiable information to us, we
may transfer your personally identifiable information to the United States
and process it there.
Updates and Changes
We reserve the right, at any time and without advance notice, to add to,
change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such
change, update, or modification on the Services and without any other
notice to you. If you have established an Account for the Services, we will
attempt to inform you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that
affect your obligations to us or our obligations to you: (a) by a message
displayed at the time you log into the Services, and / or (b) by such other
means as we deem reasonably likely to reach you. If you do not agree with
any such modifications, the sole remedy is the termination of your Account.
Your continued use of the Services after receiving notice of any
modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.
If you have not established an account for the Services, any modifications
to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms
and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Services, and your
continued use of the Services after any modifications indicates acceptance
of the modified Privacy Policy. You agree to review this Privacy Policy
periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.
