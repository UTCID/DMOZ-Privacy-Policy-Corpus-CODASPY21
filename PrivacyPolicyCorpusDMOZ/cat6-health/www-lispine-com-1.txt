Practice Policy Update Regarding COVID-19 View Update
Practice Policy Update Regarding COVID-19
Dear Patients:
Our patients, employees and family are our top priority at Long Island Spine Specialists, P.C.
We ask you to not visit any of our locations if you have symptoms such as fever, sneezing, coughing and possible shortness of breath.
Please cancel your appointment and re-schedule once you are feeling better and are no longer suffering with symptoms.
Only non-symptomatic patients will be seen. No exceptions.
Accompanying family members – including children – are asked to remain in the waiting area and will not be allowed to enter the exam rooms.
During this time of high concern regarding the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) we are taking extra precautions to maintain the highest possible standards of safety and cleanliness. Please be advised that we are carefully following recommendations from both the CDC and WHO and are here to help guide you through this time if needed.
Some steps we are taking to keeping safe:
We know how important cleanliness is and always maintain the highest standards of cleanliness. To further offer you peace of mind, we have increased the frequency of the cleaning of our office.
Rest assured that hand washing is strictly followed. Hand sanitizer is available to all staff and patients.
Additionally, if you have recently traveled to a country with high rates of the coronavirus or have been on a cruise, please reschedule your visit for at least 14 days from your return date. We will gladly accommodate your needs to reschedule. At that time, a telehealth interface can be arranged if necessary.
Find up-to-date and accurate information on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and feel free to reach out with questions.
- Your team at Long Island Spine Specialists, P.C.
