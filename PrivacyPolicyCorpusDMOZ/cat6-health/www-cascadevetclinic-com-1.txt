Website Policy
This page describes information collected on this Web site.
There are two types of information collected on this Web site:
Personally Identifiable Information
In some instances, this web site collects personally identifiable information (such as email address, name, phone number, etc.) This information is only collected when volunteered by the user – for example, when completing a newsletter subscription request form or registering for a class.
Non-personally Identifiable Information
This site also collects non-personally identifiable user information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, cookies, Internet tags and navigational data (server log files). This information is used for system management and to improve the content and navigation of the site.
We do not match personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information. In other words, we do not link personal information (name, etc.) with visit information, such as pages visited or files downloaded. In effect, all such visit information is anonymous.
Use of Information
We will use the information you submit to improve this web site and to better provide news on services and related news that may be of interest to you. You will only receive an e-mail from us for information you have requested or as confirmation of information that you submitted (i.e. class registration).
Any personally identifiable information you submit to us on any survey, class or event registration, web site feedback form, or for any other form is for exclusive use by this web site or other entities that are involved in the operation or fulfillment purposes of this site. It will not be shared with any other party, except if required by law.
We do not sell, trade or rent personal information about our users.
