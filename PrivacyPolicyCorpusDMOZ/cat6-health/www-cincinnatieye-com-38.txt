BOTOX® Cosmetic for Medical Use
Botulinum toxin, sold under the brand name BOTOX® Cosmetic, is a synthetic chemical that can be used to block nerve signals for treatment of a wide range of conditions. Although most commonly known for its cosmetic applications, BOTOX Cosmetic injections are an effective treatment for many medical conditions, including muscle spasm disorders such as blepharospasm, which results in forcible closure of the eyelids.
BOTOX Cosmetic injections are administered, with no need for anesthesia, directly into the affected muscle. The injection effectively blocks nerve signals sent to the muscle to prevent it from contracting and to reduce pain.
Patients may need anywhere from 1 to 10 injections during a single treatment session in order to successfully block nerve signals. The results of treatment are often most effective during the first 2 to 6 weeks after the injection and, according to the manufacturer, will last for up to 4 months. Results can be maintained through routine follow-up injections.
If you are interested in learning more about any of our cosmetic medical treatments, call 513-569-FACE (3223) today to schedule an appointment.
