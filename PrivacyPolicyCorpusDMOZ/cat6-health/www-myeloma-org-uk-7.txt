This type of cancer can sometimes progress to myeloma.

What is solitary plasmacytoma?
A solitary plasmacytoma is a discreet, single mass of abnormal (cancerous) plasma cells which can occur in bone or in soft tissue.
Some patients diagnosed with a solitary plasmacytoma will go on to develop myeloma. In general, the risk of progression to myeloma is higher in patients with a solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) compared to those with a solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP). Patients with either type of solitary plasmacytoma are monitored regularly for signs and symptoms that may indicate progression to myeloma.
How is solitary plasmacytoma diagnosed?
A person is diagnosed with a solitary plasmacytoma through tests and investigations such as a bone marrow biopsy, an imaging scan such as an X-ray, and blood tests.
How are solitary plasmacytomas treated?
Solitary plasmacytomas are most commonly treated using radiotherapy.
