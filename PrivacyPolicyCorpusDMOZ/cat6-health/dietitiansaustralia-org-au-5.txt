Call for a New National Nutrition Policy
Call for a New National Nutrition Policy
Nourish not Neglect: Putting health on our nation’s table
Australia has not updated our National Nutrition Policy in over 26 years and as Australia’s health has deteriorated it’s time to put health on our nation’s table and call for change!
A new National Nutrition Policy would address the enormous cost and increasing prevalence of diet-related chronic disease, and recognise the contribution of nutrition to the wellbeing of individuals and our population.
For Smart Eating Week, 11-17 February 2019, DA released the report: Nourish not Neglect: Putting health on our nation’s table.
This details the social and economic costs of poor nutrition to our society and outlines the proactive steps required to make a new National Nutrition Policy a reality.
Towards a National Nutrition Policy for Australia
