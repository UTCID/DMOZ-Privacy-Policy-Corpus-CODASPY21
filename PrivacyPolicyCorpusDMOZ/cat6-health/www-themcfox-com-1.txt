Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data
contained in log files. The information in the log files is annonymous,
meaning it cannot be connected to you personally. It includes
your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service
provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to
visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time
you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our
site.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal
preferences when you visit our site. This could include only
showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login
to some of our features, such as forums.

support our site.
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies

address, or telephone number) but does include your IP address,
your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed (i.e. non-personally
identifying). This is generally used for geotargeting purposes
(showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for
example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited
(such as showing vehicle ads to someone who frequents vehicle
sites).
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on
themcfox.com, including a cookie called a DART cookie. Google’s
use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on
