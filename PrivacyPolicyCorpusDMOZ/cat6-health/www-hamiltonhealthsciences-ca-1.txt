MyChart™
MyChart™ is a free, secure online tool that gives patients easy access to their health information, any time, from anywhere. Patients can view test results and other clinical records, enter personal health information, share their records and securely message their physician or healthcare professional.
Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) is leading the deployment of MyChart™ not only at our various sites but also at dozens of other hospitals across southwest Ontario. It’s the largest regional deployment of a patient portal platform in Ontario.

Notable Features
View your clinical information
Look up selected clinical information such as allergies, medication lists, blood bank results, lab tests, radiology reports, pathology reports, genetic tests and discharge summaries. Some delays are in place due to potential sensitivity of the data, need for clinical review or quality assurance purposes prior to disclosure. For a full list of data that is available within the portal, as well as the delays, please visit https://healthrecordsonline.ca/patients.
Track your health
Track your own personal health information by entering your tests and measurements into your personal health record, including allergies, medications, conditions, blood pressure, weight, mood, immunizations and medical procedures. Enter appointments that have been scheduled in order to receive an email reminder prior to the day of your appointment.
Share your records
You may share access to your MyChart™ account with other care providers and family members in the case of an emergency or to help facilitate care anywhere you go.
Upload your results
Upload electronic copies of your test results from specialist clinics so that you have them available for reference whenever you need them.
Securely access your account 24/7
Log into MyChart.ca at home or on your mobile device, anywhere in the world, to get real-time access to your health records.
Securely message other users
Once you choose to share your record with other care providers or family members, and they agree to gain access to your record, you can securely message those users within your MyChart™ account.
When will MyChart™ be available to HHS patients?
MyChart is currently available to all patients at Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster Children’s Hospital, and Ron Joyce Children’s Health Centre. Please note only patients 12 years of age and older can register for MyChart. Wider enrollment will be extended to other hospital sites in early 2020.
