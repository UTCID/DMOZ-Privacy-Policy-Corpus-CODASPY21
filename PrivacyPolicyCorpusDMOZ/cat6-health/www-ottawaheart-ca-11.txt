Our Accessibility Plan
The Government of Ontario has set a goal of establishing a fully accessible province within 20 years. The goal requires the provincial government to work with the public and private sectors and the disabled community to jointly develop standards to be achieved in stages of 5 years or less. The objective is to “improve opportunities for people with disabilities and to provide for their involvement in the identification, removal and prevention of barriers to their full participation in the life of the province.”
This multi-year plan covers the period of 2018 - 2022. It is a joint planning exercise with The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) and the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI).
