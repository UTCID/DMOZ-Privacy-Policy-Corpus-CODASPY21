Compliments and Complaints
Feedback is vital to make sure we are providing a quality service to carers.
Our teams welcome your comments and suggestions and take every opportunity to continuously improve our standards across all services for carers.
If you are a carer or colleague, please do pass on any feedback you wish us to take into account and feel free to raise any concern or complaint.
You will be assured of a carer-friendly response.
We consider it very important that carers and others can be part of any process to resolve difficulties. Our staff will do their best to ensure you are regularly updated on progress of any investigation and are informed of the outcome within a realistic timescale.

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
Carers Support West Sussex values diversity and recognise that people with different backgrounds, skills, attitudes and experiences enrich the communities we serve contributing fresh ideas, valuable insights and new perceptions to the way our organisation works either as carers, staff or partners.
Our aim is to be an inclusive organisation that promotes a culture that values differences where diversity is fully embraced and respected.
We are committed to challenging all forms of discrimination or disadvantage and aim to ensure that no individual or group is directly or indirectly discriminated against for any reason with regard to employment or access to services.
Positive about Disabled People
Carers Support have gained Positive About Disabled People accreditation and have been given permission by Jobcentre Plus to use the Two Ticks symbol, having made the following
5 commitments:
to interview all disabled applicants who meet the minimum criteria for a job vacancy and to consider them on their abilities
to discuss with disabled employees, at any time but at least once a year, what you can both do to make sure they can develop and use their abilities
to make every effort when employees become disabled to make sure they stay in employment
to take action to ensure that all employees develop the appropriate level of disability awareness needed to make these commitments work
to review these commitments every year and assess what has been achieved, plan ways to improve on them and let employees and Job Centre Plus know about progress and future plans
