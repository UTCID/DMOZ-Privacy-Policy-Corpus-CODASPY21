For those platforms that use a single login (e.g. Twitter), the login information will be shared with the client staff member’s supervisor.

AAEM staff shall monitor the posts regularly to ensure that all material is in compliance with all applicable social media policies.
AAEM staff who have been designated to represent AAEM shall manage the addition of content to AAEM social media accounts. AAEM members should notify the staff if inappropriate content is posted. Only AAEM staff should manage the removal of content from AAEM accounts.
AAEM staff and AAEM/RSA members who have been designated to represent AAEM/RSA shall manage the addition of content to AAEM/RSA social media accounts. AAEM/RSA members should notify the staff if inappropriate content is posted. Only AAEM staff should manage the removal of content from AAEM/RSA accounts.

Account Monitoring Recommendations
An essential part of managing a presence on a social media platform is monitoring that presence to ensure that all content posted is appropriate. These policies address circumstance under which content may be removed.
These policies are not intended to represent the full scope of content that should be removed.
AAEM reserves the right to monitor the platform for inappropriate posts, edit, restrict or remove content that is believed to be factually incorrect, in violation of any applicable social media policy or in violation of any applicable law.
Any content or comments posted to AAEM’s profiles or posts on a social media platform containing any of the following items shall be removed:
Profane language or content;
Content that promotes, fosters or perpetuates discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, age, religion, gender, marital status or with regard to national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation;
Sexual content or links to sexual content;
Solicitations of commerce that is not approved by AAEM;
Content that encourages restraint of trade or other violations of antitrust;
Content that is not in line with the AAEM mission or the organization’s values;
Content that is political in nature, but not sanctioned by the organization as a whole;
Conduct or encouragement of illegal activity.
Any communications shared through social media must be consistent in tone, style, and message content. All posts shall adhere to the AAEM brand guidelines.
AAEM staff shall follow all applicable social media policies when monitoring content on social media accounts.
Social Media Etiquette
Whether using social media personally or on behalf of AAEM, it is important to be mindful of the way comments can be construed. These guidelines are designed to capture some of the more common practices when it comes to social media etiquette.
General Recommendations
Always express ideas and opinions in a respectful manner.
All communications should be in good taste;
Be sensitive when linking to outside content as redirecting to another site may imply endorsement of its content;
Be cautious not to denigrate or insult others.
Be transparent.
When posting content to a social media site without official approval from AAEM to act as a spokesperson, add a disclaimer to the effect of: "The opinions and positions expressed are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of AAEM."
Only individuals authorized by AAEM may use the AAEM logo in communications.
Protect confidential information and relationships. Online postings and conversations are not private; therefore,
Avoid identifying and discussing others, including employees, members, exhibitors and supporters, Posters should obtain permission prior to posting;
Obtain permission before posting pictures of others, logos or other copyrighted information;
Never discuss proprietary information, or anything considered confidential;
Express your points in a clear, logical way. Given the nature of social media, a single comment can become a dialogue. When confronted with a difference of opinion, be careful to stay calm, correcting mistakes when warranted. Only ignore comments when it is clear that someone isn't interested in interacting with you and only wants to be inflammatory.
Attempt to add value. The posted content adds value if it improves the knowledge or skills of site users if it builds a sense of community or if it helps to promote AAEM’s values.
Privacy
Be careful with personal information; do not post any content that contains personal health information, including but not limited to patient images.
Be familiar with the privacy settings on the social media platform, and make use of them to protect your information and content.
Never post something that would be offensive, hurtful, damaging or inappropriate if it were stated publicly.
AAEM staff and members are prohibited from collecting or storing, or attempting to collect or store, personal data about third parties without their knowledge or consent.
Posting Guidelines
Posts should be used to:
Inform users of deadlines, member benefits, changes in policy, or other information that is necessary to their membership.
Be an educational resource.
Promote upcoming AAEM events.
Tone of posts:
Can be relatively informal to promote engagement, but still professional.
Shall appear to come from AAEM as an organization rather than an individual.
Shall use we/AAEM rather than I.
Refrain from posting:
Medical advice or medical commentary.
Any material (by uploading, posting, email or otherwise) that contains software viruses, worms, disabling code, or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.
Any product or service endorsements or any content that may be construed as political lobbying, solicitations or contributions, or positions on issues on any legislation or law that AAEM has not decided as an entire organization to support.
