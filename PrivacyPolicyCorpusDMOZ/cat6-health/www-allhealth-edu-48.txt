Cardiology & Autoimmune Heart Disease
At the Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Autoimmunity Institute, we bring together 15 types of autoimmune specialists to help you easily manage multiple autoimmune conditions. Our team includes cardiologists who are passionate about providing outstanding care for autoimmune conditions that affect the heart, such as lupus and scleroderma.
Autoimmune heart diseases we treat
When the body’s immune system targets the heart, it can damage it in different ways. Heart diseases that are sometimes caused by an immune response include:
Rheumatic heart disease: When inflammation called rheumatic fever causes damage to the heart valves
Pericarditis: When there is inflammation in the sac that surrounds the heart
Myocarditis: When there is inflammation in the heart muscle
Endocarditis: When there is inflammation in the heart’s inner walls and valves
Coronary artery disease: Where there are narrowed blood vessels due to fatty deposits, which restrict blood flow
Specialized care for autoimmune heart disease
At our institute, our cardiologists have specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of complex autoimmune heart diseases. They use comprehensive blood and imaging tests to evaluate your heart’s function. You can receive all of these tests at West Penn Hospital.
We know it can be overwhelming to manage every way an autoimmune disease can affect your health. That’s why our specialists sit down with you to explain your diagnosis and all your treatment options.
