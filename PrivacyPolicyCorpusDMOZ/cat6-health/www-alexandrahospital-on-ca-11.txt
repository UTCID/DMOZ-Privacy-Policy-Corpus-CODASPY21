It is your obligation and responsibility to make yourself aware of hospital policies. Policies that exist at a corporate or board level reflect the overall organization and affect everyone in the facility. Policies are also in place for specific departments or units.Procedures are plans for action that give directions for daily operations. They are a natural outgrowth of policies, supplying the "how to" for the rule. Procedures are used to achieve uniformity of practice and facilitate training.CORPORATEPATIENT CAREConfidentiality and Privacy EthicsHarassment & DiscriminationHuman Resources (if you are hiring and/or managing staff)Media RelationsAdmitting and Patient Registration Advanced Directives Bed Management Consent to Treatment Consent to Operation or Procedure Death and Coroner's Cases Emergency Measures Health Records (Dictation and Transcription)  Infection Control Latex Allergy Medical Directives Pharmacy Formulary
