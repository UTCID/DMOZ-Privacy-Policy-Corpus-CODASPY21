Missed Appointment Policy
Our goal is to provide quality individualized medical care in a timely manner. No-shows, late shows and cancellations inconvenience those individuals who need access to veterinary care. We would like to remind you of our policy regarding missed appointments. A missed appointment is when you fail to show up for an appointment without a phone call, or cancel without at least 24-hour notice.A veterinary / client relationship is built on mutual trust and respect. As such, we strive to be on time for your scheduled appointments, and ask that you give us the courtesy of a call when you are unable to keep your appointment.  As a courtesy, we provide reminder calls the day before your appointment.  Below, our missed appointment policies are outlined.
Cancellation of an appointmentIn order to be respectful of the medical needs of other patients, please be courteous and call our office promptly if you are unable to make your scheduled appointment time.  This time will be reallocated to someone who is need of treatmentHow to cancel your appointmentTo cancel your appointment, please call 518-587-4676. If you do not reach the Front Staff, you may leave a detailed message on our voicemail. We will gladly call you  to reschedule your pets appointment.
Late CancellationsA cancellation is considered to be late when the appointment is cancelled without a 24 hour advance notice.No Show PolicyA "no-show" appointment is a client who misses an appointment without cancelling it. Failure to be present at the time of a scheduled appointment is recorded in records. This includes arriving 15 minutes after your scheduled appointment.We certainly understand every one has 'one of those days' and will gladly reschedule your appointment. The first time there is a "no-show" or late cancellation there will be no charge to the client. A second occurrence will result in a charge of missed exam fee. A 3rd occurrence will result in a fee for the missed appointment and will only be able to Pre-Pay for future exams in full and forfeit the deposit if appointment is missed. Abuse of this policy and the client may be discharged from the practice.
Surgery Appointment No Show PolicyA surgery "no-show" is a client who misses a surgery appointment without providing 24 hours notice of cancellation. The first time this occurs we will call to offer to reschedule the appointment, but our missed fee of $100 will be waived.  At the second missed surgical appointment, we will call to reschedule and you will be charged a missed appointment fee of $100.  If a third incident occurs, you will be charged a missed fee of $100 and may be discharged from the practice.
