Testimonials ..."Hi Jo, I just wanted to say thank you for my reflexology. I think it really helped. I had a little girl on Thursday afternoon and although I went to hospital, I was relaxed and think this helped during my labour!" Niki from Winnersh"I must admit I was slightly sceptical about Reflexology as I’d been suffering with digestion problems for over 20 years and had a hormonal imbalance too that doctors had been unable to help me with. But it was clear from my very first treatment that it was having an effect and after 4 treatments, my digestion has improved considerably and I’ve had no more hormonal acne, which I’m over the moon about. Jo always made me feel relaxed and at ease and I would definitely recommend her." Julia... EarleyPlease see my Tesimonials
