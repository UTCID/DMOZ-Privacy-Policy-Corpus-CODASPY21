Share your story
We’re always looking for people to share their experience of bowel cancer and Bowel Cancer UK. Whether you have personal experience yourself or through a family member or friend with the disease, we use stories in the media, on our website, on social media and in our materials.
By raising awareness of what we do and of bowel cancer, we can reach more people and save more lives. Personal stories highlight the experience of people affected by bowel cancer, raise awareness of the signs and symptoms and can encourage and inspire other people affected.
Please complete the form below to share your story with us.
