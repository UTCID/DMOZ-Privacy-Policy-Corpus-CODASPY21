NURSING NETWORK'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH USERS
You acknowledge that
Nursing Network
may terminate your account (which is separate from a Network Creator's right to terminate your account), and
remove your
Nursing Network
ID, Content and Network Member Data, as well as disable your access to any and all Social Network / Group Sites
and the
Nursing Network
Platform, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If you are a Network Member, you acknowledge that
nothing in any agreement (or related policies) you may be subject to with any Network Creator or other party
will alter, impair, supersede, amend or otherwise affect in any way any terms of this Agreement, any Guidelines
or
Nursing Network's
Privacy Policy.
17. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT/DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT COMPLIANCE
It is
Nursing Network's
policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act
("DMCA").
For more information, please go to
Nursing Network's
DMCA Notification Guidelines.
Nursing Network
may remove any allegedly infringing Network Code or Content without any liability to you.
Nursing Network
will promptly terminate without notice any Member's (including, for clarity, Network Member's or
Network Creator's) access to the
Nursing Network
Platform, including access to any Social Network / Group Site, in appropriate circumstances where the Member
is a "repeat infringer" of copyrights. Generally,
Nursing Network
will consider a Member a repeat infringer if it has received more than two third-party notices of alleged
infringement concerning Network Content or Network Code posted by that Member anywhere on the
Nursing Network
Platform.
Nursing Network,
however, reserves the right to identify and terminate Members under any circumstances it deems appropriate,
including after only a single instance of allegedly infringing behavior by that Member. Additionally, if a
Network Creator continues to allow its Network Member's to post Content that is subject to notices of alleged
copyright infringement, the Network may (at
Nursing Network's
sole discretion) be disabled.
Additionally, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to: promptly (and in any event in no more than 24 hours)
address (including removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content for valid DMCA take down
notices) any copyright owner's written notice
(including any notices forwarded to you by
Nursing Network)
that specified Content or Network Code posted on Your Social Network / Group Site infringes that third-party's
rights (including copyrights), provided that the notice substantially complies with the requirements in the
DMCA. If you receive a counter-notice from the applicable Member that substantially complies with the
requirements of the DMCA instructing you to replace the allegedly infringing Content or Network Code, you agree
to replace or cease disabling access to the Content or Network Code not less than ten (10) and no more than
fourteen (14) days after receiving the counter notice, provided that the complaining party has not notified you
that it has filed an action against the Member regarding the alleged infringement. You also agree to forward a
copy of the counter notice to
Nursing Network.
Nursing Network
strongly recommends that you consult with a legal professional to confirm your obligations under the DMCA.
Nursing Network
is not providing legal advice to you and nothing in this Agreement is legal advice nor guarantees your
compliance with applicable law or regulation. You are solely responsible and liable for complying with all
applicable laws, including copyright and privacy laws in connection with Your Social Network.
18. NETWORK MEMBER DATA
Through our
Nursing Network
Member Services,
Nursing Network

Nursing Network
Member Data from Your Network Members and general information about a User's use of Your Social Network /
Group Site(s). If you are a Network Creator, Moderator or Administrator, you agree that your access to this
Nursing Network
Member Data (including the email addresses provided by Network Members during the
Nursing Network
ID registration / signup process) as part of the management controls of Your Social Network / Group Site(s)
is subject to the
Nursing Network
Privacy Policy. In addition, subject to this Agreement, you may collect Network Member Data from Your Social
Network / Group Site Members; if you do so, you hereby agree that such Network Member Data shall not be used
in a manner inconsistent with, or that causes
Nursing Network
to violate
Nursing Network's
Privacy Policy.
Member privacy is important to us. Therefore, if you are a Network Creator, Moderator or an Administrator,
you hereby agree that your use and disclosure of Network Member Data and any
Nursing Network
Member Data shall: (a) comply with all Guidelines; and (b) be reasonably protective of each Network Member's
rights and in no event shall you observe standards of privacy and confidentiality in connection with the use
and disclosure of
Nursing Network
Member Data or Network Member Data that are less stringent than the standards set forth in the
Nursing Network
Privacy Policy.
You must clearly communicate on Your Social Network / Group site that Your Social Network uses
Nursing Network
ID authentication (including, on each page on Your Social Network on which information is collected for
purposes of
Nursing Network
ID authentication) and that each of Your Network Members will be sharing the data they provide to you with
Nursing Network.
This is for clarity and to ensure Your Network Members are aware of this relationship.
Subject to this Agreement and each Network Member's rights, all Network Member Data shall be the property of
the applicable Network Creators. That being said,
Nursing Network
needs to run Your Social Network / Group Site on the
Nursing Network
Platform. To this end, as a Network Creator, you hereby grant
Nursing Network
a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicenseable, fully paid-up, royalty-free
right and license to (i) use, reproduce, store, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and
display the Network Member Data on or through the
Nursing Network
Platform and in all current and future media in which the
Nursing Network
Platform may be distributed; (ii) use and disclose the Network Member Data and related metrics in an
aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in targeting advertising in a
non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with the
Nursing Network
Platform; and (iii) use Network Member Data for other purposes permitted by the
Nursing Network
Privacy Policy.
You acknowledge that
Nursing Network
may receive requests from Users or persons authorized to act on behalf of such Users to modify or delete
personally identifiable information relating to such Users on Your Social Network / Group Site. Accordingly,
you agree that, within 24 hours of any email request by
Nursing Network,
you will: (a) delete all Network Member Data and other personally identifiable information in your possession
or control relating to a particular User as specified by
Nursing Network;
and (b) confirm such deletion in email notice to
Nursing Network.
Nursing Network
is not required to keep back-up copies of Network Member Data on the
Nursing Network
Platform once the Social Network / Group Site or Network Member Data is deleted.
Nursing Network
makes no guarantee that Network Member Data will be safely stored on the
Nursing Network
Platform. To be safe, you should independently back-up Network Member Data.
19. YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK / GROUP SITE
We want to give you as a Network Creator as much freedom to create and control the Social Network /
Group site(s) you build on the
Nursing Network
Platform as possible. You may have your own agreement(s) or policies between you and each of Your Network
Members, provided that each such agreement or policies do not supersede, amend or otherwise affect in any way
any terms of this Agreement, any Guidelines or our Privacy Policy and provided that you allow
Nursing Network
to display the
Nursing Network
Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and any Guidelines on your Social Network.
To enable a great experience for all Users on the
Nursing Network
Platform, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to ensure each Social Network / Group Site you create or
manage does not degrade the performance of the
Nursing Network
Platform. If your Social Network / Group Site(s) exceed the quotas and limitations set by
Nursing Network
(e.g., storage or bandwidth) as set forth in the
Nursing Network
Platform Policies or otherwise degrades performance of the
Nursing Network
Platform or other services in any way, we may suspend your Social Network / Group Site(s) at our sole
discretion and without notice.
You agree not to harvest any email addresses from Social Networks or the
Nursing Network
Platform for the purpose of sending email in violation of applicable law or otherwise violate the
"Acceptable Use and Conduct" provisions of this Agreement.
You also agree not to knowingly collect any information from, or develop any Social Networks / Group Site(s)
that are targeted at children under the age of 13.
You acknowledge that
Nursing Network
may terminate the account of any Member (including Your Social Network / Group Site Members) in accordance with
these Terms of Service.
Your Social Network / Group Site(S) shall not be designed or implemented in a way that, as determined by
Nursing Network
in its sole discretion, might mislead a User into believing that: (i) he or she is interacting directly with
Nursing Network
when interacting with Your Social Network / Group Site, or (ii) any of Your Social Network was created by or
are endorsed by
Nursing Network.
Because we want you to have as much freedom over your Social Network / Group Site as possible,
Nursing Network
takes no responsibility for any Content located in Your Social Network / Group Site and
Nursing Network
has no obligation to monitor such Content or Your Social Network / Group Site.
You acknowledge that
Nursing Network
also reserves the right to remove, preserve, and disclose any information or Content on any Social Network /
Group Site (including
Nursing Network
ID and Network Member Data) or account it deems necessary or appropriate to (a) satisfy any applicable law,
regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce this Agreement, including investigation of
potential violations hereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues,
(d) respond to User support requests, (e) protect the rights, property, or safety of
Nursing Network,
its Users, and the general public, or (f) investigate or defend ourselves against third-party claims or
allegations.
20. YOUR ACCOUNT

Nursing Network
ID in order to become a
Nursing Network

settlement with the debtor." And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state
