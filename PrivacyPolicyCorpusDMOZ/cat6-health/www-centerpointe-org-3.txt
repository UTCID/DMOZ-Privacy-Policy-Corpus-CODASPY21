The people we serve are overcoming seemingly overwhelming obstacles.
They lack adequate homes.
They are isolated by their co-occurring diseases of mental illness and addiction.
They often have no job, no insurance—and no hope.
It is possible for them to turn their lives around. Your involvement saves and changes lives.
“I came here with nothing. No home, no hope, no dreams, no plans, barely alive. Now I have a future, and I have myself back. Thank you!” - Chris, a CenterPointe graduate.
