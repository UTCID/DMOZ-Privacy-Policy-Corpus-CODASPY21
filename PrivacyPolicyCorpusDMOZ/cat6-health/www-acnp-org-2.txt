Printed copies of any and all agreements and/or notices in electronic form shall be admissible in any legal, investigative or regulatory proceedings.
Waiver and Severability. The failure of ACNP to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
