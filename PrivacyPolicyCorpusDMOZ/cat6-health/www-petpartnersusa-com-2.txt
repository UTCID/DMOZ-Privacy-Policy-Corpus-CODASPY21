These additional terms of use apply to your use of the VCA Skill (the “Skill”) on Amazon’s Alexa service (“Alexa”) on any Alexa-enabled device.
By using the Skill you agree to these additional terms.
You understand that the use of the Skill is voluntary.
By using the VCA Skill on Amazon’s Alexa service on any Alexa-enabled device (e.g., Amazon Echo) you can use voice commands to communicate with us regarding your Account and other features enabled by the Skill.
Your communication with VCA using Alexa constitutes an authorized communication by you.
You are solely responsible for all communications with VCA using the VCA Skill.
Please ensure that others do not interact with VCA via the VCA Skill on your behalf, and, if you do not want to be overheard, ensure that you are out of earshot when interacting with VCA via the Skill.
It is possible that your Alexa-enabled device and/or Amazon will record your interactions with the VCA Skill or with Alexa.
The VCA Skill has limited ability to respond to any free form request at this time.
IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR PET IS EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, SEEK APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY VETERINARY MEDICAL CARE IMMEDIATELY BY CALLING A VETERINARY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.
Alexa and your Alexa-enabled device were not designed or manufactured by VCA. Alexa uses software that was not designed by VCA and over which we have no control. It is possible that Alexa may not hear you properly, may misinterpret what you say, or may say something to you that is different than the information that we provided to Alexa in response to your questions.
You understand and agree that VCA is not responsible for any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the information that you receive from Alexa or by using the Skill.
In the case of any inaccuracies or discrepancies in information that you receive from Alexa or by using the Skill the information in our internal systems will prevail over any information provided through Alexa.
The Skill is provided on an “as is,” “without any warranty” and “without any liability” basis. You bear the risk of using it. VCA does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the Skill. VCA does not warrant that the functionality or operation of the Skill will be uninterrupted or free from error, that any defects in the Skill will be corrected or that the Skill or the servers that make it available are free of viruses or other harmful conditions or components. The Skill may occasionally be restricted, interrupted or discontinued due to various conditions, including without limitation Skill design, network coverage, government regulation and situations beyond VCA’s control. VCA, VCA’S AFFILIATES, AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS THEIR THIRD-PARTY AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR MERCHANTS, WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF, THAT ARISE OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, YOUR USE OF THE SKILL. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VCA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SKILL, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE REGARDING AVAILABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR ANY USE OR PURPOSE, COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY STANDARDS AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
By installing and using the Skill, you agree that Amazon may use your information to complete your request through Alexa, and you authorize VCA to share with Amazon the information we require to complete your request. When you use the Skill, the information that you communicate to Alexa is shared with Amazon, and is then sent to VCA.
VCA then sends the information which you have requested to Amazon, which is then communicated back to you with you through Alexa. Both Amazon and VCA use the internet to communicate with one another. If you do not agree that Amazon may receive and use your information, do not use the Skill. VCA’s use of your information is governed by VCA’s Privacy Policy.
We may change or discontinue the Skill or any part of it, at any time, with no notice to you and at our sole discretion.
