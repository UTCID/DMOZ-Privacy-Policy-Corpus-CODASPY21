User is solely responsible for compliance with any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right, which may apply, to any material of any nature found on the Site.
Limitation of Liability and Warranties
THE SITE AND ALL CONTENT AND MATERIALS ON THE SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. USER AGREES TO USE THE SITE SOLELY AT USER’S OWN RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR CONTENT OF ANY AND ALL MATERIAL, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES POSTED ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITE, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Provider is not liable for the conduct of other Users or third parties and the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with User.
Provider is not liable for damages of any nature including, without limitation, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of User’s use of the Site or inability to access or use the Site or out of any breach of any warranty.
Interactions with Mental Health Professionals
If you choose to interact with a mental health professional on the Site, your relationship is strictly with the mental health professional, and Provider is not involved in any way with that relationship. myTHERAPYnet.com is acting as a “virtual” landlord (leasor) who simply leases space and services to those desiring to conduct their practices at or on this site. Provider does not endorse or recommend any mental health professional on the Site. Provider advises and encourages User to check the certification and/or licensing of the mental health professional with the applicable state regulatory Board or authority.
User acknowledges that the mental health professionals on the Site are not employees or agents of Provider and Provider assumes no responsibility for any act or omission of any mental health professional. User understands and agrees that, although a mental health professional may have been accessed through the Site, Provider cannot predict or assess a mental health professional’s competence and appropriateness for User’s needs. User also understands that User takes full responsibility for the decision to access a mental health professional through the Site and to continue to interact with the mental health professional, and that the role of Provider is strictly limited to providing access to mental health professionals and their services for User’s consideration.
Counseling/therapy, whether occurring face- to-face in a therapist’s office or online, may have both benefits and risks. Risks sometimes include experiencing uncomfortable feelings such as, but not limited to, sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger and frustration. Unpleasant aspects of User’s life may be discussed, and this can cause discomfort. On the other hand, therapy can lead to a reduction in feelings of distress, can result in more effective functioning, both individually and within relationships, and can resolve or minimize specific problems.
The success of therapy depends upon a variety of factors, not the least of which is the professional relationship and the “chemistry” between User and therapist or counselor. No therapist can or should offer a guaranty of a cure for a particular problem. It sometimes will be necessary for a therapist to refer User to another therapist if he/she determines that User is not sufficiently benefiting from the therapy. User, of course, can change his or her therapist or counselor at any time and for any reason.  Testimonials on this site or the newsletters published by myTHERAPYnet.com should not be considered general to all therapists, counselors, life coaches and clients.
While online therapy, counseling or coaching offer a variety of advantages to the consumer, they also have some limitations. One of the advantages that online therapy offers is the ease of access. Clients can access therapists from the privacy of their homes or from other locations. Also, there is no need to travel to the therapist’s office, or to travel back to one’s home or office. In other words, one’s valuable time can be used efficiently. People who live in rural areas can more easily access therapy. Those who are disabled or for a variety of reasons may not want to visit a therapist’s office (e.g., privacy concerns) can interact with a therapist more easily. Since access is enhanced, those who need help may now get the help they might have otherwise missed.
On-line therapy also has its limitations. For instance, face- to- face interaction between a therapist and client allows the therapist to observe the client’s dress, demeanor, facial expressions and other nonverbal cues, which can help in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the client. In online therapy, therapists can lose the auditory and visual feedback from their clients that might otherwise cue the therapist regarding a potential miscommunication.
Provider agrees to provide a secure site where confidentiality is protected. This will be done using state-of-the-art technology. While these reasonable efforts are made to protect confidentiality, online therapy presents risks to confidentiality that are not typically present in face-to-face therapy. For instance, the possibility that others at the client’s home or other location may have access to records of client/therapist communications cannot be ignored. myTHERAPYnet.com utilizes SSL encryption for security and therapist/client communications are not stored in by the Company’s servers.
Another limitation regarding online therapy is that insurance companies or HMOs are not likely to reimburse or authorize mental health treatment delivered online. While this may change in time, User should not expect coverage for online therapy at the present time unless the health plan in question has indicated in writing that such coverage is available. It is important to understand that not all problems and conditions are suited for online therapy and that referrals may be made to other practitioners or facilities for in-person treatment when the User’s therapist deems it to be appropriate. This may occur after the initial assessment or after it becomes apparent to Therapist or User that more intensive treatment may be warranted.
The therapist should provide User with further disclosures that may be required by the law in the state in which he/she practices. Even if there exists no law requiring specific disclosures, it is important that User be informed of basic information relating to his/her therapist and to the nature of his/her practices. For instance, User’s therapist should disclose the fee to be charged, the exceptions to confidentiality that may exist, his/her availability and what to do in case of an emergency, and whether or not he/she will work with minors. The therapist may also disclose or User may request that he/she disclose, information relating to his/her education, training, experience and theoretical orientation.
With respect to exceptions to confidentiality, for instance, therapists are generally required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Some states require the reporting of suspected elder abuse or dependent adult abuse. Additionally, User’s Therapist will likely be permitted or required to break confidentiality when User is in such mental or emotional condition as to be a danger to himself or herself or to others. User should check with his/her Therapist or counselor as to the specific limitations to confidentiality that exist in their state.
