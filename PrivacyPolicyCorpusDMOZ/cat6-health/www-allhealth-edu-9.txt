Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a ballooning, weakened area in the portion of the aorta that runs through the abdomen. AAA can lead to a tear in the artery wall and can cause fatal bleeding. Slow-growing and small abdominal aortic aneurysms may not ever rupture, but fast-growing, large ones may.
Cardiovascular surgeons at Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cardiovascular Institute are leaders in using advanced diagnostic technology and therapeutic intervention to diagnose and treat abdominal aortic aneurysms.
