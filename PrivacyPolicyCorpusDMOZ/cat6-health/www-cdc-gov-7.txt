Twitter Participation Policy
While we encourage followers and interested persons and organizations to share thoughts and opinions on CDC’s social media pages, we expect that this will be done in a respectful manner.
CDC does not agree with or endorse every comment that individuals post on our pages. Our goal is to share ideas and information with as many individuals as possible and our policy is to accept the majority of comments made to our profiles.
However, the content of your tweets must relate to (topics under discussion related to) CDC (and CDC partner work). We expect that participants will treat each other with respect. We reserve the right to delete tweets and/or mute or block profiles that post tweets that do any of the following:
Introduce non-business issues;
Discuss personal issues;
Discuss religious and political beliefs;
Make personal attacks;
Use profanity, obscene or vulgar language;
Include hate speech or offensive terms targeting specific individuals or groups;
Include nudity in profile or feed images;
Conduct or request participation in surveys;
Advertise or sell products or services;
Engage in spamming or trolling;
Infringe on copyrights;
Post other comments that the CDC/NCHHSTP/OD/HCSO Social Media team deem inappropriate.
We will not answer any medical questions. Only a health care provider can answer questions about your health.
CDC does not necessarily agree with or endorse tweets from outside of CDC related to our Twitter activities. We recognize that Twitter is open 24/7 and your comments are welcome at any time.
