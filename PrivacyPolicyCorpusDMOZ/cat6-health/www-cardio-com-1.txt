It also describes your rights as they relate to your protected health information. This Notice was originally effective April 14, 2003 and was reviewed/revised in July 2013 and June 2016, and applies to all protected health information as defined by federal regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).Understanding Your Health Record/InformationEach time you visit CIS, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains your symptoms, examination and test results, diagnoses, treatment, and a plan for future care or treatment.

This includes the coordination or management of your health care with a third party that has already obtained your permission to have access to your protected health information. For example, CIS would disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to a home health agency that provides care to you. CIS will also disclose protected health information to other physicians who may be treating you. For example, your protected health information may be provided to a physician to whom you have been referred to ensure that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you.In addition, CIS may disclose your protected health information from time-to-time to another physician or health care provider (e.g., a specialist or laboratory) who, at the request of your physician, becomes involved in your care by providing assistance with your health care diagnosis or treatment.Payment: CIS will use your protected health information for payment. Your protected health information will be used, as needed, to obtain payment for your health care services.

This may include certain activities that your health insurance plan may undertake before it approves or pays for the health care services such as; making a determination of eligibility or coverage for insurance benefits, reviewing services provided to you for medical necessity, and undertaking utilization review activities. For example, obtaining approval for a hospital stay may require that your relevant protected health information be disclosed to the health plan to obtain approval for the hospital admission.Health Care Operations: CIS will use your protected health information for regular health operations. Members of the medical staff, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and others like it.

These activities include, but are not limited to, quality assessment activities, employee review activities, training of students, licensing, marketing and fundraising activities, and conducting or arranging or other business activities.For example, we may disclose your protected health information to medical or nursing school students that see patients at our office. In addition, CIS may use a sign-in sheet at the registration desk and may ask you to sign your name and indicate your physician. We may also call you by name in the waiting room when your physician is ready to see you. We may use or disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to contact you to remind you of your appointment.CIS will share your protected health information with third party "business associates" that perform various activities (e.g., billing, transcription services) for the practice. Whenever an arrangement between CIS and a business associate involves the use or disclosure of your protected health information, CIS will have a written contract that contains terms that will protect the privacy of your protected health information.CIS may use or disclose your protected health information, as necessary, to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. CIS may also use and disclose your protected health information for other marketing activities.

If this happens, CIS shall try to obtain your consent as soon as reasonably practicable after the delivery of treatment.
