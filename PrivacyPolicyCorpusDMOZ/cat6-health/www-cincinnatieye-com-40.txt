Digital Retinal Imaging
Digital retinal imaging is an advanced diagnostic tool that is used to effectively detect and diagnose a wide range of abnormalities within the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.
The highly magnified images can be used to evaluate the health of parts of the eye that include the following:
Optic nerve
Vitreous
Macula
Retina
Conditions Diagnosed with Digital Retinal Imaging
Digital retinal imaging allows for a comparison of the retina over time. Some of the conditions that may be detected with digital retinal imaging include the following:
Diabetic retinopathy
Macular degeneration
Glaucoma
Retinal detachment
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Digital retinal imaging can help track any changes within the retinal tissue that may indicate early signs of disease as well as assess the progression of certain diseases.
