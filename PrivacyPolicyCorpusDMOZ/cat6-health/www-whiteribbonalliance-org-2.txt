Organization does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction other than the United States. In choosing to access the Site, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. You are also subject to United States export controls and are responsible for any violations of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Organization grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Organization reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.
Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that you (and not Organization) are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband, and computer hardware, equipment, and services needed to access and use the Site, and paying all charges related thereto.
6. Purchases and Donations. If you wish to make a donation, contribution or purchase through the Site (each such donation, contribution or purchase, a “Transaction“), please note that we use a third party payment service, PayPal, to collect payments for such Transactions. If you wish to make a Transaction, you will be directed to a web page hosted by PayPal (or PayPal’s service providers) and not by us (the “PayPal Page“). Your use of the PayPal Page will be subject to PayPal’s user agreement and privacy policy, not this Agreement or our Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that we are not, and will not be, responsible or liable for PayPal’s services, its site or any acts or omissions of PayPal. We note that we reserve the right to discontinue or change any third party payment service used in connection with this Site.
7. Products, Content and Specifications. All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices of products described or depicted on this Site, are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products on this Site at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from this Site. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. All videocassettes, DVDs and similar products sold are for private, home use (where no admission fee is charged), non-public performance and may not be duplicated. Organization reserves the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any product; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all Transaction(s); and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product. Refunds and exchanges will be subject to Organization’s refund and exchange policies then in effect. You agree to pay all charges that may be incurred by you or on your behalf through the Site, at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred, including without limitation all shipping and handling charges. In addition, you remain responsible for any taxes that may be applicable to your Transactions.
8. Shipping Limitations. When an order is placed, it will be shipping to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is complete and compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on this Site. All purchases from this Site are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from this Site pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.
9. Accuracy of Information. We attempt to ensure that information on this Site is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the information on this Site may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currentness of any information on this Site. For example, products included on this Site may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on this Site. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. While it is our practice to confirm Transactions by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or donation or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.
10. Promotions. In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any contests, sweepstakes, surveys, games or similar promotions (collectively, “Promotions“) made available through the Site may be governed by specific rules that are separate from this Agreement. By participating in any such Promotion, you will become subject to those rules, which may vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein. Organization urges you to review any specific rules applicable to a particular Promotion, which will be linked from such Promotion, and to review our Privacy Policy which, in addition to this Agreement, governs any information you submit in connection with such activities. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules conflict with this Agreement, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.
11. Organization’s Proprietary Rights. The information and materials made available through the Site, including the Services, are and shall remain the property of Organization and its licensors and suppliers, and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and/or other proprietary rights and laws.
