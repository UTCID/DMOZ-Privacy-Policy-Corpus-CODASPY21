THIS SITE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL OR DENTAL ADVICE OR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL OR DENTAL SERVICES:  Please be aware that we are concerned with the well-being and health of all of our users.  However, the Site is provided only for informational purposes and to provide referral services, and we do NOT provide medical, dental or similar types of assistance or treatment services or similar advice.  The Site is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease and is not meant to be a substitute for any dental device, medicine, treatment or professional medical advice.  The Site does not replace the relationship between you and your dentist or other medical provider.  We are providing the information and referral services only as a courtesy to Site users.  You should seek professional care and advice in making any decisions relating to your physical or mental well-being.  Any action you take on the basis of the information provided on the Site is solely at your own risk.  In addition, never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Site!

B.          Community Usage Rules.  As a user of the Site, these Community Usage Rules (“Rules”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Site’s online forums and work spaces (collectively, “Communities”).
(i)  Nature of Rules.  Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
•  Your User-Generated Content.  All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.  Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.  Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.  If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to Company (for example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to Company as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.).
•  Speaking of Photos:  No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.  If you choose to submit photos to the Site, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
•  Act Appropriately.  All of your Site activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.  Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.  If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Site.  Cursing, harassing, bullying, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.  Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.  Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
•  Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.  Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
•  Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.  Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
•  Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content.  Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
•  Others Can See.  We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions about job search-related issues with other members.  However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Site within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.  Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
•  Don’t Share Other Peoples’ Personal Information.  Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by Company.
•  Don’t Damage the Site or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.  Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer or other Device.
If you submit User-Generated Content that Company reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.  However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.  We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.  Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Site.
(ii)  Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes.  You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Site, whether online or offline.  We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.  We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.  Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.
C.          Alerting Us of Violations.  If you discover any content that violates these Terms, then you may report it to us here.  For alleged infringements of intellectual property rights, see Sections 5 and 6 , below.
5.      Procedure For Alleging Copyright Infringement
A.           DMCA Notice.  Company will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as set forth below.  If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner’s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:
(i)   a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”;
(ii)     a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
(iii)   a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL or page of the Site on which the material appears);
(iv)   your full name, address, telephone number and email address;
(v)     a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
(vi)   a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and
(vii)      your electronic or physical signature.
Company will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail or email at the addresses below:
By Mail: Dentsply Sirona, Inc. 13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place Charlotte, NC 28277 (Attn: Dentistry.com- DMCA)
By email: DMCAfeedback@Dentistry.com
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.  Company may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Company may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.  That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
Without limiting Company’s other rights, Company may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by Company.
B.          Counter-Notification.  If access on the Site to a work that you submitted to Company is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.  Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:
(i)  a legend or subject line that says:  “DMCA Counter-Notification”;
(ii)  a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL or page of the Site from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
(iii)    a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
(iv)    your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;
(v)  a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and
(vi)    your electronic or physical signature.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.
If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.  However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.  You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.
6.      Procedure For Alleging Infringement of Other Intellectual Property
If you own intellectual property other than copyrights and believe that your intellectual property has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may send us a written notice to the addresses set forth above that includes all of the following:
(a)  a legend or subject line that says:  “Intellectual Property Infringement Notice”;
(b)  a description of the intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
(c)     a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL or page of the Site on which the material appears);
(d)     your full name, address, telephone number and email address;
(e)     a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner of the intellectual property, its agent, or the law;
(f)     a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner of the intellectual property at issue (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly infringed); and
(g)     your electronic or physical signature.

11.    Dispute Resolution
Certain portions of this Section 1 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Company agree that we intend that this Section 11 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 11 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
A.          First – Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.  If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, “Dispute”), or to any of Company’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an “Excluded Dispute”, which includes those actions set forth in Section 11(D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such contact information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 11(A). Your notice to us must be sent to Dentsply Sirona Inc., 13320 Ballantyne Corporate Place Charlotte, NC 28277 (Attn: Dentistry.com).  For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Company and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Company to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
B.          Binding Arbitration.  If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 11(A) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.  THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SITE (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT - INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY - AND WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS.  The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between Company and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Site, including the No Class Action Matters section below.  BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.
A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”), in accordance with the then-current streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of Company consent to in writing.  If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable rules; but if applicable rules or laws require Company to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 11 to be enforceable, then Company will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.  The arbitrator will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.  Issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions contained herein are for the court to decide.
C.          Limited Time to File Claims.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.  Commencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 11(A); (b) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth in Section 11(B); or (c) filing an action in state or Federal court.  The parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars, both legal and equitable, to the Disputes.
D.          Injunctive Relief.  The foregoing provisions of this Section 11 will not apply to any legal action taken by Company to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or Company’s intellectual property rights (including such Company may claim that may be in dispute), Company’s operations, and/or Company’s products or services.
E.          No Class Action Matters.  YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION.  Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.  But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 11(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 11(F).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this “No Class Action Matters” section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.  The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.
F.          Federal and State Courts in New York.  Except where arbitration is required above, small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in New York.  Accordingly, you and Company consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
G.          Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.

13.   LIMITATIONS OF OUR LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY COMPANY PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including personal injury or death or for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages that are directly or indirectly related to:

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.
Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief
IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY COMPANY (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF COMPANY.

(or only parts of it) and are not available worldwide.  We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service, or other feature described or available on the Site to any person, entity, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that we provide.  You and we disclaim any application to these Terms of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
E.          Severability; Interpretation.  If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect).  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.  Wherever the word “including” is used in these Terms or any Additional Terms, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation,”.
