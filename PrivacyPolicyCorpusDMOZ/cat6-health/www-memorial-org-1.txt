CHI Entity Terms and Conditions
Last Updated:  06/29/17
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OF A LOCAL HOSPITAL OR DIAL 911 IMMEDIATELY IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.
THIS IS A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND CHI.
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (Terms) CAREFULLY. By accessing and using this and other websites and mobile applications of Catholic Health Initiatives and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively referred to as CHI, us, our, or we), including without limitation www.catholichealthinitiatives.org, home.catholichealth.net, and other websites and mobile applications linking to these Terms (individually, a Site, and collectively, the Sites), you agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms are between you (sometimes referred to as you or your) and CHI.  Remember that your use of the Sites is at all times subject to the CHI Privacy Policy, which incorporates these Terms.  Print or download a copy of these Terms for your records.
If you are asked to click your agreement to specific terms and conditions to access certain functions on any of the Sites (each a Site Agreement), the terms in the Site Agreement shall govern over any inconsistencies with these Terms, but only for the specific Site function described in that Site Agreement. Each affiliate of Catholic Health Initiatives is controlled and operated by a separate and distinct legal entity. You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing a Site, the Site Agreement (if any) and these Terms create an agreement only between you and the individual affiliate, and you will not hold Catholic Health Initiatives responsible for the actions of any affiliate.
We may revise and update these Terms from time to time without prior notice to you and will post the updated Terms to the Sites. ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS WILL APPLY IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING TO THE SITES.  BY USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SITES, POSTING OR DOWNLOADING CONTENT OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION TO OR FROM THE SITES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO, THESE TERMS AND ANY CHANGES TO THEM.  IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THESE TERMS FOR SUCH CHANGES.
EMERGENCY OR URGENT MATTERS
No Site, including a Site through which you may communicate with a health care provider, should ever be used for emergency or urgent matters. If you believe that you or another individual for whom you have Proxy Access (as described under User Accounts below) needs to speak to a health care provider on an urgent basis you should contact the health care provider directly by phone.  FOR ALL MEDICAL EMERGENCIES AND URGENT MATTERS, PLEASE GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM OR DIAL 911 IMMEDIATELY.  The Site should not be used for emergency or urgent communications with any healthcare provider. The Site is not a substitute for appropriate and timely contact with a health care provider.
NO MEDICAL ADVICE
UNLESS YOU ARE COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THROUGH A SITE, YOU AGREE THAT PROVISION OF ANY INFORMATION FROM ANY SITE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE PRACTICE OF ANY MEDICAL, NURSING, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT.  Physicians performing services at CHI may be independent contractors and not employees, agents or representatives of CHI.
You are responsible for evaluating specific health care providers, treatments, information, content, products, and services that may be available through the Sites. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND CHI OR ANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, OR WHETHER ANY INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES YOU FIND ON THE SITES WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE THE RESULT(S) YOU WANT.
INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SITES OR ANY SITE-RELATED SERVICE IS INTENDED TO BE INFORMATIONAL ONLY. THE INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE, NOR SHOULD IT BE RELIED ON AS A COURSE OF TREATMENT. UNLESS YOU COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THROUGH A SITE, A SITE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PLACE OF A VISIT, CALL, CONSULTATION OR THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE SITE IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE AND DOES NOT COVER ALL DISEASES, AILMENTS, PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR THEIR TREATMENT. ALWAYS CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BEFORE BEGINNING A NEW TREATMENT, DIET OR FITNESS PROGRAM. YOU SHOULD NEVER DISREGARD MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU READ ON THE SITES.
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SITES IS COMPILED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES (INFORMATION PROVIDERS). NEITHER CHI NOR INFORMATION PROVIDERS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PRACTICE MEDICINE OR DISPENSE MEDICAL SERVICES AS PART OF THE SITES.
THE SITES MAY CONTAIN MATERIALS WHICH YOU FIND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT OR OTHERWISE OFFENSIVE. CHI ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH MATERIALS, AND USE OF THE SITES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
ELECTRONIC MESSAGING
In some instances, you may be able to send electronic messages to a health care provider through the Site.  In such instances, the anticipated turnaround time for response to electronic messages is three (3) business days, but no guarantee is made.  If a physician or other health care provider is unavailable, messages sent through the Site may be routed to other authorized health care providers in order to facilitate a timely response to your request. If you have not received a response to your inquiry within three (3) business days, please contact the health care provider directly.  Messages you send or receive through the Site may be made part of your medical record, or the medical record of the individual on whose behalf you are acting.
ACCESS TO MEDICAL INFORMATION
If a Site makes medical information from your medical record, or a medical record of an individual for whom you have Proxy Access, available to you, the information available through the Site does not necessarily reflect the complete contents of the medical record. The Site is designed for convenience purposes only, and CHI does not guarantee the Site contains the complete medical record or that the medical information that is made available is correct or accurate. To obtain a complete copy of the medical record you should contact the relevant health care provider directly.
CHI assumes no responsibility for how you use or disclose any medical information that may be made available to you through a Site.  If you utilize a Site to access your medical information, or another individual’s medical information to which you have been granted Proxy Access, you are responsible for ensuring that the computer systems you use to access the Site have appropriate security controls enabled and that you have accessed the Site through a secure connection.  You expressly assume the risk of any unauthorized disclosure or intentional intrusion, or of any delay, failure, interruption or corruption of data or other information that you transmit to or receive from the Site.  You are solely responsible for providing, maintaining and ensuring the compatibility of all hardware, software, electrical and other physical requirements necessary for your access to and use of the Site.
SURVEYS
From time-to-time a Site may request information from you via a survey. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary.  You have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information, which may include contact information (name and address) and demographic information (zip code and age level). Feedback collected by these surveys will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving use of the Site, and as specifically described in the survey itself.  Personal information gathered from surveys will be protected as described in the CHI Privacy Policy.
MOBILE DEVICES
Your contract with your mobile network provider (Mobile Provider) will continue to apply when accessing or using the Sites on your mobile, handheld device (Mobile Device). You understand that your Mobile Provider may charge you fees for your use of its network connection while accessing or using the Sites, for data downloading, e-mail, text messages, for roaming, and other Mobile Provider or third party charges.  You understand that the Sites are provided over the Internet and mobile networks, so the quality and availability of the Sites may be affected by factors outside our control. We do not guarantee that the Sites will be compatible or operate with your Mobile Provider’s service plans, with any particular Mobile Device, or other piece of hardware, software, equipment, or device you install on or use with your Mobile Device. We are not responsible if the Sites are unavailable or if you cannot download or access all content available on the Sites, for any compatibility or interoperability issues, or for any communication system failure which may result in the Sites being unavailable.
OVERVIEW OF CONTENT ON THE SITES
The Sites contain postings, text, images, messages, files, and other information and materials for download and viewing by individual Users (Users) of the Sites, made available by CHI and by advertisers, sponsors and other content contributors (Content Contributors). Portions of the Sites authored by CHI or its authorized agents, contractors, and employees are referred to as CHI Content. Portions of the Sites authored by Users are referred to as User Content. Portions of the Sites authored by other Content Contributors are referred to as Third Party Content.
Use and Accuracy of CHI Content
All CHI Content on the Sites is protected by federal and international copyright and intellectual property laws and is the property of CHI or its suppliers. No portion of the CHI Content may be reprinted, republished, modified, reproduced, or distributed in any form without the express written permission of CHI.  This restriction shall not apply to any medical information belonging to you or an individual for whom you have Proxy Access.
You may view or download CHI Content for your own personal use. You must keep intact any notices, including copyright notices, contained on any downloaded CHI Content and you must comply with any applicable end-user license agreements. With respect to CHI Content, any rights not expressly granted by these Terms or any applicable end-user license agreements are reserved by CHI.
Although CHI attempts to ensure the accurateness of the CHI Content, it makes no guarantees whatsoever as to its correctness or accuracy. It is possible that the CHI Content could include inaccuracies or errors, and that unauthorized additions, deletions and alterations could be made to CHI Content by third parties. In the event that an inaccuracy arises, please inform CHI so that it can be addressed. Information contained on the Sites may be changed or updated without notice.
Use of User Content and Third-Party Content
All User Content and Third-Party Content on the Sites are the responsibility of their respective owners. CHI is not responsible for User Content and Third-Party Content, and the views and opinions expressed in User Content and Third-Party Content are not necessarily those of CHI. CHI cannot, and does not, review User Content or Third-Party Content before they are made accessible through the Sites. Nevertheless, please be advised that User Content and Third-Party Content may be protected by federal and international copyright or other laws, and your right to reprint, republish, modify, reproduce, or distribute User Content or Third-Party Content may be limited accordingly.
YOUR USER ACCOUNT
If you are permitted to, and choose to, create an account on a Site, you are the only person authorized to access and use your account. You will not give your username, password, or any other account information to a third party. You must immediately notify us of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account or any known or suspected breach of security, including, but not limited to loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password. Additionally, you may change your password at any time.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ACTIVITY ON YOUR ACCOUNT. Any fraudulent, misleading, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your account at our sole discretion. We may refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies.
In some instances, your creation of an account on a Site will give you the ability to access your medical information that is maintained by a CHI health care provider through the Site.  In such instances, if you are an adult with legal capacity, you may request that another adult individual also be provided with access to your medical information through the Site.  The ability to access the medical information of another individual through a Site is called Proxy Access.  Additionally, if you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child or you are the personal representative of an incompetent adult, you may also be provided with Proxy Access to the minor child’s information or the incompetent adult’s information, as the case may be, provided however, Proxy Access to a minor child’s medical information if the minor child is age 12 or older may be limited or require the minor child’s permission due to certain federal and state law restrictions.  If you are granted Proxy Access, you will have access to the other individual’s medical information via the Site, through the creation of your own account on the Site.  Sharing accounts on a Site is prohibited.  To request or grant Proxy Access, you should contact your health care provider or the health information department at the CHI hospital where care was provided.
If you have Proxy Access and you later become aware that you are no longer authorized to access such individual’s medical information, due to termination of guardianship, parental rights, the prerogative of the individual, or otherwise, you agree to immediately discontinue your use of the Site to access the other individual’s medical information.
Your Content
Any change or update made to your account information, and all other postings, text, images, messages, files, or other materials you post, transmit through, or link to the Sites (collectively, Your Content) are your sole responsibility.
