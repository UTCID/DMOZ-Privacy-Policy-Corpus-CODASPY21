It is Angelman Syndrome Foundation policy to remove (flag) names from our mailing list immediately upon request.

The record is marked to receive no other mailings (flagged).
It is Angelman Syndrome Foundation policy not to remove names from our mailing list unless the request to take such action is communicated by Donors or their legal representatives. Requests to take such action by other third parties cannot be honored.
It is Angelman Syndrome Foundation policy to inform Donors requesting that their names be removed from our mailing list that they may contact the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) at (212) 790-1488 or via the World Wide Web at www.dmaconsumers.org to request that their names be placed on the national Pander List. This list is used by most nonprofit and commercial mailers similar to ASF to take reasonable care not to mail to those persons not wanting to receive any type of solicitation mail.
