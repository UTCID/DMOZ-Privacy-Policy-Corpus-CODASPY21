Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on
the user’s hard drive containing
information about the user. Usage of a
cookie is in no way linked to any personally
identifiable information while on our
site. Once the user closes their browser,
the cookie simply terminates. Cookies
enable us to track and target the interests
of our users to enhance the experience
on our site. Some of our business partners
use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers). However, we have no access
to or control over these cookies
E-Mail
E-mail addresses of viewers who have requested
further information or assistance will
remain confidential. These email addresses
will not be sold or shared with another
Web site.
Links
This web site contains links to other
sites. Please be aware that we vetLocator.com
are not responsible for the privacy practices
of such other sites. We encourage our
users to be aware when they leave our
site and to read the privacy statements
of each and every web site that collects
personally identifiable information. This

Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends,
administer the site, track user’s
movement, and gather broad demographic

Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information
with our partners and advertisers. This
is not linked to any personal information
that can identify any individual person.
Surveys
From time-to-time, our site requests information
from users via surveys or contests. Participation
in these surveys or contests is completely
voluntary and the user therefore has a
choice whether or not to disclose this
information. Information requested may
include contact information (such as name

information (such as zip code, age level).
Contact information will be used to notify
the winners and award prizes. Survey information
will be used for purposes of monitoring
or improving the use and satisfaction
of this site.
Notification of
Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy,
we will post those changes on our Homepage
