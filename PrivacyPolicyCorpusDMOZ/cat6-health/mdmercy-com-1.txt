Safe Harbor Regulations
For some time now, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been
examining safe harbors for physician referral programs. Complying with these
harbors guarantees that you will have no legal problems regarding the fraud and
abuse regulations. Foregoing the implementation of one or more of these harbors
does not guarantee a problem, but may put you in a riskier, grayer area of the
law. Proposed harbors were released in January 1989. The final harbors were
released in the Federal Register on July 29,1991.
As reported in this document, the following are the four standards:
The referral service does not exclude as a participant in the referral
service any individual or entity who meets the qualifications for participation.
Any payment the participant makes to the referral service is assessed equally
against and collected equally from all participants, and is only based on the
cost of operating the referral service, and not on the volume or value of any
referrals to or business otherwise generated by the participants for the
referrals to or business otherwise generated by the participants for the
referral service which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare or
State health care programs.
The referral service imposes no requirements on the manner in which the
participant provides services to a referred person, except that the referral
service may require that the participant charge the person referred at the same
rate as it charges other persons not referred by the referral service, or that
these services be furnished free of charge or at reduced charge.
The referral service makes the following five disclosures to each person
seeking a referral, with each such disclosure maintained by the referral service
in a written record certifying such disclosure and signed by either such person
seeking a referral or by the individual making the disclosure on behalf of the
referral service:
The manner in which it selects the group of participants in the referral
service to which it could make a referral.
Whether the participant has paid a fee to the referral service.
The manner in which it selects a particular participant from this group for
that person.
The nature of the relationship between the referral service and the group of
participants to whom it could make the referral.
The nature of any restrictions that would exclude such an individual or
entity from continuing as a participant.
