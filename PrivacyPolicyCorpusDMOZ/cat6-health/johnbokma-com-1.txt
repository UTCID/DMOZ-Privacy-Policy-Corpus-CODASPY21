The privacy of visitors to johnbokma.com is important to me.
I recognize that privacy of your personal information is
important.
Here is information on what types of personal
information I receive and collect when you use visit
johnbokma.com, and how I safeguard your information.
Information I collect through log files or comments posted
on this site will never be sold to third parties.
Log Files
As with most other websites, I collect and use the data
contained in log files. The information in the log files
include your IP address, the browser you used to visit our
site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you

Cookies and Web Beacons
Currently I use third party advertisements (Google AdSense) on
johnbokma.com to support my site. Some of these
advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web
beacons when they advertise on my site, which will also
send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google
AdSense program) information including your IP address,

whether you have Flash installed.
This is generally used
for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate
ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing
certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as
showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking
sites).

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve
ads on my site.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve

You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by
visiting the Google
ad and content network privacy policy.
Disabling Cookies
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off
third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by
managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet
Security.
However, this can affect how you are able to
interact with other websites.
This could include the
