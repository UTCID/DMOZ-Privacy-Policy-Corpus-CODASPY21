2020 Report on Legislation
Explains new laws that will impact hospitals in 2021
December 14, 2016
CHA’s 2020 Report
on Legislation summarizes the year’s most
significant health care-related bills and serves as a reference
tool to help hospitals comply with new laws.
Hospital leadership teams are encouraged to review the
report so they can take any necessary steps to implement new
requirements.
Statutory changes become effective Jan. 1, 2021, unless otherwise
noted. Each measure is categorized by subject and indicates which
hospital team members might be involved in compliance (see legend
at bottom of each page). In addition, the laws are indexed by
author, bill number, and staff role.

Modern Pricing
June 4, 2014
In October 2013, the CHA Board of Trustees adopted “Modern
Pricing,” an approach hospitals can voluntarily adopt to adjust
their charges to a level that is explainable and understandable,
and  reflects the unique cost structure of the hospital’s
mission and patient population.
In June 2014, CHA released a guide for member hospitals —
Modern Pricing: Clarifying Hospital Charges for
Consumers. To download a PDF of this guide and listen to a
recent CHA webinar on Modern Pricing, visit www.calhospital.org/modern-pricing-resources.
