Lower Back Pain
Lower back pain can range from dull aches to jolts of pain that stop you in your tracks. No matter what symptoms you’re experiencing, our team of experts works together to ease the pain and the hold it may have on your life. We offer a wide range of treatments, including physical therapy, injections, and minimally invasive surgery.
Lower back pain care at AHN: Why choose us?
Lower back pain often strikes when you least expect it, which is why you need quick, easy access to care. Physical therapists at Allegheny Health Network (AHN) have direct access certification, meaning we can treat you without a physician referral. You may continue working with our therapists for up to 30 days. Find out more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
When surgery is necessary, we use sophisticated procedures to repair structures in your lower back through tiny incisions. AHN is often among the first programs in western Pennsylvania offering these minimally invasive technologies. Patients typically experience safer, more precise care and a quicker return to their favorite activities. Find out more about our Spine Division.
Causes of lower back pain
Many conditions can cause lower back pain, including:
Arthritis
Complications from osteoporosis
Fractures or small breaks in the bones of your spine
Nerve problems, including sciatica
Orthopaedic trauma, such as injuries from a car accident
Sports injuries, including sprains and strains
Structural spine problems, such as a slipped (herniated) disk
Treatments for lower back pain
You may find pain relief through nonsurgical treatments. We consider the diagnosis along with the results of any previous treatments to develop a care plan that’s right for you. Your treatment may include:
Medication: You may feel better with an over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen. If the pain is severe, we may recommend prescription medication.
Injections: We inject pain-relieving medications to relieve irritation deep within your spine. Injections such as cortisone are available through our primary care sports medicine doctors.
Physical therapy: We guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your lower back. We also show you how to perform stretches at home to relieve stiffness. Read more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
Surgery: We do everything possible to help you avoid surgery. However, if other treatments fail to bring relief, a surgical procedure may offer you the best outcome. We may recommend a procedure to join (fuse) spine bones that have become unstable. Find out more about orthopaedic surgery.
Preventive services: If you’ve injured your lower back, it’s possible for the pain to come back even after treatment. We offer many services, including strength training, to lower your risk for future problems. Read more about sports performance services.
