Person-centered care creates results when applied to both strategy and day-to-day operations.
Creating a Standard of Person-Centered Care Your Journey Starts with Planetree
Person-centered care yields internal, external, financial and cultural benefits to healthcare organizations. It engages patients, aligns with today’s mandates for better population health management and improves organizational performance in quality, safety and experience.
Improve Organizational Performance and Outcomes+
Support in creating lasting change that leads your organization from its current state to where you want to be. Building this capacity to drive change takes a defined vision, an understanding of your stakeholders’ experiences and priorities, engaged leadership and effective organizational structures.
Addressing these challenges and pain points:
Disconnect between organizational strategy and day-to-day behaviors
Inefficiency and lack of coordination due to organizational silos
Leadership challenges
Resistance to change/transition fatigue
Maintaining or building culture during a merger or acquisition
Market differentiation
Need for a “from good to great” roadmap
Improve Staff Engagement and Performance+
Success in providing person-centered care is rooted in creating a positive workplace culture. Planetree’s staff engagement offerings provide the building blocks for enhancing team dynamics and unlocking your staff’s potential to create results they feel proud of.
Addressing these challenges and pain points:
Burnout and turnover
Retention and recruitment issues
Poor communication
Lack of teamwork or trust between colleagues/disciplines/departments
Improve Patient and Family Engagement and Outcomes+
Partnering with you to adopt new perspectives and adapt care delivery practices to engage patients and families in their care. These services emphasize not only providing an exceptional patient experience, but also improving health outcomes, overall well-being and quality of life. This shift in emphasis from providing care and services for individuals to providing care with them is not only good for patients, but also for your organization’s reputation, market share and profitability.
Addressing these challenges and pain points:
Under performance on patient experience measures
Poor communication (lack of courtesy and respect, not explaining things in a way patients can understand)
Lack of standardization in implementing engagement practices
Marginalized patient/family voice (in continuous improvement and at the point of care)
Improve the Health of Your Community+
Person-centered care doesn’t end once an individual leaves your facility. Their health outcomes depend on their ability to manage their care, adopt healthy behaviors and access needed services. We will partner with you to put in place strategies to leverage community resources to create a more person-centered continuum of care. And true to our belief that the measure of quality must be how well systems, structures and processes meet the needs of those hardest to reach and with the most complex needs, these services are designed to ensure your person-centered approaches meet the unique needs of aging populations and those with chronic conditions, including behavioral health.
Addressing these challenges and pain points:
Lack of coordination and continuity during transitions of care and services
Access challenges
High readmission rates
Challenges engaging the hardest to reach patients
