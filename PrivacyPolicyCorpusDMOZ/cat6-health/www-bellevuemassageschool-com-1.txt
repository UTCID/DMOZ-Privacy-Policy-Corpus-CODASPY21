They helped me find me a job immediately with an awesome spa, and have answered any questions I had post graduation. If you are looking for a new career as a massage therapist I highly recommend Bellevue Massage School.- Tyler, 2017 GraduateThe teachers at BMS are caring and knowledgeable, and the small class sizes mean a lot of 1-on-1 attention!- Jeff, 2017 GraduateMenuSUBMITHomeSitemap
