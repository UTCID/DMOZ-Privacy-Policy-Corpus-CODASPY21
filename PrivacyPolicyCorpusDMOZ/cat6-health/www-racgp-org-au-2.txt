General practice policy and procedure templates
Resources for use in general practice
The following general practice policy and procedure templates will assist general practices to meet their professional and legislative obligations when providing clinical care, whilst also supporting day to day business activities.
These templates can also assist practices to meet and maintain accreditation in accordance with the RACGP Standards for general practices (5th edition). Please note the templates should be viewed as a general guide only and practices must implement their own judgement and skill in creating documents and policies which suit their individual practice. It is recommended practices seek professional advice where necessary for their own particular circumstances.
If you have a recommendation or suggestion for a template, please email the Practice Technology and Management team at practicesystems@racgp.org.au
