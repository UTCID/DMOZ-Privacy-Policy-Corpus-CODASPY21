Coronavirus Update
You’ve taken every precaution, and so have we.
Learn About Our Patient Safety and Screening Measures
With the safety of our patients and team members at the forefront, we are
taking the appropriate precautions and using best practices to continue
to ensure the highest quality care, protection, support and comfort for
all of our patients.
Our dedication to serving the people of New Jersey extends far beyond the
care we provide within our hospital walls. We support programs that promote
health and wellness in our communities and provide access to services
that would otherwise be unavailable. We are committed to the ongoing improvement
of the health, quality of life, and vitality of our communities. We strive
to bring the best healthcare to meet the evolving needs of residents in
New Jersey—whether that be enhancing the coordination for treating
complex health conditions or improving community health through local
programs and education.
Our partnership with Rutgers University creates the state’s largest
academic healthcare system dedicated to providing high-quality patient
care, leading-edge research, and world-class health and medical education,
further advancing our mission of providing high-quality healthcare in
New Jersey.
The new collaboration also aligns RWJBarnabas Health with Rutgers’
education, research, and clinical activities, including those at the
Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and
Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care.
Mission
RWJBarnabas Health– as the leading academic health system in New
Jersey – is advancing innovative strategies in high quality patient
care, education and research to address both the clinical and social determinants
of health.
