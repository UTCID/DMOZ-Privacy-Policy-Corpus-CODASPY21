HEALTH AND INVESTMENT DISCLAIMERS
Tivity is not a health plan or health insurance company. We do provide our services to health plans and to employers who in turn make our services available to their eligible members and employees. If you have a question about your health benefits or medical benefits, call your health plan or employer for assistance.
The Services do not provide medical advice. Tivity is not a health care provider. We don’t offer health care services through Our products or programs. None of the information on the Services, Our programs or Our products is intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. If You have any question at all about a medical condition, medicine, or prescription, contact Your physician or health care provider. Please don’t rely on any of the information on the Services or any of Our programs or products to determine a medical diagnosis or treatment. And, don’t delay seeking medical advice for any condition You have or suspect You have an emergency. IN AN EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE NUMBER.
Exercise Programs. Some of the services Tivity offers include exercise or activity programs. If You are engaged in any of those programs, You should always consult with a physician before You begin any exercise activity or program because any exercise activity involves a risk of injury.

The Services may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

They typically use words such as or similar to “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe.”
Forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors may have a significant impact on actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about the performance of Tivity’s stock or business. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. You should review our SEC filings for more information on these and other factors that could affect Tivity.
Please note that the Services provide access to historical or previously posted materials. Typically, such materials will be located in a distinct section of the Services, but please take note of the date provided in connection with materials accessed through the Services. In addition, the Services from time to time include summaries or synopses of relevant information. Whenever possible, Tivity attempts to make clear that such information is not a complete analysis and provide reference to more comprehensive information or analysis. Should you desire additional information with respect to such summaries or synopses, please review our SEC filings at www.sec.gov.
