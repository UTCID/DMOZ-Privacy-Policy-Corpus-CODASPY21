Heart Valve Disease
Heart valves open and close with each heartbeat to keep blood flowing into and out of the heart’s four chambers. If you have heart valve disease, one or more of the valves isn’t working properly. This condition affects blood flow and can lead to heart failure and other serious problems.
The heart specialists at the Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Cardiovascular Institute are nationally renowned for treating all types of heart valve problems. We’re experts at minimally invasive surgeries for patients who can’t undergo open-heart procedures.
Types of heart valve disease
The different types of heart valve disease include:
Regurgitation: An improperly closing heart valve allows blood to flow back into the heart. This condition may lead to arrhythmia, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.
Stenosis: A heart valve narrows, causing your heart to work harder to pump blood. Stenosis increases your risk of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmia.
