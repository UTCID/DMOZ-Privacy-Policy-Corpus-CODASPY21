The Linnaeus Group reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification hereunder.

10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
These Terms are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the  England and Wales. and are binding upon the parties hereto in England and Wales and worldwide. You and the Linnaeus Group agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
YOU AND THE LINNAEUS GROUP AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10 AND THAT YOU AND MARS WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW.
YOU AND THE LINNAEUS GROUP FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Any dispute between you and The Linnaeus Group and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this Section 10, “Linnaeus Group Parties”) arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitration (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration in the United Kingdom administered by the LCIA in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in effect on the date thereof.
Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. The Linnaeus Group will provide such notice by mail or e-mail using the contact information on file with The Linnaeus Group and you must provide such notice by mail to The Linnaeus Group, Attn: Legal Department, Linnaeus Group
Friars Gate, 1011 Stratford Road, Shirley, West Midlands, B90 4BN.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the LCIA rules. If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, The Linnaeus Group will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you. If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse The Linnaeus Group for all fees associated with the arbitration that The Linnaeus Group paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the LCIA rules.
A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the LCIA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. The arbitrator’s decision must be with written explanation and remain confidential.
The Linnaeus Group and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither The Linnaeus Group nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private-attorney action and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this Section 10, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
Please Note: By agreeing to these Terms, you explicitly agree that any claims or actions that you may otherwise have against The Linnaeus Group under the laws of any jurisdiction outside  England and Wales are hereby waived, including without limitation, any claims or actions under the laws of your own country, and that your sole location and applicable law for any dispute is in  England or Wales according to the terms of this Section 10.
11. TERMINATION
These Terms automatically terminate when you fail to comply with any term or condition of them. Mars may terminate or modify your access to the Mars Sites, with or without notice to you, at any time for any reason. For example, access to the Mars Sites may be denied without notice if Mars believes that you are not at least age 13.
Termination will not limit any of Mars’ other rights or remedies. This Section 11, along with Sections 3, 8, 9, 10 and 16, survive termination of these Terms.
