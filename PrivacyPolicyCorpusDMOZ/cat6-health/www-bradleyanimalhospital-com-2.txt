Appointment Policy
To allow ample time for all patients and scheduled surgical procedures, we operate primarily by appointment. Emergency cases shall always receive top priority, which is why occasional appointment delay is inevitable. Please realize that we make a sincere attempt to see each client on time.
For your convenience, 'admit' appointments are available. An 'admit' means you can bring your pet at the time that works best for you and leave him/her with us for a few hours or the entire day. Usually we will ask you to admit sometime in the morning so our doctors can examine the patient in between appointments or at the time purposely reserved for admitted patients. Once the doctor is done, he/she can call you to go over the diagnosis and to give you discharge instructions.   For the safety of all animals in our care, we require that all vaccinations be up to date. Even though we make every effort to make our patients feel comfortable during visits, they may be a little uneasy about new people, new surroundings and other pets. This is one of the reasons we ask you to restrain your pet. We recommend that animals be placed on a leash or in pet carriers before entering the reception area.
Payment Policy
We require full payment at the time that services are rendered. For your convenience, we accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Care Credit, American Express and cash.
Patient Arrival Policy
For your protection, and that of others, all dogs must be on a leash and properly controlled while in the waiting area or exam rooms. All cats must be presented in an appropriate cat carrier or on a leash.
