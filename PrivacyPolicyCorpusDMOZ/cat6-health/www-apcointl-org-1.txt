[Scroll to the bottom of this policy for other event-related sites open for portions of the year.]
Information Collection
When you submit a form, login, make a transaction or similar, we will only ask for personal data that is necessary for us to respond to your request.  In the course of serving our members and customers, APCO collects some basic personal information from you, including your name, email, phone number, organizational affiliation and postal address.  We may also collect payment and financial information when necessary to process an order or purchase you make.
Use of Cookies and Log Files
Like many web sites, our Sites set and use cookies to enhance your user experience, such as retaining your personal settings. By using our Sites, you consent to the use of cookies and log files.
APCO uses the information we receive from cookies and other locally stored data to enhance your experience with APCO's websites, better understand your user preferences and interactions with our websites, and to generally improve the safety and functionality of our websites and the services they provide.
In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties’ cookies to report usage statistics of the Sites, deliver advertisements on and through the service, and so on.
You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
Use of Personal Data
APCO uses the personal data it collects to provide you with the service that you have requested, or to respond to an inquiry that you have made.  In serving our members and customers, we use your personal data to create registration records, course completion records, and membership and association service records.  For instance, APCO uses your data to create a verifiable record of:
participation in events, webinars, and classes;
certifications and continuing education credits;
membership and participation on association committees or standards working groups; and
service in APCO leadership roles.
All of this personal data is retained as part of your professional record with APCO as a means to demonstrate your engagement in the profession, support your career advancement and validate your eligibility for association honors such as senior and life member.
APCO may use personal data to determine user interests, needs and preferences, to conduct research and analysis, to manage and maintain the Sites and our services, to comply with our legal and compliance obligations, to exercise and defend our legal rights, or to comply with court orders.
We will also use the information to communicate with you by email about APCO events, news, and important bulletins.  APCO may also use personal information for marketing purposes and will obtain your consent for such purpose for users located in the European Union / European Economic Area.
Data Retention
APCO retains personal data for so long as it is necessary for us to comply with our legitimate business requirements, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide services that you have requested, and to enforce our agreements.
Disclosures of Personal Data
APCO may share your personal information with select business partners for marketing and research purposes. APCO may also share your personal information with third party service providers who assist us in providing the Sites and our services to you.  Our third party service providers are bound to keep your personal information confidential.
Hyperlinks
The Sites contain links to other websites, including without limitation those websites of companies identified as official vendors or sponsors. Their inclusion does not imply any endorsement or validation by us of the content of said websites. APCO International is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites, nor do we accept any liability in connection with the content of such websites.
Security of Personal Data
APCO is committed to keeping your data safe.  As part of our business operations we maintain appropriate security measures to prevent security breaches and unauthorized disclosure of client data.  Any financial data requested and transmitted through our Sites are transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets a web browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before it is sent to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage is 100% secure. Since no data security measures are foolproof, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted or stored via our software and systems.
Global Users
APCO is located and established in the United States and therefore, your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States.  While the data protection, privacy and other laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take necessary and appropriate steps to protect the security and privacy of your personal information.  By using the Sites or requesting services from us, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of your personal data to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
Your Rights to Access and Control Your Information
You have the right to review and request a copy of the personal data that we store about you, if any.  You also have the right to change or correct any data we have about you, ask us to delete your personal data, or express concern you have about our use of your information.  You can review and make changes to your account profile by logging into the Sites.
You may request that we stop sending such communications at any time, and you have the right to request that APCO remove your data from our databases.  You can manage your communication preferences online. Go to www.myapcointl.org and click on “Manage Correspondence” in the right corner. All of our email communications contain an unsubscribe link.  If you wish to stop receiving a particular communication from us, you will be able to do so by following the unsubscribe link in our emails.  If you wish to have your data deleted from all records, please be advised that this may affect your membership, training, certification, or eligibility for honors status.  However, should you wish to have your information purged from APCO data or if you have other requests, please email us (data@apcointl.org).  We will seek to accommodate your requests, including requests for deletion, as required by applicable law.
