Terms & Conditions
Terms & Conditions
All prices are subject to change without prior notice. We reserve the right to refuse business and/or to terminate services with anyone for any reason at anytime.
Refund Policy
AATBS has a seven (7) day return policy. This period begins upon receipt of the material and extends for a period of seven (7) days. Customers must notify AATBS within this 7-day period should they elect to return unused materials. AATBS does not accept used items, damaged items, or items removed from their shrink wrap. Upon receipt of return authorization from AATBS, customers must ship materials to AATBS at their own expense via a trackable shipping method (i.e., carrier assigns tracking number to shipment). AATBS will not accept packages or process refunds without return authorization by our office. Shipping charges are nonrefundable. In addition, there will be a 20% cancellation/restocking fee, charged to customers, for all cancelled orders and/or returned materials. No refunds or partial refunds will be granted for online products that have been registered. Customers may elect to cancel an unregistered online program within 7 days of purchase; however, there will be a 20% cancellation fee.
Online Programs Policy
A customer who purchases any of our online programs is purchasing an individual license to use AATBS’s proprietary software. Our online programs are comprised of multiple platforms provided in a way to be operated by an individual and will be defined as software. Software consists of carefully organized instructions and code written by programmers in any of various special computer languages. They may be delivered as, but not limited to a web application, mobile application, and/or desktop application.
The purchaser will be granted a license to access the software upon receipt of funds. Access to the software will typically be provided at time of purchase, but may vary dependent on the product. Technical support will be available during business hours should an issue arise. This license is granted to only the original purchaser and, as such, purchaser is not permitted to sell, lend, assign, lease, or transfer in any other way any copy or use of the software. This license is non-transferable. Purchaser also may not sell, lend, assign, lease, or transfer in any other way remaining time to use the software. Any violation of this provision is not permitted and may cause program to be terminated with no refund of the licensing fee paid.
All online programs are active for a limited time period. All online program access starts at time of purchase. If you need to request a hold on your access, please contact our customer service team at 800-472-1931, Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PT, Saturday 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. PT.
