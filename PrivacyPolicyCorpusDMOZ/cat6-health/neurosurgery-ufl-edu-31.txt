The physicians of the clinical faculty of the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida provide outstanding care for patients with neurological illness via a team approach. A team will be composed of the faculty member as the head of the team, three or more resident physicians and one Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner.
This care includes the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, interpretation of imaging, treatment, critical care, and rehabilitation of disorders of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems.
Specific examples of neurosurgical therapies include:
The surgical, nonsurgical and stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of adult and pediatric patients with tumors of the nervous system
Disorders of the brain, meninges, skull, including skull base, and their blood supply, including the surgical and endovascular treatment of disorders of the intracranial and extracranial vasculature supplying the brain and spinal cord
Disorders of the pituitary gland
Disorders of the spinal cord, meninges, and vertebral column, including those that may require treatment by fusion, instrumentation, or endovascular techniques
Disorders of the cranial, peripheral and spinal nerves throughout their distribution.
