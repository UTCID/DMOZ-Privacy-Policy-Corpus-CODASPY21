Patient Notice of Privacy Practice
The Notice of Privacy Practices (NOP) describes how medical information may be used and disclosed and how to request access to this information.
SUNY Downstate Medical Center Health Science Center at Brooklyn is required by law
to notify patients of the uses and disclosures of their protected health information
(PHI). The NOPs listed in the table below describe the individual rights of DMC patients
with respect to PHI in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
act of 1996 (HIPAA) and its accompanying regulations.
More specific Notices of Privacy Practices are also available describing special categories
(HIV, Mental Health, Alcohol & Substance Abuse) of patient information for which greater
privacy protections are afforded in compliance with HIPAA and New York State Law.
