Privacy Policy
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is the 1996 Federal law that restricts access to individuals’ private medical information. HIPAA requires organizations to provide patients with a notice explaining their rights and how the provider may use their health information. The notice informs patients of their rights to: inspect the medical record; request changes to the record; view of list of disclosures of their record; and request confidential communications. These notices are given to every patient throughout the hospital and are available for review in waiting areas.
If you need immediate assistance, please call our main hospital line at (940) 549-3400.
