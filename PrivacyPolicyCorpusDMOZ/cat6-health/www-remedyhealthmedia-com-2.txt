Unless otherwise expressly stated, these terms and conditions are the “Terms of Use” for the Sites and represent a legally binding agreement between you and us regarding your use of our Sites. Your legal agreement with us also includes our Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms and conditions that we disclose or notify you of when you use or attempt to use our Sites (“Additional Terms”)
Our Sites include all web pages within each Site and also include backup, mirror, replacement or substitute sites or pages we make available as part of the services we provide. We will refer to each and every feature, function, service, activity, promotion and content on our Sites, individually and/or collectively as “Content” and when we use the term “Site” it also includes Content unless we specifically say otherwise. Any terms used but not defined herein are defined in our Privacy Policy.
We may refer to you or any individual that uses our Sites as “you” or “your” or a “user.” If we use the term “RHM Entities,” in addition to us, that term means and includes our sponsors, affiliates, suppliers, promotional partners, operational service providers, agents and representatives.
When you see the word “use” or “using” we mean any time you, directly or indirectly, attempt to or actually do access, interact, display, view, browse, print, copy, transmit, receive or exchange data, messages, content or you otherwise communicate with us or anyone else, including another user, advertiser or any person, firm or business you may encounter on or through any of our Sites. We will also consider you to be using our Sites if you utilize, benefit, take advantage of or interact with any Content in, on or available through any of our Sites, for any purpose, or if you try to do any of these things.
If you use any of our Sites you agree and acknowledge that (i) you have read and understand the legal agreement you have with us, including these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms; (ii) that unless you immediately stop using or trying to use all of our Sites, you will be signifying your agreement to be legally bound by and comply with all of the terms and conditions that apply to you under these Terms of Use; and (iii) you must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if different. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction then you may only use the Sites with your parent or legal guardian’s permission. As set forth in our Privacy Policy, our Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information (as that term is defined in the Privacy Policy) from children under the age of 13.
2.	HEALTH INFORMATION DISCLAIMER.
The Content on our Sites is presented in a summary fashion, and is intended to be used for informational purposes only. The Content is not intended to be and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for a specific treatment plan, product, course of action or medical or healthcare provider. Your use of our Sites does not create a doctor / patient relationship. RHM IS NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. OUR SITES DO NOT OFFER MEDICAL ADVICE AND NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE CONTENT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. You should not use our Sites to diagnose a health or fitness problem or disease. Use of our Sites does not replace medical consultations with a qualified health or medical professional to meet the health and medical needs of you or any other party. We disclaim all responsibility for the professional qualifications and licensing of, and services provided by, any physician or other health provider referred to on our Sites and/or any Third Party (as defined in our Privacy Policy) website. Never disregard the medical advice of a physician or health professional, or delay in seeking such advice, because of something you read on our Sites. Although we strive to ensure that the information we provide on our Sites is correct, we cannot guarantee that it is always accurate and up-to- date. We offer our Sites AS IS and without any warranties.
3.	WE CAN CHANGE OUR SITES AND OUR TERMS OF USE.
We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in our sole discretion, to add to, delete or modify any or all the terms of the Terms of Use that apply to you, as well as any of our Sites and/or any Content. We display the effective date of these Terms of Use at the top of this page. If you use any of the affected Sites after the changes become effective, it means you are agreeing to be bound by the changes. You should check on a regular and frequent basis and review the terms and conditions that apply to you so you are aware of the current rights and obligations that apply to you.
4.	PRIVACY.
Our Privacy Policy is available on this Site, and by accessing any of our Sites, you are agreeing to be bound by the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms, along with the Terms of Use, form a part of our agreement with you. Read our Privacy Policy carefully since it describes, among other things, how we collect and use information we obtain when you use our Sites.
5.	OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT AND LICENSE TO YOUR CONTENT.
Each of our Sites and, except as described below, all Content, are either the property of RHM or the property of our licensors, third party authors, developers, operational service providers, advertisers, vendors, or users (collectively, “Third Party Providers”) and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and treaties. To avoid any doubt, when we use “Content” it includes, but isn’t limited to, such things as software, code, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, animations, audio, video and audio-visual material, art, graphic material, proprietary information, data, databases, service marks, trademarks, trade names, distinctive identification such as logos, the selection, sequence, “look and feel” and arrangement of items and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable elements of any and all of our Sites. All product names, company names, marks, logos, and symbols may be the trademarks of their respective owners.
You keep ownership to any and all Content that is yours and if you submit or provide Content to any of our Sites, these Terms of Use do not deprive you or any holder of your or their rights. However, when you do submit or provide Content to us or any of our Sites, you are giving us an unconditional, irrevocable, transferable, royalty free worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, perform, adapt,
translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute, disseminate and/or broadcast that Content (“license”) and you are representing and warranting to us you have all necessary rights, consents, and/or permissions to give us such license. If you do not have the right to license Content to us (or if you are not sure), do not submit or provide Content to us.
You may only use our Content and Content of Third Party Providers for your own personal use and you have no right to transfer, assign or use the Content for any other purpose or allow or enable anyone else to do so. Personal use excludes all commercial or charitable functions, whether or not money or other consideration is involved, whether or not it is for your benefit or for someone else. You may not use, display, reproduce, perform, adapt, translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute, disseminate and/or broadcast Content that is not yours without our express prior written consent. You may not alter, delete or conceal copyright or other notices, even if we let you download, display, print or share the Content with others. Unauthorized or prohibited use of Content may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both under federal, state and local laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, please also see Section 7 in our Privacy Policy entitled “Your Rights” for a description of how you may protect your Personal Information.
6.	POSTING.
Some or all of our Sites may allow you to register, create a profile or account and enable you to submit, provide, furnish, transmit, exchange, communicate and/or display Content (referred to as “Posting” or “Postings”).

Unless and until you notify us that you know or suspect the security of your user identification, login and password may have been compromised, so are Postings made by anyone else if they are using your registration, profile, user account or login identification or password and you will defend and indemnify us (See the section entitled “YOU INDEMNIFY US” below) for any such Postings.
