TUHS PRACTICES REGARDING THE USE AND RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION:
TUHS understands that medical information about you and your health is personal and is committed to protecting your medical information. A record is created of the care and services you receive as a patient. This record is needed to provide you with quality care, document the provision of appropriate medical services, and seek reimbursement for those services. Our privacy practices apply to all of the records of your care generated, or utilized, by our Health Care Professionals to provide you with healthcare services.
The purpose of this notice is to inform you about the ways in which your protected health information may be used and disclosed. It also describes your rights and other obligations regarding the use and disclosure of your protected health information.
TUHS IS REOUIRED BY LAW TO:
ensure that protected health information is kept private;
provide you with this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your protected health information;
notify you if we determined that the security of your Protected Health Information
was compromised because of a Breach.
follow the terms of the Notice that are currently in effect.
We reserve the right to change our privacy practices from time to time in accordance with law. The then current Notice will be provided at the time of service, and is available upon request, as well as prominently posted in a public area.
HOW TUHS MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU:
FOR TREATMENT - Your medical information may be used to provide you with appropriate treatment and services. The physicians, nurses, technicians, and other health care personnel involved in your care may have access to your medical records. In addition, other TUHS personnel may be required to know only certain facts concerning your medical treatment in order to provide appropriate care. For example, a physician treating a patient for a broken leg will need to know if the patient is diabetic, or the physician may need to inform the hospital dietitian about a patient?s diabetes to provide appropriate meals. Different departments within TUHS may also need to share personal medical information in order to coordinate care such as x-rays, lab work or prescriptions. Medical information may also be disclosed to arrange appropriate medical care after discharge.
FOR PAYMENT - Protected Health Information may also be disclosed so that the treatment and services received may be billed to an insurance company or other third party payor such as Medicare. For example, protected health information may be disclosed to the patient?s insurance company in order to facilitate reimbursement. Some insurance companies require this disclosure prior to the initiation of treatment in order to determine the extent of coverage.
FOR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS - Protected Health Information may be disclosed to ensure that TUHS is providing quality care. For example, medical information may be used to evaluate the performance of staff, or to educate staff. Doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, and other TUHS personnel may utilize your medical information for educational purposes. In such situations, effort will be made to remove any information which may identify the patient.
FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN CARE - Protected Health Information may be disclosed to family members or friends. Patients may limit or restrict the release of information to certain individuals. See the Right to Restrictions section of this Notice.
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES
A Health Information Exchange (HIE) is a way to share your medical information
electronically with your healthcare providers outside of TUHS. The goal is to make it
easier for providers to have access to your records for treatment and care coordination.
Temple University Health System (TUHS) participates in several Health Information
Exchanges. Currently we participate in the following HIEs: Jeanes Care Connect, EPIC
and HealthShare Exchange of Southeastern Pennsylvania, Inc. In the future, we may
participate in other HIEs. HIE participants may include hospitals, physician and health
plans. TUHS carefully protects your information by confirming that these HIE's have
safety measures to protect the confidentiality of your information. In addition, HIEs
have to comply with federal laws that apply specific requirements to protect the Privacy
and Security of your information.
HIE's store information sent by a Hospital or a physician about a specific patient.
Information available could include present and old information about your conditions,
medications, drug allergies, immunizations, laboratory and procedure test results,
care plan, and demographics. This information may have a link to AIDS/HIV, drugs or
alcohol addiction, psychiatric and or reproductive health problems. If you do not want
these records shared, you need to Opt-Out of the Health Information Exchanges.
Your participation in health information exchange is encouraged. However, if you
prefer, you can choose not to participate in HIEs. This process is called opting out.
You may still receive care at a TUHS affiliate, but hospitals and physicians not affi- liated
with TUHS will not be able to access medical information electronically, even in case
of emergency. If you want to Opt-Out of the HIEs, please contact your provider or the
Privacy officer at the facility you are receiving care for an Opt-Out form. If you change
your mind, you can cancel your Opt-Out by completing the Opt-Out revocation form. It
may take up to five (5) business days of receipt to process your request. Refer to end
of this Notice for the Privacy Officer's contact information.
AS REQUIRED BY LAW - Protected Health Information may be disclosed as required by federal, state, or local law. This may include mandatory reporting to public health officials, the FDA and others.
ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATIONS - If you are an organ donor, medical information may be disclosed to organizations which are involved in organ procurement, as necessary, to facilitate organ or tissue donations and transplantations.
HEALTH RELATED BENEFITS AND SERVICES - TUHS may use and disclose medical information to inform you, or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of benefit to you, or remind you of appointments.
CORONERS, MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND FUNERAL DIRECTORS - Protected Health Information may be released to a coroner or medical examiner to, for example, determine a cause of death or identify a deceased person.
SENSITIVE INFORMATION - Federal and State laws requires additional protection for sensitive medical information in the following categories: drug and alcohol, mental health, HIV/AIDS and genetic testing. Generally, you will be asked for a written authorization before this type of information is released. However, there are limited circumstances under the law when this information may be released without your consent.
RESEARCH - A covered entity may use or disclose protected health information for research purposes pursuant to authorization by an Institutional Review Board ("IRB"). The IRB is an organizational committee that reviews and approves biomedical research that involves human subjects. Research that does not have approval for a consent waiver will require your written authorization before your Protected Health Information may be used.
FUNDRAISING - We may use and disclose your demographic information and the dates that you received treatment to contact you for fundraising activities supported by us. If we contact you for fundraising purposes, you will be provided with the opportunity to opt out of receiving any future solicitations.
OTHER USES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
Other uses of medical information not covered by this notice will only be made with your written permission. For example, most uses and disclosures of psychotherapy notes and of Protected Health Information for marketing purposes and the sale of Protected Health Information require an authorization. The most common reasons we would seek your authorization to use your health information would be for research purposes or to respond to media inquiries. This authorization may be revoked by you at any time.
YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR MEDICAL INFORMATION.
You have the following rights regarding medical information we maintain about you:
Right to Inspect and Copy: You have the right to inspect and copy medical information that may be compiled while we are providing care. This does not apply to psychotherapy notes. Requests for the inspection or copying of medical records must be in writing to the Medical Records Department or your physician?s office. There will be an appropriate fee for copying. A request for review or copying will be responded to in most instances within 30 days, and may be denied in very limited circumstances. Such a decision shall be reviewed by the Facility Privacy Officer and, if appropriate, a licensed health care professional not associated with the original denial. An appeal of such a decision is available and may be requested by submitting a written request for appeal to the TUHS Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer. You may reach the TUHS Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer at (215) 707-5605.
Right to Amend: You have the right to request that any medical information, which is maintained by the facility, be amended if it is incorrect or incomplete. Such a request must be in writing and forwarded to the medical records department of the facility, which provided the service, or to your physician?s office. The request may be denied if the request is to amend information that:
was not created by TUHS, unless the person or entity that created the information is no longer available to make the amendment;
is not part of the medical information maintained by TUHS;
is not part of the information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or
is accurate and complete.
Right to an Accounting of Disclosures: You have the right to request an "accounting of disclosures"? which is a listing of disclosures made of your medical information. Such a request must be in writing to the Medical Records Department (Health Information Management) of the facility, which is providing the service, or to your physician'?s office in the case of office records. The time frame cannot be longer than six years, and the first request within a 12-month period will be provided at no cost. Appropriate charges will be assessed for additional lists. We will respond to appropriate requests within 60 days.
Right to Request Restrictions: You have the right to restrict the use of your medical information for the purpose of payment, treatment and operations. You may object to any other uses included in this notice, such as fundraising. You have the right to request restrictions on the medical information we disclose about you for the purpose of notification to relatives, or other persons identified by you as involved in your care. You also have the right to request restrictions on the medical information we disclose about you to someone who is involved in your care or the payment for your care, such as a friend or family member. If admitted as an inpatient, you have the right to not be included in the hospital patient directory, which is used to direct calls and visits. Although we are not required to comply with such a request, we will attempt to do so.
Such requests must be in writing to the medical records department of the TUHS facility, which is providing the service. Such requests must clarify what information is not to be released and to whom you wish the restriction to apply.
Please note that you have the right to restrict the release of information to be used for payment or health care operations that pertains to a health care item or service for which you have paid out of pocket in full.
We are required to comply with such a request.
Right to Request Confidential Communications: You have the right to request that we communicate with you about certain medical matters in a certain manner or at a particular address. For example, you might request that we only contact you at work or by mail. Such a request must be in writing and must be specific. All reasonable requests will be honored.
Right to Notification of a Security Breach: You have the right to receive notification of a security breach as defined by the HIPAA Security rule. We will notify you in writing within 60 days of making a determination that a breach has occurred.
COMPLAINTS
If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, we encourage you to file a complaint with the facility Privacy Officer, or you may choose to direct your complaint to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
You may also file a complaint regarding the Breach Notification process with the facility Privacy Officer or the Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer.

En vigor a partir del 1 de Febrero de 2020
LAS PRÁCTICAS DE PRIVACIDAD DE TUHS SE APLICAN A:

Todos los empleados, el personal y otros miembros de:
Temple University Hospital, Inc.

Temple Physicians, Inc.
Temple Health System Transport Team, Inc.

PRÁCTICAS DE TUHS CON RESPECTO AL USO Y DIVULGACIÓN DE LA INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA:
TUHS
comprende
que
cierta
información
médica
acerca
de
usted
y
su salud es personal y nos comprometemos a proteger dicha información. Creamos un expediente para la atención médica y los servicios que usted recibe como paciente. Este expediente es necesario a fin de proporcionarle atención de calidad, documentar la prestación de servicios médicos pertinentes y procurar el reembolso de dichos servicios. Nuestras prácticas de privacidad se aplican a todos los expedientes de atención médica que hayan sido generados, o utilizados, por nuestros profesionales de atención médica a fin de brindarle servicios de atención médica.
La finalidad de este aviso es informarle de las maneras en que su información médica protegida podría ser utilizada o divulgada. Describe, además, sus derechos y otras obligaciones que tenemos con respecto al uso y divulgación de su información médica protegida.
LA LEY EXIGE QUE TUHS:
se asegure de que se mantenga la privacidad de la información médica confidencial;
le proporcione este Aviso sobre nuestras obligaciones legales y prácticas de privacidad respecto a su información médica;
le notifique si hemos determinado que la seguridad de su información protegida de atención médica está comprometida a causa de una infracción.
cumpla con las condiciones del Aviso que se encuentran actualmente en vigencia.
Nos reservamos el derecho de cambiar nuestras prácticas de privacidad periódicamente de conformidad con la ley. Al momento de brindarle el servicio se le suministrará el Aviso que se encuentre entonces vigente; asimismo, este aviso está disponible a solicitud y se encuentra publicado de manera visible en un área pública.
CÓMO TUHS PUEDE UTILIZAR Y DIVULGAR SU INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA:
PARA TRATAMIENTO - Su información médica podría ser utilizada para brindarle tratamiento y servicios adecuados. Los médicos, profesionales de enfermería, técnicos y otro personal de atención médica que participen en su cuidado pueden tener acceso a sus expedientes médicos. Podría ser necesario, además, que otro personal de TUHS sea informado únicamente de ciertos datos referidos a su tratamiento médico a fin de brindarle la atención adecuada. Por ejemplo, un médico que esté tratando una fractura de pierna necesitará saber si el paciente es diabético, o el médico podría necesitar informar de la diabetes de un paciente al especialista en nutrición del hospital para que se le suministren comidas adecuadas. Diferentes departamentos dentro de TUHS también podrían necesitar intercambiar información médica personal a fin de coordinar servicios particulares, tales como las radiografías, los análisis de laboratorio o las recetas. Asimismo, la información médica se puede divulgar para disponer atención médica adecuada después del alta.
PARA EL PAGO - La información médica confidencial también puede divulgarse para que el tratamiento y los servicios recibidos puedan ser facturados a una compañía de seguros o un tercero responsable del pago, como Medicare. Por ejemplo, se puede divulgar información médica protegida a la compañía de seguros del paciente a fin de facilitar el reembolso. Ciertas compañías de seguros requieren que se realice esta divulgación antes del inicio del tratamiento para determinar el alcance de la cobertura
PARA OPERACIONES RELACIONADAS CON LA ATENCIÓN MÉDICA - Se podría divulgar información médica confidencial para garantizar que TUHS proporciona servicios de calidad. Por ejemplo, se puede utilizar la información médica para evaluar el desempeño del personal o para capacitarlo. Médicos, profesionales de enfermería, técnicos, estudiantes de medicina y otros miembros del personal de TUHS pueden utilizar su información médica con fines educativos. En tales situaciones, se procurará eliminar toda información que pueda permitir identificar al paciente.
FAMILIARES U OTRAS PERSONAS QUE PARTICIPAN EN EL CUIDADO - La información protegida de atención médica podría ser revelada a familiares o amigos. Los pacientes pueden limitar o restringir la divulgación de información a ciertas personas. Consulte la sección Derecho a solicitar restricciones del presente Aviso.
INTERCAMBIOS DE INFORMACIÓN DE SALUD
Un Intercambio de Información de Salud (Health Information Exchange, HIE)
es una forma de compartir su información médica de forma electrónica con sus proveedores de atención fuera de TUHS. El objetivo es facilitar el acceso a sus expedientes por parte de los proveedores a los fines de coordinar el tratamiento y la atención. Temple University Health System (TUHS) participa en varios
HIE. Actualmente participamos en los siguientes HIE: Jeanes Care Connect, EPIC y HealthShare Exchange of Southeastern Pennsylvania, Inc. En el futuro, podríamos participar en otros HIE. Los participantes en los HIE podrían incluir
a hospitales, médicos y planes de salud. TUHS vela por la protección de su información corroborando que estos HIE dispongan de medidas de seguridad para proteger la confidencialidad de su información. Además, los HIE deben
cumplir con las leyes federales que aplican requisitos específicos para proteger la privacidad y seguridad de su información.
Los HIE almacenan la información enviada por un hospital o un médico en relación con un paciente específico.
La información disponible podría incluir información actual y pasada sobre sus enfermedades, medicamentos, alergias a medicamentos, vacunas, resultados de procedimientos y análisis de laboratorio, plan de atención y datos demográficos. Esta información podría establecer
una vinculación con el SIDA/VIH, la dependencia del alcohol o las drogas y los problemas de salud reproductiva o psiquiátrica.
Si no desea que se compartan estos expedientes, es necesario que solicite su Exclusión de los Intercambios de Información de Salud.
Si bien se lo alienta a participar en los Intercambios de Información de Salud,
usted puede, si así lo prefiere, optar por no participar en los HIE. Este proceso se denomina solicitar la exclusión.
Puede continuar recibiendo atención en una filial de TUHS, pero los hospitales y médicos no afiliados a TUHS no podrán acceder a la información médica electrónica, incluso en casos de emergencia. Si desea solicitar su Exclusión de los Intercambios de Información de Salud, póngase en contacto con el Representante a cargo de temas de privacidad del centro donde recibe atención a fin de obtener un Formulario de Exclusión. Si cambia de opinión, puede cancelar su Exclusión completando el Formulario de Revocación de Exclusión. Procesar su solicitud podría demorar hasta cinco (5) días hábiles a partir de la fecha de recepción.
Encontrará la información de contacto del Representante a cargo de temas de privacidad al final de este Aviso.
SEGÚN LO EXIGE LA LEY - Se podría divulgar información médica confidencial según lo estipulan las leyes locales, estatales o federales. Esto puede incluir la notificación obligatoria a funcionarios de salud pública, la Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) y otros.
DONACIÓN DE ÓRGANOS Y TEJIDOS - Si usted es donante de órganos, se podría divulgar la información médica a organizaciones involucradas en la obtención de órganos, según sea necesario, a fin de posibilitar la donación y el trasplante de órganos y tejidos.
SERVICIOS Y BENEFICIOS RELACIONADOS CON SU SALUD - TUHS puede usar y divulgar información médica para informarle o recomendarle opciones o alternativas de tratamientos posibles que puedan resultar beneficiosos para usted o recordarle sus citas.
JUECES DE INSTRUCCIÓN, MÉDICOS FORENSES Y DIRECTORES DE FUNERARIAS - La información médica confidencial podría ser divulgada a un juez de instrucción o médico forense para, por ejemplo, determinar la causa de una defunción o identificar a una persona fallecida.
INFORMACIÓN SENSIBLE - Las leyes federales y estatales exigen protección adicional para la información médica sensible comprendida en las siguientes categorías: drogadicción y alcoholismo, salud mental, VIH/SIDA y pruebas genéticas. Por lo general, se le solicitará una autorización por escrito antes de divulgar este tipo de información. No obstante, hay algunas circunstancias en las cuales la ley dispone que esta información se divulgue sin su consentimiento.
INVESTIGACIÓN - Una entidad cubierta podría usar o divulgar la información médica protegida para fines de investigación conforme a una autorización por parte de un Comité de Revisión Institucional [Institutional Review Board, ("IRB")]. El IRB es un comité organizacional que revisa y aprueba la investigación biomédica que involucra a sujetos humanos. La investigación que no reciba aprobación para una exención de consentimiento requerirá que usted emita una autorización por escrito antes de que su información protegida de atención médica pueda ser utilizada.
RECAUDACIÓN DE FONDOS - Podríamos utilizar y divulgar su información demográfica y las fechas en las que recibió tratamiento a fin de contactarlo para las actividades de recaudación de fondos que patrocinamos. En caso de que nos comuniquemos para recaudar fondos, usted tendrá la posibilidad de optar por ser excluido de futuros pedidos de colaboración.
OTROS USOS DE LA INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA PROTEGIDA
Otros usos de su información médica no comprendidos por este aviso se realizarán solo con su consentimiento por escrito. Por ejemplo, la mayoría de los usos y divulgaciones de las notas de psicoterapia y de la información protegida de atención médica para fines de marketing y venta de información protegida de atención médica requieren una autorización. Por lo común podríamos solicitar que nos autorice a utilizar su información médica con propósitos de investigación o a fin de responder a las consultas de los medios. Usted puede revocar esta autorización en cualquier momento.
SUS DERECHOS RELATIVOS A SU INFORMACIÓN MÉDICA.
Usted
tiene
los

con
respecto
a
la

Se aplicará un cargo correspondiente por realizar copias. En la mayoría de los casos, las solicitudes de examinar u obtener copia de un expediente recibirán respuesta en un plazo de 30 días, y pueden ser denegadas en circunstancias muy limitadas. Dicha decisión será examinada por el representante a cargo de temas de privacidad de la institución y, si fuera pertinente, por un profesional de atención médica matriculado no asociado con el rechazo de la solicitud. Existe la posibilidad de realizar una apelación de dicha decisión y se la puede solicitar mediante el envío por escrito de una solicitud de apelación al Representante a cargo de temas de privacidad y cumplimento corporativo de TUHS. Puede comunicarse con el Representante de privacidad y cumplimiento corporativo de TUHS al (215) 707-5605.

Dicha solicitud debe efectuarse por escrito y ser remitida al departamento de expedientes médicos del centro donde se prestó el servicio o al consultorio de su médico.
