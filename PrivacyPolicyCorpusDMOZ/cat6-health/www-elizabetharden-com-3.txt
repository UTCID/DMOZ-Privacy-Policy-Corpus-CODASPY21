We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information across all of our websites, mobile apps, and other online properties that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Sites, and covers only information collected in connection with your access to and use of the Sites. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy to learn about how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information and about the choices you can make regarding information you share. Revlon is the entity responsible for processing personal information (i.e., the data controller) under this Privacy Policy.
Because we are a global company, this Privacy Policy takes into consideration various privacy regulations and frameworks governing the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposition of personal information. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. In addition, while this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our personal information processing activities globally, the processing activities in some jurisdictions may be more limited based on restrictions under local laws or based on the products and services being offered.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
We ask that you read this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase our rights to use personal information we have previously collected about you, we will obtain your consent, where required by law, either through your registered email address or by prominent posting on this page.

By consenting to the use of cookies, you agree that we can store and access cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.
What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on and accessed from your device when you visit one of our Sites, to the extent that you consent. This allows our Sites to distinguish your device from those of other users of the Sites. You can find more information at www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu.
How do our Sites use cookies?
We may use cookies to identify you and your interests and to track your use of our Sites. We also may use cookies to control access to certain content of our Sites, protect the Sites, and to process any requests you make.
To administer our Sites and for research purposes, we may contract with third-party service providers to track and analyze statistical information about usage of, and volume of traffic on our Sites. These third-party service providers may use persistent cookies to help us improve the user experience, manage content on our Sites, and track user behavior.
We also may contract with third-party service providers to send emails to users who have provided us with their contact information. To help measure and improve the effectiveness of our email communications, the third-party service providers may drop cookies on users’ devices. All data that these third-party service providers collect on behalf of Revlon will be used solely by or on behalf of us and will be shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis.
We may use the following types of cookies for the described purposes:
Cookie Type
Purpose
Strictly Necessary/Technical
These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate our Sites so you can access the Sites as you have requested. These cookies, for example, let us recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that account to access Site content. They also include cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.
Analytical/Performance
These cookies are used by us or our business partners to analyze how our Sites are used and how they are performing. For example, these cookies track what pages are most frequently visited and from what locations our visitors arrive. If you subscribe to a newsletter or otherwise register with our Sites, these cookies may be correlated to you.
Functionality
These cookies let us operate our Sites in accordance with the choices you make. These cookies permit us to “remember” you between visits. For instance, we will recognize your user name and remember how you customized our Sites by, for example, adjusting text size, languages, fonts, and other parts of the Sites that are alterable, and provide you with the same customizations during future visits to the Sites.
Profiling, Targeting, and/or Advertising
your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from us as described below in the Your Rights section.
Third-Party Advertising
We may allow our business partners to use cookies on our Sites for the same purposes identified above, including collecting information about your online activities over time and across different websites. The business partners that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and may use their cookies to target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to our Sites.
How do I refuse or withdraw my consent to the use of cookies?
If you do not want cookies to be dropped on your device, you can adjust the setting of your internet browser to reject the setting of all or some cookies and to alert you when a cookie is placed on your device. For further information about how to do so, please refer to your browser ‘help,’ ‘tool,’ or ‘edit’ section or visit www.allaboutcookies.org. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be able to access or use all or part or certain functionalities of our Sites.
If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can manually delete them at any time. However, this will not prevent our Sites from placing cookies on your device in the future, unless and until you adjust your internet browser setting as described above.
For more information about the development of user profiles and the use of targeting/advertising cookies, please see www.youronlinechoices.eu if you are located in the European Union.
Your Choice to Provide Information
You can choose not to provide personal information to Revlon by refraining from, among other things, making purchases, using our services, applying for a job, and requesting information. You also may refrain from submitting information directly to us. However, if you do not provide personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide you with the full range of our products and services, or with information about our products, services, promotions, and other opportunities.
We reserve the right to store your personal information to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
Your Rights
You have certain rights regarding the personal information that we maintain about you, which in certain circumstances you will be able to exercise. These rights are as follows:
You may request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you. If we maintain your information based on your consent or so that we could enter into a contract with you, you can also request that we provide you a copy of your information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
If your information is incorrect, you may request that we correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.
You may request that we erase or restrict the processing of your personal information.
You may object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances when we process your data for the purposes of our legitimate interests.
Subject to applicable law, we will comply with your request as soon as practicable, and in any event, within not more than 1 month after receiving a valid request. If your request is particularly complicated, we may have to extend this period to 2 months. Any request to exercise these rights will be assessed in accordance with applicable law and there may be circumstances where we are not legally required to comply with your request. For example, we may reject requests that we determine are unreasonably repetitive or that risk the privacy of others. Access and correction requests may be done for free, unless they are repetitive, excessive or unfounded, in which case we may charge you the administrative costs we have incurred handling the request.
Some of these rights can be exercised online via your account. For example, you can review, modify, and delete certain information relating to your use of our Sites and unsubscribe to email, text, or other messages. If you are unable to manage your request via your online account then please contact us at privacypolicy@revlon.com.
Right to Opt Out of Marketing or Withdraw Consent
In addition, you may at any time tell us not to send you marketing communications by email by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link within the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting us as indicated below. We will apply your preferences going forward, subject to applicable law.
In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to Revlon’s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you will not be able to take advantage of certain Revlon products and services.
Complaints
If you are unhappy or have concerns about the way in which we have handled your personal information, please contact us (see “How You Can Contact Us”) so that we can try to resolve the issue.
