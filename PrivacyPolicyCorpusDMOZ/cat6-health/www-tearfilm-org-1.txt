INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF PERSONAL DATA
In accordance with the 2016/679 European Regulation
(This Policy was updated on May 23rd, 2018 in accordance to the regulations set by the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR)
Owner and Manager
The holder of the processing of personal data is the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society (TFOS), with registered office in Boston, MA, USA.
The Data Processor is Amy Gallant Sullivan, domiciled for this office at the TFOS headquarters, PO BOX 130146, located in Boston, MA, US, email address: privacy@tearfilm.org
Purpose of the treatment
Data is collected and kept for the fulfillment of tax obligations, for the management and organization of activities carried out by TFOS and for communications regarding institutional activities that we have planned and carried out.
In detail:
• the administrative management of the members
• information about initiatives, activities and projects carried out by or in collaboration with TFOS
TFOS collects personal data such as: name, surname, telephone, mobile phone, address, email, and other information provided voluntarily by the interested parties. To carry out tax obligations, TFOS may also collect tax data of the interested parties (tax code, place and date of birth).
TFOS guarantees that processing using electronic means is carried out by minimizing the use of personal and identification data, limiting the use of cases in which it is strictly necessary for the achievement of the purposes for which the data was collected.
Method of treatment
All activities concerning treatment of data are performed through traditional and electronic communication tools such as: emails, newsletters, phone calls, social networks.
The processing of data is carried out in compliance with current regulations, by means of paper and IT tools suitable to protect your security and confidentiality, in compliance with the measures set forth in the 2016/679 European Regulation, and relate to organizational, technical and logistical aspects.
This treatment consists of the collection, registration, organization, storage, consultation, processing, extraction, selection, comparison, use, cancellation and destruction of the data. The processing operations indicated above are carried out exclusively by TFOS in relation to the purposes for which the data was collected, through internal staff in charge of the various services related to the above.
The consent to the processing of data is optional, but in absence of this, the holder cannot manage requests regarding established institutional relationship (e.g. registration to events, subscription to the newsletter, etc.).
TFOS does not provide the aforementioned personal data to third parties for advertising purposes, does not sell them or lease them to third parties. In addition, it will not give, the personal data of its members to unauthorized third parties. The duration of the treatment is functional to the relationship with TFOS and to the administrative, accounting and organizational obligations. Data is in any case kept for a period of fifteen years for the purposes of traceability of the provided services and for internal administrative provisions and for the verification of related tax and compliance obligations.
Who treats the data
Personal data will be accessible to the TFOS organization, formally appointed as persons in charge.
The eventual forwarding to and use of personal data by external individuals and organizations acting on behalf of TFOS are governed by contracts that provide for an adequate level of protection of personal data. Users' personal data will only be used and released by TFOS exclusively to individuals and organizations working on their own behalf, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as expressly provided for by current legislation.
Specifically, data can be made available to third party suppliers, which carry out essential processing activities for the TFOS activity, some of which reside in foreign countries.
These third parties will act as autonomous data controllers, solely and exclusively to satisfy the request of the interested party (e.g. personal data communicated to third party suppliers for sending the newsletter, insertion in the database), or to which data communication is necessary to comply with the law or regulations (administrative obligations), or to organize and coordinate particular initiatives promoted by TFOS.
TFOS constantly monitors the activities commissioned to these third parties, verifying the work and reliability in terms of privacy.
With regard to the provision of data through our pages on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc ...), TFOS takes all measures in its possession to ensure secure treatment; these measures are however conditioned by the nature of the instrument itself, its usability by the user and the actions in terms of privacy undertaken directly by the owner of the social network.
TFOS cannot be held responsible for untruthful information sent directly by an interested party (e.g. personal data, postal addresses, email address), and which may possibly involve unaware third parties. Upon the occurrence of such incidents, TFOS will intervene promptly to protect the privacy of the interested parties involved, reserving the right to denounce such fraudulent actions to the competent authorities.
