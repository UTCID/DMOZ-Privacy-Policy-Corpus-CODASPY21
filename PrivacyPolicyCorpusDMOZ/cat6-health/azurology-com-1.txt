Please review this information prior to signing the acknowledgment form.No Show/Cancellation PolicyCentral Arizona Urologists is committed to providing the highest quality care to patients and we appreciate the privilege of providing your care.Medical resources are very limited and this includes appointment times to see the physician. When a person fails to show up for their scheduled appointment time or fails to give us adequate notice to either reschedule or cancel their appointment, this prevents us from providing care to our many other patients who are in need.In an effort to correct this problem, a fee of $100 is charged for all new patients who either “no show to their appointment” or do not call to cancel/reschedule within 48 business hours of their scheduled appointment. A fee of $30 is charged to all existing patients for the same. This charge is not billable to insurance and will be the patient’s responsibility to pay before another appointment will be scheduled.We regret having to take this action, but hope that this will improve access to all patients needing care from our urologists. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.patient portallog insign upIf new to our PORTAL please SIGN-UPContact Us
