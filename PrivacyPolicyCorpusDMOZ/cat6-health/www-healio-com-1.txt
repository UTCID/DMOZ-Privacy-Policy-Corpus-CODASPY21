Information That We Collect
In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the information we may collect about you in connection with your use of Healio. Please note, that in compliance with the General Data Regulation Policy ("GDPR"), if your IP address identifies you as being from the European Union (EU), we will ask you for your consent to collect this information. Additionally, in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), if you are identified as a visitor from the state of California, we will ask you for your consent to collect this information. This may be asked multiple times in the event that you access Healio on multiple devices (tablet, mobile) or erase your cookie history on any device. If you do not consent, your personal information will not be stored. You will still be able to browse the website, but your experience will not be personalized based on your browsing behavior and certain features of the site may not function as expected. Details of the information we may collect and how it will be utilized can be found below.
Registration. We may request personal information from visitors to our site who are interested in obtaining various products and services from us. This includes registering to become a user of Healio and automatically signing you up for potential e-mail correspondence. Personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact you. It includes but is not limited to: log-in credentials (user name, password), name, postal address, e-mail address, NPI number, year of medical school graduation, and telephone number.
We may also collect other types of information such as profession and professional interests as well as your communication preferences. We will store all personal information in a customer record until you instruct us to remove it from our databases. Registered users of the site are able to control their communication preferences at any time by accessing the "My Account" page.
We may combine information collected about you with information from third-party sources. For example, upon registration, some health care professionals will be matched against the publicly available NPI Registry to append and include their NPI number to their registration profiles.
In addition, this website participates in the Healthcare Communication NetworkSM (the "Network"), and as such has implemented various technologies for universal registration/log-in among all Network member websites. If you would like to understand how this website’s participation in the Network affects your privacy, please click here.
Please note that the Network registration/log-in system may be different from the registration/log-in used by this website for other products and services. To the extent that anything in this privacy policy conflicts with the policy for the Network technologies, the conflict will be resolved in favor of protecting our EU users’ personal information.
