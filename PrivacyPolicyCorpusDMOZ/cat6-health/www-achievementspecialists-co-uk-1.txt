For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature.

Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

•	Performance of Contract this means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
•	Legitimate Interest this means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by email info@achievementspecialists.co.uk.

process to follow in the event of a data breach. This approach is supported by on-going awareness and training programmes for Achievement Specialists staff to ensure the relevant security policies and protocols are observed.
