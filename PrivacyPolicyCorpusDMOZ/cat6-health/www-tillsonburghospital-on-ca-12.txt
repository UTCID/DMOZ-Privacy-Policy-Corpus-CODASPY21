Hospital Policies & Procedures
All Professional Staff members are governed by Professional Staff Bylaws and Professional Staff Rules and Regulations.
IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE YOURSELF AWARE OF HOSPITAL POLICIES.  We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the TDMH Professional Staff policies.
Policies that exist at a corporate or board level reflect the overall organization and affect everyone in the facility. Policies are also in place for specific departments or units.
Procedures are plans for action that give directions for daily operations. They are a natural outgrowth of policies, supplying the "how to" for the rule. Procedures are used to achieve uniformity of practice and facilitate training.
