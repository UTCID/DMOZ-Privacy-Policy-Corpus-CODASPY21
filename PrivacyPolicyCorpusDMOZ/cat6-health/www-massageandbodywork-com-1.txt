Each issue of our award-winning massage magazine  (included as part of ABMP membership, which includes professional liability insurance) offers in-depth articles on subjects important to the practicing professional and the layperson. The latest research, historical perspectives, massage techniques, business information, professional trends, and a variety of regularly featured columns keep Massage & Bodywork readers in touch with their work, their clients, and their health. Here’s what a few readers say:
“Massage & Bodywork is an invaluable tool for me on many aspects of our profession.”
