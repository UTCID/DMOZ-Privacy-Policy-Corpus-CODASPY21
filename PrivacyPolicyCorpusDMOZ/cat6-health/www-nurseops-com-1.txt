Privacy Policy
NurseOps is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our Website(s),
so we want you to know what information we collect when you visit one of our sites,
how we use that information, and how you can update it. By providing any information,
you agree to our use of that information consistent with this Policy. We reserve
the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please
re-visit this page occasionally to check for updates. .
Information We Collect
We collect various types of information from our visitors so we can adjust our site
to meet our users' needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected
automatically through cookies and other information is collected when you register
for any of our online services or when you request information from one of our partners.
Information Collected Automatically
The types of information your browser or Internet session automatically sends us
each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect, includes:
Your browser. Your computer's operating system. Your navigation path, i.e., the
URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where
you go as you leave. Your IP address. This and other information lets us see how
users are finding our sites, and it tells us which pages are visited the most often
so we can make our Websites more useful.
Information You Provide to Us
In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, Users have
the option of providing various types of personally identifiable Information to
us through the Site. For example, you may choose to provide us your personally identifiable
Information, including, but not limited to, your name, mailing address, telephone
number, email address, or age. We collect this information that you provide, and
may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating
contact forms with the information that you have provided. We provide this contact
information that you provide to the educational partner that you requested information
from. Customer interest information is collected to determine what information the
customer wishes to be sent.
How We Use This Information
We use the information we automatically collect to help us better plan our Website
to meet your Internet needs. Information you provide to us is used for marketing
purposes, and may result in follow-up communications. In addition, from time to
time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses)
about our customer base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer
goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our customers. All third
parties are bound by the federal CAN-SPAM Act and required to follow all consumer
opt out rules and regulations.
Your Rights Our Obligations
The company respects the privacy of users visiting our sites and will abide by all
applicable laws concerning the release of personal information. On an occasion we
may use certain directory information that we have collected to send you information
about products and services, or updates and other information we think may be of
interest to you. We may share this information with our educational partners to
bring similar information to your attention. If you tell us that you do not wish
to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect
your wishes. Please contact us to request your name and address be removed from
our lists. If you do not want to receive our e-mail marketing, please submit a request
to have your e-mail address removed by emailing: unsubscribe@NurseOps.com.
Legal Protections and Law Enforcement
We may disclose information about our users, including your personal information,
in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process
or other valid law enforcement measures; to comply with a legal obligation; at the
request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce
compliance with the policies governing the Sites and applicable laws; or to protect
the legal rights, interests, or safety of the Sites, our users or others. We may
also use device identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with
copyright owners, internet service providers or law enforcement agencies in our
discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
Our Security Measures
Our Websites have reasonable security measures in place to help protect personal
information under our control.
Why We Use "Cookies"
When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information.
This small piece of program code resides on your computer and stores your contact
information for all of our request information sites. We do this so you are not
required to re-enter your contact information as you move from one site to another.
In addition, some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once
we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement
covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
You can generally opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies
or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser
in the Options or Preferences menu. However, please be aware that some areas of
the Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled
the use of cookies.
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes Internet protocol
(IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer
the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
Clear Gifs
We and our third party advertising companies may employ a software technology called
clear gifs that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content
is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, and are used to discern the online movements of users. The
main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and
are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear
gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. Clear Gifs can
"work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same site or
advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com",
which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company
would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number,
to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would
then be given to the advertising company or site.
Links From Our Site To Other Sites
Some of our sites may contain links to other sites external to our sites. When you
access these external Websites, the providers of the sites will have access to certain
information about you. NurseOps is not responsible for the privacy practices or
the content of any Websites which we do not directly control.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement, the homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so our users are always
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances
we disclose it.

Definitions
Cookies
Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a
way for the Website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with
the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.
The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When
the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the
Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that
person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service
for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session. You can opt
out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before
accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or
Preferences menu.
IP (Internet Protocol) Address
This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and
server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a
permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session.
IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example,
204.171.64.2.
Browser Session
A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use.
The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you
reopen the browser, you begin a new session.
SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)
The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the
browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send
a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key
encryption during that session. We also use SSL encryption whenever we display your
personal information (e.g., name and address, scheduled courses, grades).
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate
between sites and pages within sites. The URL for NurseOps is www.NurseOps.com.
