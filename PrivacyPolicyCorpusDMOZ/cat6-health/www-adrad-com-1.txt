Advanced Radiology Consultants’ Notice Of Privacy Practices
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL/HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
Advanced Radiology Consultants is required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information and to provide you with this detailed Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices relating to this information. Advanced Radiology Consultants is required to abide, and shall abide, by the terms of the Notice that are currently in effect.
Advanced Radiology Consultants reserves the right to change the terms of this Notice and to make the new provisions effective for all personal health information received and maintained by us now and in the future. We will provide you with a copy of any revised Notice upon request on or after its effective date. In addition, copies of any revised Notice will be posted in our offices and will indicate the effective date.
I. USES AND DISCLOSURES FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS
As a patient of Advanced Radiology Consultants, information about you may be used and disclosed to other parties for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations, as described more fully below. These uses and disclosures do not require your authorization.
For Treatment. We will use and disclose your health information in providing you with diagnostic imaging services and coordinating your care and may disclose information to other providers involved in your care. Your health information may be used by our doctors and nurses, or disclosed to any other health care provider involved in your care, either within our practice or an outside healthcare provider or facility. For example, we disclose information about your health condition and examination results to a referring physician.
For Payment. We may use and disclose your health information for billing and payment purposes. We may disclose your health information to your representative, to another healthcare provider, or to an insurance or managed care company, Medicare, Medicaid or another third-party payor. For example, we may contact Medicare or your health plan to confirm your coverage or to request approval for services that will be provided to you.
For Health Care Operations. We may use or disclose your health information as necessary for Advanced Radiology Consultants’ health care operations, such as management, personnel evaluation, education and training and to monitor our quality of care. We may disclose your health information to other medical providers of yours for the same purposes or for health care fraud and abuse detection or compliance activities.  For example, health information of many patients may be combined and analyzed for purposes such as evaluating and improving quality of care and planning for services.
