International
The FTC engages with competition and consumer protection agencies in other countries, directly and through international networks, to halt deceptive and anticompetitive business practices that affect U.S. consumers. The FTC also reaches out to competition and consumer protection authorities to provide policy leadership, promote sound approaches to common problems, and help new agencies address the challenges of transitioning to a market-based economy.The FTC’s Office of International Affairs directs the agency’s international activities for competition and consumer protection, which include:strengthening relationships with foreign competition and consumer protection agenciesdeveloping formal and informal arrangements and agreements with competition and consumer protection agencies around the worldengaging in cooperative dialogues and submitting reports at international forums for competition and consumer protectionhelping agencies around the world develop and enhance their own competition and consumer protection programssharing information with foreign law enforcement authorities through the U.S. Safe Web Actmaintaining a robust International Fellows ProgramThe FTC also supports econsumer.gov, a project sponsored by the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network ICPEN and consumer agencies in more than 35 countries. Consumers can use econsumer.gov to report cross-border complaints. Enforcement agencies can use those complaints to investigate fraud.The Office of International Affairs publishes the FTC International Monthly newsletter, summarizing FTC activities of likely interest to international readers.
