Publication of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany
There are two different, unaffiliated companies that use the name MERCK. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which operates this website, uses the firm name "Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany," in the United States and Canada, and also uses "EMD Serono" in healthcare, "MilliporeSigma" in life science and "EMD Performance Materials" in the performance materials business. The other company, Merck & Co., Inc. holds the rights in the trademark MERCK in the United States and Canada. Merck & Co. is not affiliated with or related to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which owns the MERCK trademark in all other countries of the world. To reflect such fact and to avoid any confusion, certain logos, terms and business description of the publication on this website have been substituted or modified, such as by referring to "Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany" instead of "Merck" standing alone. Publications on this webpage, therefore, slightly deviate from the otherwise identical versions accessible outside the United States and Canada.
Accommodation for applicants with disabilities is available as part of the application and recruitment process. If you would like further information on accommodation, please contact HR at 855-444-5678.
