If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with any of the Insulite products please return your order and we will refund your original purchase price within 60 days from the purchase date (excluding shipping & handling). Please see below for how to return your products.
Auto Shipments
Stay on track with your supplements by choosing Auto-ship when ordering your products. If you need to update your auto-ship status (temporary hold or cancellation), please call 888-272-8250 during regular business hours. Feel free to leave a message; however, you must talk to a Customer Service Representative in order to provide certain information the company requires before your request can be processed. We will return your call within 1 business day.
Shipping Information
We ship orders Monday through Friday. In a typical situation, orders placed by 12 noon pacific time will ship the following business day. Weekend orders will ship on the next business day, which is generally the following Monday. Orders are shipped the best way for your address and should arrive within 3-5 working days. We will provide you with a tracking number so you can track your package directly to your door.
International Orders
Customs limitations preclude us from shipping to every international destination outside the United States. Customers are responsible for any additional customs fees.
Overnight shipping is not available to international addresses.
Delivery times vary between seven days to 14 days depending on the country and the customs procedures implemented by the country.
Please do not order items that cannot be imported into your country. Because laws vary from country to country, it is your responsibility to check with your Customs Offices to see if your country permits our products to be imported. The product ingredients can be found on our websites. Generally speaking, we have never encountered problems with Customs when shipping to most countries worldwide.
If the package is seized by Customs for any reason and returned to us, we will issue you a refund, less the shipping and handling costs. If it is not returned to us, we cannot issue you a refund. The majority of orders held by Customs are for the purpose of charging import duties and Customs fees. If you are unsure whether our products are allowed into your country, please contact your Customs Office before ordering.
Prepayment is required. Payment must be by credit card or money order.
Undeliverable Packages
Packages returned as “undeliverable” cannot be re-shipped. You can re-order the Insulite System again. Returned orders will be credited less shipping and handling.
Hours of Operation
Our corporate and shipping offices are open from 9am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday (Eastern time) and are closed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Our corporate and shipping offices are closed on all U.S. Government-observed holidays.
Refunds & Returns
Cancelling Your Order
Once payment has been accepted,  your order is released to fulfillment immediately and can not be canceled before shipping. If you wish  to cancel your order, refuse the package or return it to our Fulfillment Center in order to receive a full refund (see return instructions below).
When the package is returned a refund will be issued, excluding any applicable shipping and handling charges. Refunds will be issued within 10 business days after receipt of the returned product. We reserve the right to cancel any order at any time.
How to Return Your Products
To receive full credit for your order you must request a refund and a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number and all bottles, empty and unused must be received by our fulfillment center within 60 days of date of purchase.
To request a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number, please email support@insulitehealth.com or call 888-272-8250. Have your order # ready if possible. The RMA number must be displayed on the outside of the box. Packages sent to us without a RMA number may not be considered for a refund. We do not refund return shipping cost to our Fulfillment Center.
Return all empty and unused bottles (with RMA number). We’ll give you the return address when you contact us.
We strongly recommended that you return your package to us using a certified method that will provide a Tracking Number. If we do not receive the System and the customer cannot prove the product was returned, we will not issue a refund. The delivery confirmation number or our receipt signature will be proof of delivery as required by your carrier of choice.
Returns will be processed and refunds issued within 10 business days after receipt of the returned product. Refunds will be issued in the same manner as the original purchase payment method. If this payment method is not available for any reason, we will issue payment via PayPal unless otherwise instructed.
