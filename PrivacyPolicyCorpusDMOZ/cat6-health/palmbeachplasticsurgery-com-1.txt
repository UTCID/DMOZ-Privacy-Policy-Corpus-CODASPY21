Real Patients, Real Reviews
Absolutely with no reserve the best experience I have ever had at at Doctors office. Dr. Barr is the most charming man EVER!!!!!! He is an awesome surgeon and did my mini face lift with love and humor, I cant even say what a fantastic job that he did with no pain, the results are what I have been dreaming of!!!! He did the whole thing with Lidocaine injections and I did not feel a thing!!!! The office staff, Pam, LaDonna, Penny, Carla and Dr. Barr’s awesome Nurse Candy made me feel like I was their best friends, Would I go there again, I definitely plan to and I would never go to another Surgeon, I love them all and thank them for their concern and kindness!!!!!!

Dr. Barr and his staff are extremely pleasant and professional. The office setting is comfortable and everyone is helpful and informative. Dr. Barr is very gracious and skilled and he listens to his patients in a truly caring manner. I highly recommend this group if you want personalized and proficient care.

I believe that every patient want their doctor to be a genius. Dr Barr truly is a genius. He creates results that are natural and beautifully suited to the patient. In addition to his technical and creative talents, he is also a warm and compassionate individual who treats the patient with patience and kindness and who strives to tailor each treatment to the specific patient. I am thankful to the friend who recommended Dr Barr and to Dr Barr for giving me back my youth.
