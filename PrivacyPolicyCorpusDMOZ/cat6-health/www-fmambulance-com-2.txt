Privacy Policy
At F-M Ambulance, we vow to keep any information that we collect via our web site confidential. This includes your name, address, email address and other information that you disclose. The data you provide us is used to process the services in which you have requested and is only accessed by authorized personnel. We will notify you whether the information you are providing is being submitted through a secure or unsecured site. (When you come across a web page that is secured, your browser will likely display a "closed lock" or other symbol to inform you that SSL has been enabled. The web address should also now start with "https://" rather than "http://". In a nutshell, SSL allows a secure connection between your web browser and a web server. This secure information "tunnel" is being widely adopted by numerous companies for client services, from credit card purchases to online banking transactions.) Sending an email directly to an email address that is found on our web site is not considered secure. We have identified areas of the web site that are secure and encourage you to only submit highly sensitive and/or personal information through those sites.
The information that is gathered through our web site is not shared with any entities outside of F-M Ambulance, unless you have specifically authorized us to share that information or, in F-M Ambulance’s good-faith belief, it is required under the law. Please note that additional web sites are linked through our web site as a convenience for our users. F-M Ambulance is not responsible for the privacy practices on other sites and when you leave our web site, we encourage you to be aware and read the privacy statements of those sites to ensure your privacy and confidentiality. By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by F-M Ambulance as detailed in our Privacy Statement. If we ever make changes to our Privacy Statement, we will post any changes on this page so that you are constantly aware of the information we collect and the ways in which we use it. F-M Ambulance may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable the Site to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to the Site. The site may also collect your IP address, which does not contain Personal Information. The IP addresses will be used to monitor site usage statistics.
