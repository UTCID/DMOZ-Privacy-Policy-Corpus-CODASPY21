2. Community Guidelines
2.1. Generally
In order to create the best possible experience for everyone, we ask that you abide by the Epilepsy.com Community Guidelines ("Community Guidelines") in all of your activities on epilepsy.com. Violations of the Community Guidelines can lead to actions ranging from a warning to suspension or outright termination from the community group or the Site. The content posted in any section of the Community (forums, article comments, chat rooms, groups posts) does not represent the views or opinions of the Epilepsy Foundation.
2.2. Audience
The community is for people with connections or concerns related to epilepsy and seizures. Users must not generate more than one username without permission from the webmaster or community manager. If more than one person uses the same computer, they should each request individual usernames.
2.3. Conversations
As with most websites, conversations in the general forums and chat room are open to the public and may be monitored; do not expect privacy. Content in closed groups are not open to the public. Content may be reviewed by the Epilepsy Foundation as part of group activities and quality improvement. If you object to content posted in the Community, please notify the Foundation via ContactUs@efa.org. Once brought to the attention of the Epilepsy Foundation, we will take all appropriate action to remove or edit postings. Also, some community members may plan in-person meetings. The Foundation does not sponsor nor endorse any of these meetings and your participation in them is at your own risk. The Epilepsy Foundation does not take responsibility or control of these types of meetings and disclaims any liability for any damages or consequences associated with them.
2.4. Community Forums, Chats, Closed Groups, and Social Media Disclaimer
The community forums, chat rooms, closed groups, comments on articles, and social media sharing are provided as a free service of the Epilepsy Foundation. The community forums, group and chat rooms are created by the Epilepsy Foundation; however, posts within the forums and chat rooms are created by individual users. The Epilepsy Foundation does not provide 24/7 monitoring of the community features. Forum posts may be reviewed periodically. Inappropriate posts may be removed or managed according to the terms of use. Transcripts of chat rooms may be reviewed periodically.
2.5. Rules and Behavior for Groups and Forums
Users of open community forums and chat rooms must be 13 years or over. (see How are children who use the Foundation's website protected?). Users of the Kids Crew closed group may be younger (see group eligibility) with permission and supervision of parent/guardian.
Users must not generate more than one username without express permission from the webmaster or community manager.
Use common sense — do not share phone numbers or emails unless you know who you are talking to. (see How does the Foundation protect my confidential information?)
Content that does not follow the community guidelines can be removed. Violators of the Community Guidelines may receive warnings. They may also be temporarily or permanently banned for a community group. (see Where should I go if I have a question or a complaint about the Foundation's privacy policy and practices?)
Please do NOT use emoticons, icons, text or any items in the groups that move a lot or cause flashing patterns.
Avoid bright or neon colors in text or images.
Text size can be enlarged to enhance visibility by using the zoom feature on a computer or device.
Respect Others. Be polite and considerate. Please don't ask probing personal questions or share information about another member. Talk about yourself and your experiences rather than other people.
Do not give medical advice to another member.
Do not harass, abuse or threaten another member. If you disagree with someone, respond to the subject, not the person. Do not threaten harm to yourself. These actions may result in a temporary ban or termination of your account from a community group and/or the Site.
Do not use hate speech. Hate speech is unacceptable, and the Epilepsy Foundation reserves the right to take appropriate action against any account using the service to post, transmit, promote, distribute or facilitate distribution of content intended to victimize, harass, degrade or intimidate an individual or group on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.
Do not impersonate any person, business or other entity. Doing so in an attempt to deceive, harass, or otherwise mislead another user and is forbidden. You may not pretend to be an employee or representative of Epilepsy.com, the Epilepsy Foundation or the Epilepsy Therapy Project.
Do not use the Site to buy, sell or advertise commercial products.
Know and Abide By Our Laws. It is your responsibility to know and abide by the law. If you fail to do so, the Epilepsy Foundation reserves the right to take any action it deems warranted. You may not publish, post, transmit, promote, or distribute material (including software, photos, sounds and written material) that is illegal or incites illegal activity, or use the Site to conduct illegal activities. We terminate accounts and cooperate with law enforcement on such matters.
3. Content and Materials on the Site
3.1. Epilepsy Foundation Content
The Site may include or provide access to information, software, photos, videos, text, graphics, music, sounds, and other material or information provided by us or third parties (collectively, the "Epilepsy Foundation Content") that are protected by copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property laws. You understand and agree that these rights in any Epilepsy Foundation Content are valid and protected in all forms, media, and technologies existing now or developed in the future. You may not obscure or remove any proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Epilepsy Foundation Content.
3.2. User Content

By submitting User Content to the Site, you grant Epilepsy Foundation a nonexclusive, worldwide, right and license to use, copy, and display User Content to provide the Site.
