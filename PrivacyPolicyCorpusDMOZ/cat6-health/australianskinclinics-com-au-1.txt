Privacy Policy
We respect the privacy of individuals who visit our website, our head office and our clinics. This Privacy Policy outlines the information that we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information and who we share it with, so that you can decide whether and how you wish to provide information to us. In adopting this Privacy Policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information obtained through this website with your reasonable expectations of privacy. We also adhere to a strict Medical Confidentiality Policy – a copy of which is available in the clinic or at head office.
We take your rights seriously and so this Privacy Policy is your assurance that we never take your privacy for granted and always take the utmost care in protecting your personal information.
In this Policy, the term “ASC Group” refers to ASC Master Franchise Pty Ltd ACN 153 138 268 and its related entities and its franchisees.
What information do we collect?
Personally identifiable information is collected when users voluntarily provide information to:
australianskinclinics.com.au, for example in registering for e-mail communications or other services;

when making enquiries about franchising opportunities.
Personal information may also be collected when other health practitioners provide personal information to us.  During these activities, we may request information such as your name, e-mail address, residence address, phone number, date of birth, Medicare number, healthcare provider details, subscriber status, and credit card number (when purchasing products or services). We may also ask you for other information at other times.
What additional information is collected about our customer?
In addition to the above information, we may take before and after photographs of you, write file notes about your skin, your treatment, medical conditions and your leisure activities.  For example, a customer who is frequently exposed to the sun may require extra care when managing their skin.
What additional information is collected about our franchisees or potential franchisees?
We may also collect information about your current employment including your position, period of employment, experience and the amount you are looking to invest.
Why do we collect personal information?

We also provide your personal information to other entities in the Group and they may disclose or use your personal information for the purposes described in “Why do we collect personal information?” in relation to products and services that they may provide to you.
