Policy Zone
Welcome to the Keele University Policy Zone where you will find all University policy documents sorted by A-Z, Theme, Document Type and Owner.   The University Policy Framework available below ensures the University has consistent standards for the development, approval, publication, communication and review of its governance documentation; it defines the categories of policy documents and outlines the hierarchy of such documents.
