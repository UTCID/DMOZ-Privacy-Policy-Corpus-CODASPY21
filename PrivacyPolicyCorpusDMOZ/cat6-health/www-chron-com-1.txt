If you made a New Year’s resolution, there’s a good chance you’ve already blown it.
Up the ante by considering options besides putting a lock on the fridge or having a friend drag you out of bed for early morning workouts.
“Hypnosis,” said Chris Pennell of Spirit Quest Healing. “It’s about getting the subconscious to look at things differently.”
While hypnosis has its skeptics, it has believers as well. Pennell said hypnosis can treat smoking, weight control, phobias, procrastination, anxiety, self-forgiveness, guilt, anger issues and insomnia.
“People have all kinds of issues,” Pennell said.
Stress management is a big one.
“Most people, about 99 percent, even though they think they know what is bothering them, they really don’t,” Pennell said. “It’s actually some subconscious thought that’s causing them to be stressed.”
Pennell, using a soothing voice and deep relaxation skills, takes clients back to the “seed” to get their subconscious to release a negative trigger and replace it with a positive one.
“I use the color green,” Pennell said. “We put a positive trigger of the color green in your subconscious, and when you feel stressed, you look at the color green and become more calm, relaxed, and think more clearly.”

“You’re in a place where no one can touch you because you’re the only one there,” said Katy resident Karon Tracy, 61, who used hypnosis for stress relief after battling cancer.
Ira Chorush used hypnosis to help quit a three-pack-a-day habit. He said a nicotine patch cut his smoking in half, but a skin rash and vivid dreams bothered him.
Chorush visited hypnotherapist Joshua Syna at the Transformation and Empowerment Center in Houston more than 10 years ago and quit smoking after a single, two-hour session.
“I have read that under hypnosis a person could have an operation without having anesthesia,” he said. “I don’t know about that, but there’s no question it’s a very powerful tool.”
