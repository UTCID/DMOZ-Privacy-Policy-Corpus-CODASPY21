You may visit this site without providing us with any personally identifiable information. You may choose to submit personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, such as when you join the mailing lists for Pathways.org newsletters and other mailings; purchase an item online from Pathways.org; make an online contribution to Pathways.org; or register for access to certain pages on this site. In these instances, we may ask you to provide information, including your name, address, and other similar contact information.

Use of Personal Information
We may provide your personally identifiable information to contracted vendors that assist Pathways.org with mailings and online sales transactions.
Pathways.org does not sell or otherwise share with organizations who are not our partners any of the personally identifiable information received on this site. Pathways.org may use personally identifiable information for Pathways.org-specific direct mailings, such as email updates, newsletters, and solicitation and advocacy letters, and we may share your information with organizations and companies that partner with us to provide information, products, and services that we believe are of real value to the community we serve. If you do not wish for us to share your information with our partners, please let us know by contacting us at the email address below, and we will gladly respect your decision to “opt-out” of receiving communications from Pathways.org and/or its partners.
