This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Site.
USE OF COOKIES and web beacons
The Site uses “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Site pages, or register with the Site or services provided through the Site, a cookie helps the Site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Site features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Site services or websites you visit.
The Site and e-mails we may send you may also use web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images which can be used to deliver cookies, count visits, or tell if an e-mail has been opened or acted upon.
SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We will use reasonable efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure and to secure the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and ANTECH, and other users and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties or accidental loss or damage. Therefore, your use of the Site and the services, and your disclosure to us of any personally identifiable information, is at your own risk. However, once we receive a transmission from you, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure the security of your information in our operations.
If we learn of a security breach through which sensitive personal information may have been compromised, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice on our Web site if a security breach occurs. By using this Web site, or providing personal information to us through any means, you expressly agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this Web site and our services.
Opt-out FROM RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS AND from distribution lists
You may “opt-out” of receiving communications via postal mail, e-mail, text (SMS, MMS), phone and other communication methods. In order to opt out of receiving these communications, you should follow the “unsubscribe” or “manage email preferences” instructions contained in any communication you receive or send us an email request to: unsubscribe@antechdiagnostics.com, and include “Opt-Out” in the subject box and include your name and email address in the text box.
