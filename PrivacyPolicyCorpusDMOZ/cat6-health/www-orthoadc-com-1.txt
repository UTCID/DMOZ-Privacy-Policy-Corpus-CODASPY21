No show/Cancellation Policy
Orthopedic Associates of Dutchess County is dedicated to providing the highest quality care to patients and want to thank you for the privilege of providing your care.Over the past few years, we are seeing an increase in the number of patients who fail to show up for their scheduled appointment or fail to call the office to cancel their scheduled appointment within a reasonable time frame. Every scheduled appointment that is missed jeopardizes the patient/physician relationship and prevents us from providing care to other patients in need.In an effort to correct this problem, effective February 18, 2009, Orthopedic Associates of Dutchess County is instituting an updated policy in which we reserve the right to discharge a patient after three "no show" appointments
