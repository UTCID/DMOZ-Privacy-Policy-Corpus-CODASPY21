PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY USING THIS WEB SITE, YOU AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ANY AMENDMENTS THERETO, AND AGREE THAT
YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE AND ELIGIBLE TO USE THIS SITE.
Welcome to the Cardio Yoga site (the "Site"), provided by Savvier LP
(individually and collectively, the "Company"). These Terms of Use and any
amendments thereto (the "Terms") govern your use of this Site and its related
domains on which this document appears. The Terms may be changed in the future
without further notice by posting an updated version at the Site. Your
continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your express
acceptance of the new Terms. These Terms apply exclusively to your access to,
and use of, the Site and do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of
any other agreement you may have with the Company for products, services, or
otherwise.
Use of the Site
The Site is designed to be used by both certified Cardio Yoga instructors
("Certified Instructors"), those participating in a Cardio Yoga workout (a
"Workout Participant"), and third party administrative personnel associated
with one or more of the Certified Instructors ("Administrator"). The
information and services offered on this Site are provided solely for general
information, and are not intended to (a) replace any advice or counsel from
licensed or certified professionals; (b) constitute medical advice or apply
specifically for any individual's unique needs and situation; and (c)
diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure or prevent any disease or health-related
condition. Only Certified Instructors in good standing, their Administrators,
and/or Workout Participants that are enrolled or have completed a Cardio Yoga
class from a Certified Instructor may access and use the Site.
By Certified Instructors: Certified Instructors may access the general
public sections of the Site without charge, and may access the instructor
membership sections so long as they remain in good standing once certified.
To remain in good standing and current in the teaching methods, a Certified
Instructor must a) actively be teaching Cardio Yoga classes, b) maintain
compliance with the terms of the Certified Instructor agreement and c)
comply with the Terms and Conditions herein . Additionally, Certified
Instructors in good standing may have access to the paid portions of the
membership sections which provide ongoing choreography content and tools
provided the instructor is enrolled in the Monthly Choreography Membership
as described further herein. Certified Instructors accessing the
choreography sections shall be charged $9.99 per month for access to the
Site, and continuing every 30 days thereafter, and shall be automatically
charged the $9.99 per month, unless and until they notify the Company to
cancel/discontinue their membership. Notification to cancel/discontinue
membership can be done at any time through the user’s account profile page,
or by phone by calling 1-800-464-7309 (during normal business hours as
posted on the contact page of this Site), or by email to
customerservice@cardioyoga.com. Notifications to cancel your membership must
be done prior to the auto-renewal date for a new month in order to avoid
being charged for the new month. No refunds shall be provided for
notifications received after the auto-renewal date, however once the Company
receives cancellation notification, then the membership shall continue
through the completion of any paid month, and then terminate upon the next
auto-renewal date. The auto-renewal date is the anniversary day of the month
commensurating on the Start Date (i.e. if the Start Date is April 16, then
the next auto-renewal date is the 16th of the applicable month). In the
event a Certified Instructor cancels/discontinues their membership, and then
subsequently re-enrolls in choreograph membership, then the returning
Certified Instructor’s Start Date will be defined as the start date of the
new membership enrollment date (as applicable)..
By Workout Participants: Workout Participants may access the general
public sections of the Site without charge, but may not access the
instructor membership sections.
Administrators are provided access to the site by either a) completing the
new corporation administrator form located on the Site and receiving Company
approval or by receiving administrative access within a previously approved
corporation where such access was granted consistent with the Site’s
corporate administrator rules. Administrators only have authorization to
view information within their corporation (i.e. information accessible by
Certified Instructors employed or contracted with their corporation) and to
manage the Instructors holding Cardio Yoga classes for their respective
corporation, but Administrators cannot access paid membership sections
unless they are Certified Instructors.

refer to the Site’s Privacy Policy for information about how the Company
collects and uses personally identifiable and aggregated information. The
access provided to Certified Instructors shall not include access to the
credit card information that another Instructor or Workout Participant
provides to the Company, and/or their Address, unless otherwise provided
directly by such person to the Certified Trainer. Administrators affiliated
with your Certified Instructors will also have access to the same information
as your Certified Instructors. Please remember, neither Certified Trainers nor
Administrators are employees or agents of the Company. Without limitation of
any other provisions stated in the Privacy Policy, you agree that the Company

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
You and Company agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a
transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and
that any dispute between us, including disputes against any agent or affiliate
will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration and the
arbitration decision may be enforced and judgment entered thereon in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
By agreeing to this arbitration AGREEMENT, you are giving up your
right to go to court, including your right to a jury trial . In
arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal,
however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The
arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
("AAA"), and conducted under AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA
Rules") then in effect at the time of the dispute. You may obtain
copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating an
arbitration by visiting the AAA website at
www.adr.org
, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879 .If you initiate an
arbitration, the Company will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing
fee which may have been required under AAA’s Procedures once you have notified
Company in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. The
prevailing party in the arbitration may be awarded attorneys’ fees, costs and
reimbursement of filing fees. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the
parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum.
There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a
class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim
submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private
attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative
or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim
submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person’s claims against the Company and may not preside over any kind of
representative or class proceeding against the Company. You acknowledge that
this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any
disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to
arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited,
voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall
be null and void. You understand that by agreeing to this class action waiver,
you may only bring claims against COMPANY in an individual capacity and not as
a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative
proceeding. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS, YOU MUST TELL US IN
WRITING AND IMMEDIATELY CEASE USING ALL OF THE COMPANY’S SERVICES. IN THE
EVENT THAT YOU HAVE MADE A PAYMENT TO THE COMPANY PRIOR TO YOUR NOTIFICATION
TO THE COMPANY OF YOUR DISAGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS, AND SUCH PAYMENT AND
NOTIFICATION IS MADE WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS OF YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN
THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE A FULL REFUND TO YOU OF THOSE MONIES PAID TO USE THE
