AABB does not require a registration or any information to view the public portions of our website. Only members of AABB may visit the “Members Only” sections and content of the website.Each time a visitor comes to AABB’s website, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. At the AABB website, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from google.com or fda.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our site), and browser and platform type. Our website contains links to other websites; these are sites that may be maintained by organizations that are not affiliates of AABB.

Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor’s system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected using cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. AABB uses “cookie” technology primarily to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors to improve visitors’ online experience and facilitate their visit.
