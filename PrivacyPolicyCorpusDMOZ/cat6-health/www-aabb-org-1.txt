AABB does not require a registration or any information to view the public portions of our website. Only members of AABB may visit the Members Only sections and content of the website.Each time a visitor comes to AABBs website, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. At the AABB website, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from google.com or fda.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our site), and browser and platform type.
