Legal notices and policies
There has been increased awareness regarding human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502 is a manifestation of this awareness. Nuance is committed to the ethical sourcing of minerals used in our products. We have been actively assessing whether our products contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold derived from ores mined in the DRC and adjoining countries (Conflict Minerals).
It is Nuance's goal not to purchase product materials containing Conflict Minerals. The global supply chain for these minerals is complex, and tracing such Conflict Minerals in our products to their source is challenging. Nuance is working with our suppliers and other stakeholders to improve and systematically address the process for sourcing minerals that are "conflict-free."
Consistent with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we expect our suppliers (and their suppliers and sub-suppliers) to comply with the applicable regulation to prevent Conflict Minerals from entering our products and processes. To this end, Nuance is requiring all suppliers to:
Understand where Conflict Minerals can enter their process
Disclose the use of Conflict Minerals or certify that Conflict Minerals are not used in their materials or processes
Work to eliminate use of Conflict Minerals discovered through these efforts

Software piracy
Each copy of Dragon is licensed for use by a single user. When you purchase a genuine copy of Dragon, you become a licensed user and have purchased the right to use the software for a specific user. It is against the law to give copies to friends and colleagues or to sell copies of the software to others. The unauthorized copying of software is called piracy.
Each copy of Dragon must be activated prior to use. This helps us to discourage the piracy of our software and protects our customers from the risks of illegal and fake software. In addition to potential viruses, pirated software does not offer the support, warranties and updates received with genuine copies of Dragon. Unfortunately, this process doesn't stop all software piracy. Some people continue to sell fake or illegal copies of Dragon, particularly through Internet storefronts or online auction sites.
Since there are many legitimate online retailers of Dragon, it may be difficult to spot online piracy. Before buying online, be sure to review the company's name, full address and phone number. Inquire about the company's return policy, as well as service and warranty information. Ask directly if the software has been used or installed before. To be sure that you are purchasing a genuine copy of Dragon, we encourage you to buy your products either directly from Nuance or from one of our authorized resellers.
If you mistakenly purchased a pirated copy of Dragon, it is not supported by Nuance as we can’t confirm the quality and full functionality of pirated products. Although Nuance regularly monitors the market for pirated versions of our software to protect our customer base, we can’t be responsible for the activities of those who illegally copy the software. You will need to return the software to its original source.
