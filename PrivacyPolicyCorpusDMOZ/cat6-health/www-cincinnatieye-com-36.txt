Vitreous Hemorrhage
The vitreous is the gelatinous-like substance that makes up approximately two-thirds of the eye’s volume. The vitreous is located in between the lens, in the front of the eye, and the retina, in the back of the eye. In a normal, healthy vitreous, there are no blood vessels, yet diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, can lead to the development of new blood vessels which grow into the vitreous gel. These blood vessels are often fragile and susceptible to leaking blood and fluids.
Causes of a Vitreous Hemorrhage
A vitreous hemorrhage occurs when a blood vessels ruptures and causes bleeding within the vitreous gel, causing visual symptoms. There are various causes of a vitreous hemorrhage, including:
Diabetic retinopathy
Sickle cell retinopathy
Retinal vein occlusion
Retinopathy of prematurity
Ocular ischemic syndrome
Posterior vitreous detachment
Retinal detachment
Terson’s syndrome
Retinal macroaneurysms
Tumor
Leukemia
Nearsightedness
Carotid artery disease
Trauma
Choroidal neovascularization
Symptoms of a Vitreous Hemorrhage
Patients with vitreous hemorrhage usually notice the following symptoms:
A sudden, significant increase in the number and size of floaters blocking their vision
Vision loss
Blurry, cloudy or hazy vision
Flashes of light
When symptoms occur, it is important for patients to seek prompt medical attention.
Diagnosis of a Vitreous Hemorrhage
The doctor will examine the patient’s eyes as well as review their medical history to determine the cause of the hemorrhage. An appropriate treatment will be recommended. To confirm the diagnosis, a series of diagnostic tests may be performed such as:
Gonioscopy
IOP
B-scan
Dilated eye examination
Indirect ophthalmoscopy
Slit-lamp examination
Treatment of a Vitreous Hemorrhage
If a retinal detachment or break is diagnosed, a vitrectomy is performed immediately. Treatment for a vitreous hemorrhage will be determined based on the underlying cause of the condition. Some of the treatments for a vitreous hemorrhage include:
Vitrectomy
Cryotherapy
Laser photocoagulation
Intravitreal injections
