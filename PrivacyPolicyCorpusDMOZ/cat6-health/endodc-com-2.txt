As a convenience to you, the Sites may provide links to websites and access to content, products and services of third parties, including without limitation, AmSurg’s affiliates and strategic partners and other entities with which our connection consists of only a hyperlink (“Linked Sites”). All Linked Sites are provided only because they may be of interest to Site users. Information and views contained in Linked Sites are not adopted by AmSurg.
You should refer to the separate terms of use, privacy policies, and other rules posted on Linked Sites before you use them.

10. TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS
Our goal is to provide complete, accurate, up-to-date information on our Sites. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ensure that any website is completely free of human or technological errors. The Sites may contain typographical mistakes, inaccuracies, or omissions, and some information may not be complete or current. AmSurg therefore reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice.
11. NO INVESTMENT ADVICE; FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION
Nothing on the Sites constitutes investment advice. Any stock prices provided on the Sites are not official market quotations and are not to be considered a substitute for obtaining pricing information from official sources.
The Sites may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They typically use words such as or similar to “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe.”
Forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors may have a significant impact on actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about the performance of AmSurg’s stock or business. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
Please note that the Sites may provide access to historical or previously-posted materials. Typically such materials will be located in a distinct section of a Site, but please take note of the date provided in connection with materials accessed through the Sites. In addition, the Sites may from time to time includes summaries or synopses of relevant information. Whenever possible, AmSurg attempts to make clear that such information is not a complete analysis and provide reference to more comprehensive information or analysis.

Neither Site provides medical advice, diagnoses or recommendations about medical treatment, and neither recommends or endorses any products or information that may be contained in the Content for your particular circumstances.

AmSurg encourages you to consult your health care provider with any questions or concerns you may have regarding any medical condition. You expressly acknowledge and agree that AmSurg is not responsible for the results of your decisions made based on your use of the Sites or any Forum.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY, SOME OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
15. INDEMNITY
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold AmSurg, its affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, co-branders, subsidiaries, parents, employees and agents, harmless from any claim, demand, liability, dispute, damage, cost, expense, or loss, including attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation, arising out of or in any way related to your use of or access to a Site, your use of the Content (including any use by your employees), your violation of these Terms or your violation of any rights of another.
16. LIMITATION ON ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST AMSURG
You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of a Site or these Terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by AmSurg to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of a Site requires that such claim be resolved exclusively by confidential binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Intellectual Property Rights, AmSurg may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief. The arbitration shall be conducted before three neutral arbitrators in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as then in effect. No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. Except for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law.
BECAUSE THE USE OF THE SITES REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATORS’ DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party hereby consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee or to any Federal Court located within the State of Tennessee for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any such action by registered mail or any other means provided by law. Should this Section 17 be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, it shall be severed and the parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts in Nashville, Tennessee.
18. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
You acknowledge (a) that you have read and understood these Terms; and (b) that these Terms have the same force and effect as a signed agreement.
19. GENERAL
In the event that any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. AmSurg’s failure to act with respect to a breach by any visitor using the Site does not constitute a waiver of its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to its choice of law provisions. In the event of any conflict between foreign laws, rules and regulations and those of the United States, the laws, rules and regulations of the United States will govern. These Terms and the Privacy Policy as posted from time to time by AmSurg on the Sites, and any modifications to the foregoing, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter in these Terms and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, as to such subject matter.
