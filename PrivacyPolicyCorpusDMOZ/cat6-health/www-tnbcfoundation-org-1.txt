When users make Personal Information available to us, their Personal Information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Information offline). The collection of Personal Information, including Sensitive Information, is processed by and through a secure server. This means that Personal Information submitted via the Website or a web page hosted by one of our third party service providers is encrypted using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology before transmission. Further, on secure Website pages, including web pages hosted by our third party service providers, the web address in the address bar at the top of the browser screen starts with an “https” instead of an “http.” Web pages that are used for collecting TNBCF donations are verified by GeoTrust, and the donation transactions are processed using Blackbaud Payment Services, which is PCI Compliant.Access to your Personal Information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your Personal Information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store Personal Information in are kept in a secure physical environment.

Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your Personal Information, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your Personal Information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Website, or a web page hosted by one of our third party service providers, is at your own risk.All of our users’ Personal Information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or third party agents who need the Personal Information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all end-user Personal Information. Employees not adhering to our policies are subject to disciplinary action.UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE. TNBCF will comply with all federal and state laws relating to the security of Personal Information. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION: Personal information, including Sensitive Information, is shared among TNBCF staff and certain of our third party service providers (for example, our accountants) to process your donation(s) or contact you about the TNBCF Services and/or our ongoing work.Credit Card Transactions, Electronic Fund Transfers, Payments by Check or Money Order and On-line Transactions. TNBCF utilizes third party service providers to provide credit card, bank, payment and information processing services, to manage a donor database and to communicate with donors. If you choose to make a donation on-line, by phone, through the mail or by other means, the Personal Information provided will either be collected directly, or we will share that Personal Information with our contracted third party service providers. TNBCF requires that its third party service providers have in place privacy policies and practices consistent with this Privacy Policy; provided, however, that we cannot guarantee the privacy practices of our third party service providers.Corporate Restructuring. TNBCF may transfer your Personal Information to a third party successor in interest if we are involved in a transfer of control or sale of assets; provided, however, that if we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices that you may have regarding your Personal Information.Legal Necessity. TNBCF may be required by subpoena, law or governmental body to disclose your Personal Information; provided, however, that, where permitted by applicable law, we shall provide you with e-mail notice, and opportunity to challenge the subpoena or required disclosure, prior to disclosure of any Personal Information pursuant to same.Improper Activity. TNBCF may disclose your Personal Information in the event that we believe that the Website and/or TNBCF Services is/are being or has/have been used in violation of any TNBCF policies or to commit unlawful acts.NO SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR MARKETING PURPOSES: TNBCF does not rent, sell, trade or share Personal Information for marketing purposes with anyone or any other purpose other than as expressly specified in this Privacy Policy.COOKIES: When an end-user visits the Website, we send one (1) or more cookies and/or gif files (collectively, “Cookies”) to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the applicable end-user’s computer or other device.
