It is Tufts' policy to hold all personal information you supply in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy law.
Information Gathered About You or Your Devices
We collect information when you access one of the Services and when you subscribe to our email services.
Device Information
We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Services such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Services.
IP Address. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for several purposes, such as security, calculating usage levels, and diagnosing server problems. We also use your IP address to administer our Services by identifying (1) which parts of a Service are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.
Physical Location. We may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device's physical location with our service providers to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but if you do, we and/or our service providers may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
Use of Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your device and are used to collect and store information. This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from.
Types of Cookies. A session cookie is temporary, linking the actions of a user during any given browser session. When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted. A permanent cookie, also known as a persistent cookie, is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the cookie. A third-party cookie is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.
Why we use Cookies. We use session, permanent and third-party cookies for security purposes, to display information more effectively, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. Cookies further allow us to select which of our programs, initiatives, offerings and services are most likely to appeal to you and to display them while you are on the Services.
We may contract with selected third parties to place cookies through the Services to provide us with better insights into the use of the Services or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when they use our Services. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
Some third-party cookies may originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest or other social media services. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly.
Use of Technology to Track Users of Services
Google Analytics. One or more of our Services may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics uses cookies and other technologies to track visitor interactions and collects the IP address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from. This service may also collect demographic information and information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors or reporting IP addresses to us.
We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience. We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.
To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about its privacy practices, please see Google Privacy Policy, www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data. You can opt out of the services by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Pixel Tags. One or more of our Services may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, tags or clear GIFs) that embed graphic files in our Services. These graphic files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Services, or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them.
These small data files or graphic files serve a variety of functions. In some instances, they may be necessary to deliver a particular service. Even when they are not essential to the delivery of a service, they may provide information that enables us to improve the performance and functionality of our services and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. They may also enable us to customize our services and provide advertising messages that are more relevant to you and your interests.
Adobe Flash Technology. We may use Flash Local Shared Objects (Flash LSOs) and other similar technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.
Adjusting Cookie Settings
You can change your cookie settings by reviewing your internet browser's cookie options. Most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular website. The links below to popular browsers may help you understand your cookie options better. Typically, such information can be found under the browser's 'Help', 'Preferences' or 'Options' menus. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track request signals.

Blocking Cookies. Should you choose to decline or block cookies by adjusting your browser settings, including cookies essential to the Services, please note that all or parts of our Services may not be functional or accessible to you. Our Services will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Services, unless your browser cookie settings are adjusted to prevent such an occurrence.
Interest-Based Advertisements. Some of our Services engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you. Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising on the Services and on third-party platforms using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Services or visiting other websites, apps or online services that contain our content or ads. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like mobile identifiers, cookies, and pixel tags.
To learn more about interest-based ads or to opt-out of receiving interest based ads, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info, or www.youronlinechoices.eu, or Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. Google provides information on Blocking Certain Ads and on how to Control the Ads You See. Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.

European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statements
EEA Privacy Statement
Effective starting May 25, 2018
This EEA Privacy Statement discloses information about the privacy practices with respect to personal data protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the EEA. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.
In addition to this statement, other notices have been published applying to the use and other processing that may be subject to the GDPR of personal data of Prospective Students and Applicants; Students; Students in Tufts-sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA; Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services; Alumni and Donors;Research Participants and for Online Education and Non-Degree Educational Programs.
The information provided in this statement applies to any of your EEA Personal Data that we may collect, use or otherwise process under the GDPR. An explanation of EEA Personal Data is provided below.
1. Information associated with tufts.edu and other Tufts Websites
For information associated with a Tufts website, this EEA Privacy Statement should be read together with the Privacy Statement for tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites that have pointed you to that statement (together, a "Site" or "Sites").
The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in the EEA and you voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in the Privacy Statement [add link] and in this EEA Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or stored in, the United States.
2. Why have I been directed to this webpage?
The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts. You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public. The below information is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.
3. What is “EEA Personal Data?”
Your personal information is EEA Personal Data if:
It is “personal data” as defined in the GDPR; and
The GDPR includes protection of the personal data in its scope.
What is “personal data” under the GDPR?
The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).
What is the scope of the GDPR?
The GDPR generally applies to collecting, using or other “processing” (please see below) of personal data (as provided in Article 3):
When the processing is part of the activities of an organization that acts in an established way in the EEA. It's not required that the processing take place in the EEA.
When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the organization offers goods or services to persons who are physically in the EEA. A payment for the goods or services is not required.
When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the processing activities are related to the monitoring of the behavior of a person who is physically in the EEA, as far as their behavior takes place within the EEA.
For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.
“Processing” is a term used by the GDPR to cover any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to destroying. GDPR Article 4 (2).
4. What is the purpose and lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data?
It is Tufts' policy to collect, use and process EEA Personal Data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under the GDPR. A legal basis under the GDPR may be:
We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests.
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
We need to process your data in connection with your or another person's vital interest.
We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.
We have another legal basis permitted under the GDPR.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your EEA Personal Data. It is Tufts' policy to not use EEA Personal Data to carry out any automated decision-making that affect you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the GDPR.
What are the purposes and lawful bases under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites?
Tufts will process your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.
The use of your EEA Personal Data in the manner described above and in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Sites, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Sites collect limited EEA Personal Data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your EEA Personal Data into an online form on any of our Sites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).
5. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?
We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your EEA Personal Data is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.
6. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?
Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.
7. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?
The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.
The right of access. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
The right to correct. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten). The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
The right to restrict processing. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
The right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
The right to object. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.
8. Where can I go if I have questions?
If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data, please see How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR or contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at dataprivacy@tufts.edu.
If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.
9. Changes to this Privacy Statement
Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.
This Privacy Statement was last updated on March 13, 2020.

How to Make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA) provides individuals with rights relating to their EEA Personal Data.
Tufts' EEA Privacy Statement describes what personal information qualifies as EEA Personal Data protected by the GDPR. For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.
The rights provided by the GDPR for EEA Personal Data include:
The right of access.
The right to correct.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).
The right to restrict processing.
The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).
The right to object.
All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations. More information about these rights may be found in the GDPR and in the EEA Privacy Statement.
Requesting to exercise your rights under the GDPR is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR). A Subject Access Request form is made available for your convenience. The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.
Subject Access Request Form [PDF]
Before we can act on your request, we must:
Confirm your identity
Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.
On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, Tufts is obliged to provide you information on our actions on your request within one month. That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.
As provided in the GDPR, if a person's data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.

Each school has developed its own practices for sharing your personal information based on its consideration of the type and sensitivity of the personal information, the purpose for which the information was provided or otherwise collected, the purpose for sharing the personal information, and the safeguards used to protect the shared information. Accordingly, under certain, considered circumstances, and when relevant, your personal information may also be shared with:
Parents, Spouses, and Guardians. In some cases, we may share your information with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary to properly complete the admissions process or in the event of an emergency.

7. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?
We will store your EEA Personal Data for as long as necessary to complete the application process. Some schools store applicant information permanently.

If you are admitted and decide to enroll, your personal information will be kept as part of your student record for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Details about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedule and is available from the school to which you applied. Additional information about how long student information may be retained is available in the EEA Privacy Statement for Students.
8. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?
The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to Make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.
The right of access. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
The right to correct. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten). The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
The right to restrict processing. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances.

Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
The right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
The right to object. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.
9. Where can I go if I have questions?

EEA Privacy Statement for Students
The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to students whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools, while they are students at Tufts. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.
This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.
In addition to the information provided in this statement, students are encouraged to review the information about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for their school. FERPA permits the disclosure of certain personal information classified by a school as “directory” information. See School of Arts and Sciences and School of Engineering FERPA Notice; The Fletcher School FERPA Notice; Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine FERPA Notice; Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy FERPA Notice; School of Dental Medicine FERPA Notice; Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences FERPA Notice; and School of Medicine FERPA Notice. Privacy Blocks are available to students who wish to prevent the University from disclosing their directory information (in student directories and commencement programs, for example) by selecting the appropriate privacy settings through SIS (http://go.tufts.edu/sis).
1. What is “EEA Personal Data”?
For purposes of this statement for students, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a student, or your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA.
The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).
The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).
2. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?
When you applied to become a student, you were told how Tufts would use your EEA Personal Data to process your application and for related purposes (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants).

3. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?
The information published here applies to the use, sharing and disclosure of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University, including its schools, units, centers and other affiliated organizations.
4. What EEA Personal Data will be processed?
The EEA Personal Data that Tufts keeps a record of may include the EEA Personal Data:
you provided in connection with your admission to Tufts, including financial aid applications, (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants)

Among the EEA Personal Data included may be your name, home and local addresses, student identification number, Social Security number or other governmental identification numbers, date of birth, courses taken, fee payments, financial aid provided, and information about your examinations, assessments and results.
Your EEA Personal Data is created, stored and transmitted in a variety of paper and electronic formats, including databases at Tufts (such as the main student records database, or the systems used by Tufts libraries).

In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health or disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.
Tufts' Non-Discrimination Policy “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”

To fulfill and monitor our legal obligations under equal opportunity, immigration and public safety laws and regulations, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

EEA Privacy Statement for Online Education and Non-Degree Educational Programs
This section includes the introduction for the EEA Privacy Statement for Online Education and Non-Degree Educational Programs. The remainder of this text can be found in the PDF link below.
This statement provides information about the use of EEA Personal Data provided by or about prospective and enrolled students and learners in online courses and/or non-degree educational programs at Tufts University, including all of its schools and affiliated centers.
The students and other learners may include high-school students, working professionals, alumni, community members, lifelong learners, Tufts students, and Tufts faculty and staff.
Our courses and programs may be offered by Tufts faculty and staff and/or in collaboration with other universities or other organizations that support online, travel and other learning experiences.
Tufts’ online courses include degree programs offered completely online, degree programs offered in a hybrid form of online courses together with on campus or other in person sessions, courses for credit in degree programs provided primarily on campus, and many courses offered in our educational programs that do not award a degree.
Tufts’ schools offer many programs that provide engaging educational experiences without requiring the participants to commit to seeking a degree. Our non-degree educational programs include online, on campus and/or other in person sessions. They may be focused over a few days or weeks, winter term, summer term, during the academic year, a full year or longer. Among our non-degree programs are:
Programs granting a certificate upon completion
Continuing education programs for professionals
Executive education programs
Pre-college and college courses for high school students
Courses offered to learners who are not receiving academic credit toward a degree, that may also be offered for credit to students enrolled in degree programs
Special, focused programs offered to learners, but that do not grant credit toward a Tufts academic degree
Programs offered off campus that include travel to places around the world
This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.
This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement. Additional EEA Privacy Statements are also provided for other programs at Tufts, including for students applying to our degree programs and enrolling in those programs. See our EEA Privacy Statements.
Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs. Students applying for or enrolling in Tufts’ Study Abroad Programs in the EEA should review the EEA Privacy Statement for Students in Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA.
Offerings with Other Parties or Institutions. Students enrolling in the online programs offered in collaboration with another entity or institutions should also review such parties’ privacy policies for those programs, available under the websites of such parties (the “Collaboration Parties”).
