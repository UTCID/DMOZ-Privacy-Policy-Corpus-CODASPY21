Knee Pain
Nagging knee pain can be hard to ignore, affecting you even when you’re sitting. But you can find relief.
Allegheny Health Network (AHN) helps active people and athletes bounce back from problems they thought would never go away.
Knee pain care at Allegheny Health Network: Why choose us?
If knee pain is keeping you from your favorite activities, we want to help you get back on your feet. Our orthopaedic surgeons perform complex procedures such as ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) repair to restore normal functioning. We were the first program in western Pennsylvania using Mako™ robotic technology to perform knee replacement surgery through small incisions. This level of expertise is why local athletes put their trust in our program. To learn more, read Autumn's story.
Our certified physical therapists use sophisticated equipment to take your recovery to the next level. Our anti-gravity treadmill reduces the force of gravity on your knees while you walk or run. This technology makes it possible to safely resume activity earlier in your recovery. The treadmill and other physical therapy equipment are available in our physical therapy facilities.

Causes of knee pain
Common causes of knee pain include:
Arthritis
Orthopaedic trauma, including a broken kneecap
Sports injuries, such as patellofemoral pain or “runner’s knee”
Tears in the meniscus, the tissue that protects your knee joint
Injury to the ACL, the connective tissue that holds your knee in place
Treatments for knee pain
We perform a complete examination, including imaging tests when necessary, to get to the source of the pain so we can find a treatment solution for you. Read more about orthopaedic diagnosis.
An accurate diagnosis helps us determine the treatments that best meet your unique needs. Treatments include:
Bracing: Wearing a device (brace) protects your knee while it heals by limiting movement. Bracing allows your knee and supporting tissue to rest, which helps reduce swelling.
Medication: Medications may relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Many people get relief with over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen. If the pain is severe, you may need a prescription medication.
Injections: Injecting medications directly into the source of the pain may help you get relief from stubborn pain. Find out more about injections.
Physical therapy: Our certified physical therapists help you strengthen the muscles that support your knee. We also show you how to safely transition back to everyday activities. Learn more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
Surgery: If you need surgery, we explain what to expect every step of the way, so you feel prepared and confident about your procedure. During surgery, we may remove bone fragments or swollen tissue. We also show you how to get around safely while you recover. Find out more about orthopaedic surgery.
Preventive services: We offer many services, including strength training, to lower your risk for future knee problems. If you are an athlete, our speed and agility training helps you come back better than ever. Read more about sports performance services.
