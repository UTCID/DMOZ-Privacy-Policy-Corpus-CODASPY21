The Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) is a ranking from 0.00 (lowest) to 99.95 (highest) agreed by COAG as a nationally equivalent measure of a person's relative academic ranking within their complete age cohort in the year they graduated from senior secondary school. (This includes students who did not complete Year 12, completed but did not qualify for an ATAR, or had already previously left school, who account for around 30% of the age cohort.)The ATAR is derived from the scaled scores achieved for senior secondary school subjects. The specific calculation used is different in each state and territory but the result is designed to be nationally equivalent.

Representatives are also involved in policy and decision making, organisation of events and help to promote clubs and societies.DUSA student representatives are elected by DUSA members and any DUSA full student member can be a student representative. In the past, student representatives have been involved in everything from the price of parking to the implementation of the trimester system. Once elected, representatives want to know what you think, so make sure you know who your representatives are so that you can have your say.Find out more at DeakinSync under Help & feedback or to the DUSA Student representative website.
