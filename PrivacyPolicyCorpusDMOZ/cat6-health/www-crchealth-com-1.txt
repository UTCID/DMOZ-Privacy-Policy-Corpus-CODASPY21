Privacy PracticesThis notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.  Please review it carefully.
Acadia Healthcare will be referred to in this Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) as “Acadia”.  This Notice is given to you by an Acadia Facility to describe the ways in which Acadia may use and disclose your medical information (called “protected health information” or “PHI”) and to notify you of your rights with respect to PHI in the possession of Acadia.  Acadia protects the privacy of PHI, which also is protected from disclosure by state and federal law.  In certain circumstances, pursuant to this Notice, patient authorization or applicable laws and regulations, PHI can be used by Acadia or disclosed to other parties.  Below are categories describing these uses and disclosures, along with some examples to help you better understand each category.
Uses and Disclosures for Treatment,  Payment and Health Care Operations
Acadia may use or disclose your PHI for the purposes of treatment, payment and health care operations, described in more detail below, without obtaining written authorization from you.
FOR TREATMENT:  Acadia may use and disclose PHI in the course of providing, coordinating, or managing your medical treatment, including the disclosure of PHI for treatment activities at another healthcare facility.  These types of uses and disclosures may take place between physicians, nurses, technicians, students, and other health care professionals who provide you health care services or are otherwise involved in your care.  For example, if you are being treated by a primary care physician, that physician may need to use/disclose PHI to a specialist physician whom he or she consults regarding your condition, or to a nurse who is assisting in your care.
FOR PAYMENT:  Acadia may use and disclose PHI in order to collect payment for the health care services provided to you.  For example, Acadia may need to give PHI to your health plan in order to be reimbursed for the services provided to you.  Acadia may also disclose PHI to their business associates, such as billing companies, claims processing companies, and others that assist in processing health claims.  Acadia may also disclose PHI to other health care providers and health plans for the payment activities of such providers or health plans.
FOR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS:  Acadia may use and disclose PHI as part of their operations, including for quality assessment and improvement, such as evaluating the treatment and services you receive and the performance of our staff in caring for you.  Other activities include hospital training, underwriting activities, compliance and risk management activities, planning and development, and management and administration.  Acadia may disclose PHI to doctors, nurses, technicians, students, attorneys, consultants, accountants, and others for review and learning purposes.  These disclosures help make sure that Acadia is complying with all applicable laws, and are continuing to provide health care to patients at a high level of quality.  Acadia may also disclose PHI to other health care facilities plans for certain of their operations, including their quality assessment and improvement activities, credentialing and peer review activities, and health care fraud and abuse detection or compliance, provided that those other facilities and plans have, or have had in the past, a relationship with the patient who is the subject of the information.
FOR SHARING PHI AMONG ACADIA AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF:  Acadia works together with physicians and other care providers on their professional staff to provide medical services to you when you are a patient at an Acadia Facility.  Acadia and members of their respective professional staff will share PHI with each other as needed to perform their treatment, payment and health care operations activities.

Generally, you have the right to inspect and copy your PHI in the possession of Acadia if you make a request in writing to the applicable Acadia Hospital’s Medical Records Department.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving your request (unless extended by an additional thirty (30) days), Acadia will inform you of the extent to which your request has or has not been granted.  In some cases, Acadia may provide you a summary of the PHI you request if you agree in advance to such a summary and any associated fees.  If you request copies of your PHI or agree to a summary of your PHI, Acadia may impose a reasonable fee to cover copying, postage, and related costs.  If Acadia denies access to your PHI, it will explain the basis for denial and your opportunity to have the denial reviewed by a licensed health care professional (not involved in the initial denial decision) designated as a reviewing official.  If Acadia does not maintain the PHI you request, if it knows where that PHI is located it will tell you how to redirect your request.
If you believe that your PHI maintained by Acadia contains an error or needs to be updated, you have the right to request that the entity correct or supplement your PHI.  Your request must be made in writing to the local Medical Records Department and it must explain why you are requesting an amendment to your PHI.  Within sixty (60) days of receiving your request (unless extended by an additional thirty (30) days), Acadia will inform you of the extent to which your request has or has not been granted.  Acadia generally can deny your request if your request relates to PHI: (i) not created by Acadia; (ii) that is not part of the records Acadia maintains; (iii) that is not subject to being inspected by you; or (iv) that is accurate and complete.  If your request is denied, Acadia will give you a written denial that explains the reason for the denial and your rights to: (i) file a statement disagreeing with the denial; (ii) submit a request that any future disclosures of the relevant PHI be made with a copy of your request and Acadia’s denial attached, if you do not file a statement of disagreement; and (iii) complain about the denial.
You generally have the right to request and receive a list of disclosures of your PHI Acadia has made during the six (6) years prior to your request (but not before April 14, 2003).  The list will not include disclosures (i) for which you have provided a written authorization; (ii) for treatment, payment, and health care operations; (iii) made to you; (iv) for an Acadia patient directory or to persons involved in your health care; (v) for national security or intelligence purposes; (vi) to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials; or (vii) of a limited data set.  You should submit any such request to the Privacy Officer, and within sixty (60) days of receiving your request (unless extended by an additional thirty (30) days), Acadia will respond to you regarding the status of your request.  The entity will provide the list to you at not charge, but if you make more than one request in a year you will be charged $25.00 for each additional request.
You have the right to receive PHI in an electronic format, if electronic medical records are in use in the facility.

You have the right to receive notice in the event of a breach of confidentiality.
You have the right to opt out of fundraising communications.
