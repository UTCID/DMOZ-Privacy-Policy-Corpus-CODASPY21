Privacy Policy
In keeping with state and federal legislation, the University safeguards the privacy of patients, students, employees, University business, and other matters by protecting electronic records classified as confidential information. Unauthorized accessing and/or disclosure of confidential information by University employees is prohibited and may result in legal penalties. This policy applies to records maintained in any type of electronic record: computer, voice, or video. It also applies to records created via the Georgetown University website.
Definitions
Electronic Records: Electronic transmissions or messages created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic systems or services. This definition of electronic records applies equally to the contents of such records, attachments to such records, and transactional information associated with such records.
University Administrative Record: A University Record (see definition below) that is directly related to the conduct of the University’s administrative business.
University Record: By law, University records are any papers, books, photographs, tapes, films, recordings, or other documentary materials, or any copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made, produced, executed, or received by any department or office of the University or by any academic or administrative staff member in connection with the transaction of University business, and retained by that agency or its successor as evidence of its activities or functions because of the information contained therein.
University Electronic Record: A University Record in the form of an electronic record, whether or not any of the electronic communications resources utilized to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print the electronic communications record are owned by the University. This implies that the location of the record, or the location of its creation or use, does not change its nature as a University electronic record for purposes of this or other University policy.
Until determined otherwise or unless it is clear from the context, any electronic record residing on university-owned or controlled telecommunications, video, audio, and computing facilities will be deemed to be a University electronic record for purposes of this Policy.
Principles
Notification Users should be notified that information is being collected and they should be informed of their rights. (e.g., all Web pages that collect personally identifiable information should include a privacy notice that specifies how the information will be used.)
Minimization The institution should gather as little information as possible for legitimate purposes and delete information when it is no longer needed or no longer required by law to be retained. (e.g., library records need not be kept for more than a certain limited period of time.)
Secondary Use Information should be used only for the purposes for which it was collected unless the individual gives additional consent. (e.g., a department should not share information with an administrative office for a separate purpose without the individual’s knowledge and consent.)
Nondisclosure and Consent Information should not be released to third parties external to the University without consent. (e.g., vendors, business, etc.)
Need to Know Only those with legitimate, official needs should have access to information. (e.g., a person’s position of authority in the University does not necessarily mean that they should be able to access information.)
Data Accuracy, Inspection, and Review Information must be accurate, and individuals should have the right to examine information about themselves and request changes. (e.g., employees should be able to review their records and make changes or follow a standard process for any information that is disputed.)
Information Security, Integrity, and Accountability Information should be secure and not vulnerable to unauthorized modification, and the handling of the data must be subject to accountability. (e.g., it should always be known who has access to information and changes to information should be documented.)
Education The University has the responsibility to educate its constituents concerning privacy rights and the proper handling of information. (e.g., all constituents should know whom to consult about these matters and all employees should understand their responsibilities for abiding by policies for information handling.)
