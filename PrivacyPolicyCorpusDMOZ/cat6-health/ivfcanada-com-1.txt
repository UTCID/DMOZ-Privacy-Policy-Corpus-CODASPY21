Domestic and International copyright and trademark laws protect the entire contents of the Site.
IVF Canada encourages and permits links to Content on the Site. However, IVF Canada is an organization committed to the highest professional standards.

Furthermore, IVF Canada does not grant its consent for links to the Site where the linking party engages in any Prohibited Conduct (as described in these Terms of Use). We reserve the right to withdraw permission for any link at any time.
Subject to your full compliance with these terms, IVF Canada authorizes you to view the Content, make a single copy of it, and print that copy, but only for your own lawful, personal, noncommercial use, provided that you maintain all copyright, trademark and other intellectual property notices contained in such Content, and provided that the Content, or any part thereof, is not modified.
