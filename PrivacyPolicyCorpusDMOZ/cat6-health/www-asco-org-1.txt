Information identifying current providers of such protection is available on the Internet (e.g., en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content-control_software).
20. General Terms
Export Laws. Content, services and products derived or obtained from the Website or Apps may be subject to the U.S. export laws and the export or import laws of other countries.

Entire Agreement. The Terms of Use and any documents expressly incorporated herein constitute the entire agreement between you and ASCO relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms of Use and any other prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Website, the Apps, and the Content. No modification to the Terms of Use will be binding on ASCO, unless in writing and signed by an authorized ASCO representative or posted by ASCO to the Website or Apps.

You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if ASCO seeks such an injunction.
No Waiver. No waiver by ASCO or failure to exercise promptly any right of ASCO under the Terms of Use will create or be deemed to create a further or continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement.
Severability. If any provision of the Terms of Use is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, such provision shall be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, or eliminated or limited to the minimum extent necessary, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.

Choice of Law and Forum Selection.  The Terms of Use and all matters relating hereto or to the Website, the Apps, or the Content shall for all purposes be governed, interpreted, construed, and enforced solely and exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.  Any disputes or controversies not subject to the negotiation and arbitration provisions set forth in Section 21 of these Terms of Use shall be decided by a state or federal court serving the city of Alexandria, Virginia, United States.  You expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by such courts and agree that you will not object to jurisdiction of or venue in such courts on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, or otherwise.
21. Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
REVIEW THIS SECTION 21 CAREFULLY.  IT LIMITS YOUR ABILITY TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CLAIMS IN COURT, YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY DECIDE CERTAIN CLAIMS, AND YOUR ABILITY TO COMBINE CLAIMS AND TO BRING CLAIMS THROUGH CLASS ACTIONS.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY USING AND/OR BECOMING A REGISTERED USER OF THE WEBSITE OR APPS OR BY DOWNLOADING ANY APPS, YOU CONSENT AND CHOOSE TO HAVE SUCH CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO BINDING ARBITRATION.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.
A. Mandatory Arbitration of Certain Claims
You agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 21, all Claims (as that term is defined in Section 21) shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the Claim is filed (“AAA Rules”).  Each Claim shall be submitted to a single arbitrator selected through mutual agreement of the parties.  The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable.  Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement.  Except as otherwise indicated in these Terms of Use, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, and/or enforceability of these Terms of Use and any terms or documents incorporated herein, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use are void or voidable.  The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Alexandria, Virginia and shall be subject to these Terms of Use and the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.  The arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action (as defined below) nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.  No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Before you take a dispute to arbitration or to small claims court, you must first contact us in writing and describe (a) the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) the specific relief sought and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  Similarly, before ASCO takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you.  If you and ASCO do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days from the date such notification is provided, you or ASCO may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The amount of any settlement offer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which the parties to the arbitration are entitled. After ASCO receives notice that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee required by the arbitration administrator, unless your Claim is for greater than $75,000.
If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your Claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of ASCO’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then ASCO will pay you the amount of the award or $10,000, whichever is greater.
If ASCO prevails before the arbitrator, and if we show that you acted in bad faith in bringing your claim, then ASCO may seek to recover the AAA’s fees and expenses of the arbitrator from you.
B.  Class Action Waiver.
Each of you and ASCO expressly agree that any Claim(s) must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”).  You and ASCO expressly agree to waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum raising a Claim covered by this Section 21.  Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms of Use to the contrary, any Claim, dispute, or controversy alleging that all or part of the Class Action waiver contained in this Subsection 21.B is invalid, illegal, unenforceable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
22. Additional Terms Applicable to Specific Services Provided Through the Website and Apps
Additional terms of use may apply to your use of particular services provided through the Website or Apps.  Such terms may be set forth below, posted on areas of the Website or Apps where particular services are provided to you, or posted on pop-up windows which may appear in connection with your use of specific services.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 1, above, within the Website and Apps, the phrase “I Agree,” “Agree” or words of like import are intended to be an additional way in which you confirm your binding assent to such additional terms, and by clicking on an “I Agree,” “Agree” or similar button you enter into a binding contract.
In the case of a conflict between the Terms of Use and any additional terms you may encounter on the Website or Apps, the Terms of Use shall govern, except to the extent as may be explicitly set forth in those additional terms.

The renewal charge will be at the then-current published rates for the term or renewal term of your subscription. If you are an individual registered subscriber (i.e., any subscriber other than a bulk or institutional subscriber) who has purchased an annual subscription and you elect to cancel such subscription during the subscription year, you will be entitled to a refund of the remainder of your subscription fees on a pro-rata basis within a reasonable period of time following the effective date of our receipt of your cancellation (partial months will not be refunded). No other refunds of fees will be provided including, without limitation, refunds for cancelled bulk or institutional subscriptions.
24. The ASCOCareer Center™
The following additional terms apply to your use of the ASCO Career Center™;  the “Career Center”). The Career Center provides, among other things, career management information, Content, resources, and tools enabling (a) oncology professionals seeking employment (“job seekers”) to search and apply for potential employment opportunities and post their resumes to the Career Center in furtherance thereof; and (b) oncology professionals, suppliers, and providers seeking to fill job positions (“employers”) to search for potential candidates and post-employment listings and opportunities to the Career Center in connection therewith.

In addition, and consistent with the Terms of Use, you acknowledge and agree that there are risks including, but not limited to, the risk of physical harm or dealing with strangers, foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through the Career Center.
ASCO prohibits without limitation any employer or job seeker from (a) posting jobs or content on the Career Center that contain hyperlinks, "hidden" keywords or any keywords that are irrelevant to the job or are otherwise misleading; (b) using the Career Center for any purpose other than as an employer seeking employees or an individual seeking employment, including but not limited to using the information in the Career Center to sell or to promote any products or services; and (c) taking any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure supporting the Career Center. ASCO has the right to expel you and prevent your further access to the Career Center for violating the foregoing. ASCO may review and delete any job posting that, in the sole judgment of ASCO, violates these Terms; violates applicable law, rule or regulation; is offensive or illegal; or violates the rights of, harms or threatens the safety of any users.
You understand and agree that ASCO does not control, monitor, manage or regulate your communications, transactions, activities or dealings with other job seekers or employers (as applicable), the manner in which you use the Website, or the information you send or receive from others (beyond the rights and obligations specifically set forth in this Agreement) through the Website.
