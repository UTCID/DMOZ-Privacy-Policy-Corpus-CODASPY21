The University of Ottawa Heart Institute is committed to continuously improving quality and patient safety. At the Heart Institute, our patients come first. We partner with patient, family (when appropriate) and other healthcare providers to ensure an optimal experience. We provide services that are respectful and responsive to patient needs, preferences and expectations. It is our goal to ensure patients have the information and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care.
