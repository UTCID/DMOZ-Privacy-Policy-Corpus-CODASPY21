Submit a Complaint
To submit a complaint related to privacy matters, please contact the AVMA Data Protection Officer.
European Law
Data protection law in Europe requires a lawful basis for collecting and retaining Personal Information. Our lawful bases include:
Consent: The AVMA received your consent to use your Personal Information as described by our Terms of Service.
Contractual obligations: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services or ship products that you purchase from AVMA.
Legal compliance: In some cases, such as financial transactions and taxes, we are required by law to collect, use and retain some data for our records.
Legitimate interests: We have legitimate business interests to use your Personal Information in ways that are expected to deliver our Services.
Information Security
The AVMA takes your privacy and data security very seriously. We take appropriate measures to protect Personal Information entrusted to us from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. These measures include, but are not limited to:
employing up-to-date technology and security; and
establishing privacy protection controls through contractual obligations for third-party engagements; and
enforcing policies that hold AVMA employees accountable to maintain the confidentiality of personally-identifiable information, subject to disciplinary action for any breach, up to and including employee termination.
Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure and the AVMA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any personal or Non-Personal Information you provide to us. In the event that Personal Information is compromised by a breach of security, the AVMA will promptly notify all affected individuals in compliance with applicable law.
Data Accuracy and Retention
We do our best to make sure your Personal Information is accurate and up to date. Since most Personal Information is self-reported, we rely on you to provide us with the most current information. We ask that you frequently visit your profile, review your Personal Information for accuracy and make corrections as needed.

Performance – assist with the performance of the Services
Analytics – cookies that provide insights into use of the Services
Marketing – cookies that help understand utilization and effectiveness of communications and marketing campaigns
If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your web browser's documentation. By disabling cookies, you may inhibit certain features of our Services from being accessible or functioning properly.
Children's Privacy
