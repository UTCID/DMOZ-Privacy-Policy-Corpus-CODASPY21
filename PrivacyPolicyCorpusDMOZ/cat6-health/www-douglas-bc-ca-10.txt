Making your Decision
Is Douglas Right for me?
What do I want to do?
WHAT ATMOSPHERE DO I PREFER FOR LEARNING?
DO I LIKE BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY?
HOW ARE MY GRADES?
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE FOR SCHOOL?
What do I want to do?
What do I want to do?
Picking a career can be a tough decision. At Douglas, you can explore your options while earning credits you can put towards a credential, with the assurance that you’re putting your time and money to good use.
WHAT ATMOSPHERE DO I PREFER FOR LEARNING?
WHAT ATMOSPHERE DO I PREFER FOR LEARNING?
Douglas gives you the opportunity to interact with your classmates and ask your professors questions about what you’re learning. It’s harder to get that in first- or second-year classes at university, where there are sometimes up to 500 students per class.
DO I LIKE BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY?
DO I LIKE BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY?
Maybe you’re a joiner – or maybe you aren’t. Either way, if you like being where you can get to know people and have them call you by name, you’ll love the smaller community at Douglas.
HOW ARE MY GRADES?
HOW ARE MY GRADES?
Universities often require high grades to get in, while colleges are more flexible. If university is your ultimate goal, you can still start at Douglas and then transfer your credits, if chosen carefully, to a university.
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE FOR SCHOOL?
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE FOR SCHOOL?
Douglas offers some of the lowest tuition fees in the province. If you’re planning on getting a degree from a university, you can save almost $4,500 by doing your first two years at Douglas and then transferring. Double that if you stay at Douglas to complete a four-year bachelor’s degree.
