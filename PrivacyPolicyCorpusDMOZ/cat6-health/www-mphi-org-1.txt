Privacy PolicySince the primary function of MPHI is not to provide health care, MPHI is permitted to designate itself as a “hybrid entity”, which allows it to apply the HIPAA Privacy Rule only to those components at MPHI that, if standing alone, would be a covered entity. As a hybrid entity, MPHI must identify in writing its covered components.
Covered components at MPHI are the:
CHAMPS Helpline Project
Medicaid Eligibility Support Project
