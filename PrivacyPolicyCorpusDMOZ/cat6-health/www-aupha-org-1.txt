We respect your privacy.
Any personal
information you provide to us including and similar to your name,
address, telephone number and e-mail address will not be released,
sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of our organization except as noted below.
With whom do we share the personal information we collect through this site?
Our Service Providers
We
may share your personal information with companies (including our
affiliates) that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies
that help process credit card payments. Our service providers are
required by contract to protect the confidentiality of the personal
information we share with them and to use it only to provide specific
services on our behalf.
Business Transfers
Your
personal information may be transferred to another entity (either an
affiliated entity or an unrelated third party) in connection with a
merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar corporate event. If such
a transfer were ever to occur, the acquiring entity’s use of your
personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy.
Government and Legal Disclosures
We
may disclose the personal information we collect through this Site,
when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply
with the law (or a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate
a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use, Code of Conduct or other agreements that govern your use of this Site;
or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users,
or others.
External Sites
We are not responsible for the content of external internet sites. You
are advised to read the privacy policy of external sites before
disclosing any personal information.
Cookies
A
"cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and
allows us to recognize you each time you visit this
site (personalization, etc). Cookies themselves do not contain any personal
information, and we do not use cookies to collect
personal information. Cookies may also be used by 3rd party content
providers such as newsfeeds.
Remember the risks whenever you use the internet.
While
we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to us and you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy
of any passwords or other account information. In addition other
Internet sites or services that may be accessible through our site have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and
