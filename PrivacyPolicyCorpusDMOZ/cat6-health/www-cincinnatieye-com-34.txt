Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, also known as erythema multiforme major, is a rare medical condition where the skin and mucous membranes have a severe adverse reaction to certain medications or infections. It may begin with symptoms similar to those of the flu, and can lead to skin loss or death, if left untreated.  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome frequently affects the eyes, resulting in inflammation, irritation and dryness.
Complications of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
Other conditions that occur as a result of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome include the following:
Conjunctivitis
Iritis
Blisters on the cornea
Corneal erosion
Holes in the cornea
In some cases, damage to the tissue of the conjunctiva or cornea may be severe, causing scarring and ultimately blindness.
Treatment for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
Treatments for ocular problems relating to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome typically involve clearing up infections with either antibiotics or steroids. The eyes will need to be kept well lubricated through the use of ointments or artificial tears. Some patients may require special contact lenses to protect the eyes from developing corneal abrasions due to the changes Stevens-Johnson Syndrome causes to the eyelids and eyelashes. For other patients, a corneal transplant or amniotic membrane transplant may be necessary to preserve vision.
