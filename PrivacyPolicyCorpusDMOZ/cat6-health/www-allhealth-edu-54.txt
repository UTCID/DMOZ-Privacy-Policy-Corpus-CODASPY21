Rheumatoid Arthritis

The result? An unmatched level of comprehensive care.
What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissue.
Rheumatologists often care for people with rheumatoid arthritis. These specialists are physicians who receive special training to diagnose and treat complex autoimmune conditions affecting your body’s bones, muscles, and joints.
Rheumatoid arthritis affects everyone differently. It can cause different levels of joint pain and stiffness in your legs, arms, hands, or in any combination of joints.
Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect internal organs, such as the kidneys or lungs. For some people, symptoms slowly get worse over time. Other people experience most of their symptoms in short or long bursts (called flares).

At AHN, we help you manage every way rheumatoid arthritis affects your health and life. Our team of specialists has spent many years caring for patients with different types of rheumatoid arthritis. This experience helps us get you the right diagnosis — the first step to finding relief.
Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis
To diagnose you, we use a specialized blood test that identifies certain DNA sequences (called genetic biomarkers) for rheumatoid arthritis. We use experience and innovations like this test to provide you with the right diagnosis, even if your symptoms are unusual.
Treating rheumatoid
If you have rheumatoid arthritis, our physicians provide a treatment plan that helps you manage your symptoms. This treatment plan may include:
Physical or occupational therapy to help you move or complete daily activities with less discomfort
Medications or infusion therapies to relieve painful or uncomfortable symptoms
