This Notice does not apply to Personal Data of members of our workforce in the context of that relationship.
Depending on the way you interact with us, we may occasionally provide you additional information about our processing of your Personal Data addressing specific processing activities and circumstances.

We refer to such notices here as “Supplemental Disclosures”. Supplemental Disclosures should be read together with this Notice. However, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of the Supplemental Disclosure and this Notice, the Supplemental Disclosure will prevail, but only for the Personal Data processing subject to that disclosure.

You can find a list of the relevant legal entities that act as data controllers in Appendix 1 to this Notice. Such entities may also have separate Supplemental Disclosures.

Please see the “ Contact Us” Section below for information on how to contact our DPO.

• To provide training, education, and grants, such as our training and education programs that we provide to health care professionals or where we offer grants to which health care professionals can apply.

• To conduct research and development, including to improve existing products and services and to develop new ones.
• To provide, maintain, develop, and improve our digital properties, including our websites, apps, services, and platforms.
• To maintain, improve, and investigate the security of our systems and digital properties.
• To comply with legal obligations, such as obligations relating to research, development, pharmacovigilance, marketing, and promotion of medicinal products and other healthcare products, and to respond to legal process or inquiries from authorities.
• To protect the rights, interests, and safety of us, you, and any third parties, and to exercise and defend our rights.
• To create anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated datasets. Such datasets would not be “Personal Data” subject to this Notice. We may use anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated datasets for any purpose.
The additional purposes for which we may process what are deemed special categories of personal data under certain jurisdictions’ laws are as follows to the extent relevant, necessary and permitted by applicable local law:
• Demographic data - We will use information about your sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and disability for specific reasons, such as necessary for clinical trials or to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting as required by some jurisdictions’ laws.
• Biometric data - We will use biometric data for specific reasons, such as necessary for clinical trials.
• Health data - We will use health data for patient support programs and in some cases may receive health data for clinical trials and related activities.
3. Lawful Bases of Processing
Certain jurisdictions require that we have a lawful basis to justify our processing of your Personal Data. Where applicable, the lawful bases that Viatris relies upon to justify a particular processing activity may differ from the lawful basis used to justify a different processing activity. Viatris relies on the following lawful bases to process Personal Data, as permitted under applicable law:
• Processing necessary for the negotiation, execution, or performance of contracts
• Processing to comply with legal and regulatory obligations
• Processing for reasons of public interest in the area of public health
• Processing in furtherance of our legitimate interests, including our interests to conduct legitimate business activities (such as improving our products and services, to communicate with you, to secure our systems, among other legitimate interests)
• Processing based on your consent
We may obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of Personal Data when we are required to do so by law (for example, in relation to our direct marketing activities and our use of cookies). If we ask for your consent to process your Personal Data, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this Notice. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Where required by law, we may obtain your explicit consent to collect and use special category data (see the end of section 2 above) about you. Other legal bases for our processing of special category data may include, as permitted by applicable law, for scientific research, for purposes of preventative or occupational medicine or based on a contract with a health care provider or other health professional, for employment, social security or social protection law, for reasons of substantial public interest, or as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
You can contact our DPO for more information about our processing of your Personal Data.
4. Disclosures of Personal Data
Where required by applicable law, Viatris does not rent, sell, or share Personal Data about you with non-affiliated persons for their direct marketing purposes unless we have your permission. Otherwise, however, we may disclose your Personal Data to the following categories of third parties without your consent as permitted by applicable law:
• Members of the Viatris Corporate Group, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, and Viatris Inc. in the United States.
• Service Providers, which are entities that process Personal Data on behalf of Viatris.
• Persons with legal rights to access Personal Data, including, as the case may be, law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, competent administrative and judicial authorities, and persons with validly-issued subpoenas, warrants, or other forms of legal process; and
• Parties involved in potential business transactions, including potential acquirers and other stakeholders in the event of a merger or legal restructuring operation such as an acquisition, joint venture, assignment, spin-off, divestiture, or bankruptcy.
We may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties such as social networking and other sites if you direct us to share your Personal Data with such sites or to other entities that do not fall in one of the above categories with your permission.
5. Cross-border Transfers of Personal Data
Viatris operates globally and consistent with applicable laws may process your Personal Data in jurisdictions that are not regarded as providing the same level of protection to Personal Data as the jurisdiction in which you are based.
When transferring Personal Data across borders, we take steps to put in place safeguards to protect such Personal Data as required by applicable laws. These safeguards may include:
• Transferring Personal Data to recipients located in countries deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data including where Personal Data originates in the European Union, to countries which the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data; and
• Entering into agreements containing contractual safeguards, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses that have been approved by the European Commission.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any question concerning the transfer of your Personal Data (see the “Contact Us”).
6. Data Security and Retention
Viatris implements various technical, administrative, physical, and organisational measures to protect the security and confidentiality of Personal Data. While we take measures to safeguard your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee that the Personal Data we process will remain secure.
Where required by law, Viatris will retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to accomplish the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or for the period required by the applicable laws (whichever is longer).
To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, Viatris considers the following factors:
• The volume, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data;
• The potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure;
• The purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and
• Applicable legal requirements.
When the retention of your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or our retention of such Personal Data is no longer required by law, we will delete, anonymize, de-identify, or aggregate the Personal Data such that it is no longer associated with you.
7. Your Choices and Rights
Some jurisdictions have provided individuals with certain rights in relation to the processing of their Personal Data. This is the case where you or the Viatris subsidiary or affiliate with which you interact is located in the European Union or United Kingdom, though these rights may be available in other jurisdictions too. These rights are not available to everyone, and they do not necessarily apply in all contexts. Depending on applicable law, you may have the rights to:
• Request access to your Personal Data.
• Request correction of your Personal Data (should your Personal Data be inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete).
• Request deletion of your Personal Data.
• Withdraw your consent to processing (where we processed Personal Data on the basis of your consent). Please note that withdrawing your consent applies only to future processing activities.
• Object to the processing of your Personal Data.
• Request restrictions on the processing of your Personal Data.
• Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or a third party.
• Opt-out of certain transfers to third parties.
To exercise a right that you believe you may be entitled to under applicable law, please contact our DPO. We may need to verify your identity before we fulfil your request (see also the California disclosures section below if you are a California resident).
If you feel that we have failed to comply with your request or have not addressed a complaint that you have, you may also have the right to complaint to the competent data protection or other regulatory authority in your jurisdiction.
