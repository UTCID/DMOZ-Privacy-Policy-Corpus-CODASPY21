Module 1: Introduction to Privacy and ConfidentialityPIPEDA & PHIPAOn January 1, 2004, Canada enacted privacy legislation called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). PIPEDA governs the collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information in the course of commercial activities.However, this legislation did not focus on the core activities of hospitals. This resulted in questions regarding its applicability to healthcare.On November 1, 2004, the Ontario government will enact the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA). The act provides direction to all individuals who collect, use, disclose and retain personal information and personal health information. These individuals may include staff, physicians, volunteers, students and contracted staff at healthcare facilities.What is Privacy?Privacy is the right of an individual to control his or her own personal information.
