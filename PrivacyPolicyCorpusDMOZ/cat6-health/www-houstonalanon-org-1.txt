Cookies and Session Tracking
We do not use browser cookies, so we do not collect or use information about your site preferences or history or track your previous visits. We do provide links to other Al-Anon websites and mapping services. These sites have their own privacy practices and we cannot control whether or not they use cookies or what they do with your session information. However, we do not forward any information about you or your page views, except when viewing a map, and that information is the generic address, only.
