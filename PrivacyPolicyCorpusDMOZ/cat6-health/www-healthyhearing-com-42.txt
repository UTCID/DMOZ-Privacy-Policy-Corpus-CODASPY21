Cleaning a hearing aid
Because hearing aids are meant to be worn daily, they require occasional upkeep to stay in working order. Some of the necessary accessories needed to care for and maintain your hearing aid may be provided by your hearing care provider as part of your hearing aids purchase. Others you may need to purchase separately, and are purely optional.
In addition, if you have hearing loss, you might also be interested in purchasing an assistive listening device (ALD) to boost your hearing experience. ALDs can make it easier to talk on phone, watch TV, attend public events and participate in work meetings.
Must-have hearing aid accessories
Batteries
Batteries are a must-have for
hearing aids.
All hearing aids require a power source to function. Unless you have rechargeable hearing aids, you’re going to need an ongoing supply of disposable hearing aid "button" batteries.
Hearing aid batteries are available in four different sizes. From smallest to largest, these are: 10, 312, 13 and 675. Your hearing aids will run on one of these specific types of batteries, and your hearing care provider will usually provide a small number of batteries to get you started.  Batteries use a standardized color coding system to help ensure you get the right type.
Size 10 batteries - yellow
Size 312 batteries - brown
Size 13 batteries - orange
Size 675 batteries - blue
Always carry spare batteries with you so you’re prepared for your day and can keep your hearing aids running without interruption. Also, because batteries are an ongoing purchase, ask your provider about any battery clubs or mail order programs that can make battery purchases convenient and economical.
Always carry spare batteries with you.
Cleaning tools
Cleaning and hearing aid care
should be part of your daily routine.
Regular cleaning, along with routine maintenance from your hearing care provider will keep your hearing aids working reliably and will extend their useful life. These are the most common tools to use for everyday cleaning.
Optional hearing aid accessories
While batteries and cleaning equipment are essentials for every hearing aid wearer, these optional accessories might make caring for your devices easier or help you get more benefit from them.
Hearing aid dryer/dehumidifier: If you perspire heavily, live in a humid climate or enjoy lots of outdoor activity that might expose your hearing aids to damaging moisture, these accessories can help.
The right accessories can make wearing
hearing aids fun, especially for kids.
Basic dehumidifiers use a desiccant to draw out moisture overnight. The desiccant will last a long time with regular reactivation. Some desiccants are contained in a soft pouch that can be reactivated in the microwave oven for about 1 minute. Others are housed in a metal tin that can be placed in an oven heated to 325° for about 30 minutes.
The more sophisticated ReNew hearing aid dry box is a small electronic device that uses UV light to dry and sanitize hearing aids overnight. These are available for purchase online or through your hearing care professional.
Bluetooth streaming devices: Most advanced hearing devices are already Bluetooth compatible, making it easy to connect wirelessly to various devices like cell phones, MP3 players and televisions. You will probably need a relatively inexpensive external streaming device designed to work with your specific hearing aids.
Assistive listening devices: These accessories can help your hearing aids work better in very specialized listening environments like classrooms, lecture halls, music venues and theaters. Some work with your home telephone to make conversations easier and still others can vibrate to wake you in the morning or alert you when someone is at your door.
Carrying case. If you're a fan of swimming or other outdoor activities, you may need to occasionally remove your hearing aids when out and about. Waterproof, shatterproof carrying cases, such as the AidKeeper, can be a great idea to keep your hearing aids safe and dry.
Hearing aid accessories for lifestyles
The examples above are just a few of the numerous hearing aid accessories tailored to specific lifestyles. If you enjoy golf, biking or running, sweatbands will help keep perspiration from reaching delicate hearing instruments. Other accessories have clips that enable you to participate in sports or physical activities while keeping devices clean, dry and prevent them from falling out.
Other accessories like colorful charms and decals can help make wearing hearing aids more fun whether you’re a fashion-conscious adult or a child who wants to express individuality.
If you have hearing loss, the first step is to find the right treatment for you by visiting a hearing care professional. And, before purchasing any hearing aid accessory, consult with them to be sure it will work with your hearing aids.
