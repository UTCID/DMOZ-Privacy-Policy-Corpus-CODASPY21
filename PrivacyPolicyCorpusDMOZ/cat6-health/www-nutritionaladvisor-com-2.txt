The purpose of the following entries is to briefly explain certain pathological conditions and to show the importance and contribution of nutrition, nutritional supplements, and herbs. The entries are not meant as treatment protocols, prescriptions for cure, therapeutic proposals or corrective remedies.
Every person is different and personalized services may be provided only by qualified health professionals to a particular and specific individual. This is why no dosages are given. Consult the following for information only, not for curative purposes. The diets, nutrients and herbs listed under each ailment are known to help, but because of individual differences and the severity of some diseases, you are strongly advised to seek consultation and monitoring by one of our qualified health care professionals (see Services - Customized Programs).
