Indirectly. This may be through emails, forms, face-to-face meetings, interviews, registration, attendance at seminars, business cards, online queries and telephone conversations, as well as services through our website and social media channels.
From third parties. For example, we sometimes use third parties to analyse traffic to our website and social media channels. This may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are electronic identifiers that are transferred automatically to your computer via your browser. They allow our systems to save certain details so you are recognised when you visit our website again. This stops you from needing to log in repeatedly, which saves time, and creates a customised website that fits your needs. You may disable or refuse to accept cookies by changing the preferences or settings on your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you can still use our website, but you won’t be able to use all features.
