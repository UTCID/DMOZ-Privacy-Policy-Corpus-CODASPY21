The PDR Websites, the PDR Applications and the Services may contain links to third-party websites (the "Linked Sites"). We do not control the Linked Sites, and are not responsible or liable for their content or their privacy and data collection policies and practices. The Linked Sites are provided for your convenience, and you access them at your own risk, subject to their terms, conditions, and privacy policies.

You may access all or part of the PDR Websites, the PDR Applications and the Services (including Content) via third party environments, services, systems, or applications, such as electronic health records, electronic medical records or electronic prescribing applications or systems ("Third Party Environments"), which may have their own terms of use. Any such terms of use do not apply to your use of the PDR Websites, the PDR Applications and the Services. You may opt out of any of the Services contained in a Third Party Environment, if and to the extent allowed, by following the processes and policies of such Third Party Environment.
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT INFORMATION AND OTHER CONTENT
The PDR Websites, the PDR Applications and the PDR Services display pharmaceutical drug products’ FDA-approved or other manufacturer-supplied labeling. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic ("FD&C") Act, a manufacturer may label, promote, and advertise a drug approved for marketing only for those uses for which the drug’s safety and effectiveness have been established. The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Section 201.100(d)(1), requires that Content about prescription products, such as "indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions," be the "same in language and emphasis" as is approved for product labeling. All product label information appearing in the Content is prepared and approved by the applicable manufacturer. We do not assume, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to obtain and include any information beyond that provided by the manufacturer. Although the FDA recognizes that the FD&C Act does not prohibit prescriber-authorized "off-label" uses of approved products, all of the Content is intended solely for the "on-label" use of any drug.
In addition to manufacturer-supplied, FDA-approved product label information, the PDR Websites, the PDR Applications and the Services may also display other Content that does not reflect FDA-approved language and/or that is prepared by PDR or its Suppliers, such as: (i) summaries of side effects, warnings, precautions, indications and efficacy of drug products, and (ii) articles and other literature describing, among other things, research findings and news about drug products. All such Content is subject to the notices, disclaimers, and limitations of liability set forth herein.
We reserve the right to remove any Content, no matter the source, at any time. We do not filter our Content or that of any Linked Site for viewing by children, and do not warrant that such information is appropriate for children.
