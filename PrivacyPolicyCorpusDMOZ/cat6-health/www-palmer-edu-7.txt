Palmer Clinic Doctors and Patients Share Their ExperiencesBack pain may be the most common reason patients seek the expertise of a chiropractor, but chiropractic techniques accomplish far more. They help patients with acute or chronic issues, including headaches, neck pain, sciatica and improper function of the nervous system that may result from car accidents, sports injuries, heredity and other causes.Because chiropractic healthcare is holistic care, patients look to chiropractors for general wellness, too. In fact, preventive healthcare is among the fastest growing areas of chiropractic care.Watch the videos below to see patients at the Palmer Chiropractic Clinics talk about how chiropractic can help people with a variety of health problems live healthier lives.
