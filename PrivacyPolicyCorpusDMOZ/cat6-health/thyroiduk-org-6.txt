Thyroid UK Support Network
Thyroid UK has a Support Network which consists of a mixture of local support groups; email support, telephone support and Facebook.
Some of the groups are our own groups, run by volunteers of Thyroid UK but other groups are independent groups that wanted to be listed along with ours to help people with thyroid and related diseases.
Going to a group gives you the opportunity to chat with others in the same position as yourselves. Some groups organise speakers but some just meet to chat. Some of the groups have their own newsletters.
The telephone and email Support Networkers are there to give you support and chat with you about your thyroid problems and answer your questions.
These Support Networkers cannot diagnose, or tell you which medication to take or how much. However, you can chat to them about your thyroid problems and they can tell you what worked for them.
The Support Network list is included in our Information Pack.  It is also available via email on request, please use our Support Network contact form.
Thyroid UK also has an online community where you can get information and support from like-minded people.
If you are interested in becoming a Support Networker for Thyroid UK please contact us.
Thyroid UK relies on donations so that we can continue to support and campaign for people with thyroid disease and related disorders.  If you have found our information helpful, please do think about donating or becoming a member.
