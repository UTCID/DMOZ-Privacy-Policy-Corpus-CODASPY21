Privacy and Security
Addressing privacy and confidentiality of personal health information is fundamental to all Infoway digital health initiatives.  All jurisdictions in Canada (federal, provincial, territorial) have laws in place to protect personal information, with many having laws specific to health information. These laws and best practices are respected by all Infoway funded projects.
Infoway is committed to respecting personal privacy, safeguarding confidential information, and ensuring the security of personal health information (PHI) within our custody or control.
Visit PrescribeIT.ca to view the PrescribeITTM Privacy Policy.
Infoway works closely with the provinces and territories to develop solutions that safeguard Canadians’ personal health information.
