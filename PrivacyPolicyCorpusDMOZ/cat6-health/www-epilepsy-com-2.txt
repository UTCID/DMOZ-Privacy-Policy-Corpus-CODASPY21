content highlights
Progress has been made in diagnosing and treating epilepsy, but discrimination unfortunately continues.
The Epilepsy Foundation's Jeanne A. Carpenter Epilepsy Legal Defense Fund fights epilepsy discrimination across all aspects of an individual's life, including work, school, and community life.
It accomplishes these goals through public education, increased access to legal services, and advocating for changes in discriminatory practices, policies, and laws.

Who We Are
People with seizures and epilepsy face discrimination in many aspects of life, including work, school, and community life.
If you are a person with epilepsy, family or friend, attorney, or advocate, get legal help and information here at the Jeanne A. Carpenter Epilepsy Legal Defense Fund.
Our Goals
To end epilepsy-related discrimination and injustice through public education
To increase access to legal services through a system of managed referrals to a network of attorneys
To change discriminatory practices, policies, and laws
Our Priorities
The Epilepsy Foundation's Jeanne A. Carpenter Epilepsy Legal Defense Fund fights epilepsy discrimination in:
Employment
Education
Public accommodations (such as camps, childcare facilities, stores, hotels, theaters, fitness clubs)
Programs and services, including police and first responder training
Housing
Insurance
Criminal justice concerns
How We Make a Difference
Great strides have been made in diagnosing and treating epilepsy, a neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Despite these advances, epilepsy continues to evoke negative stereotypes, fear and discrimination.
For example:
A man from New York was denied a job opportunity due to a blanket policy excluding applicants taking seizure medications.
A man from Indiana was arrested and charged with a criminal offense after a seizure
A child from Maryland was denied access to a camp because he needed a rescue medication for seizures.
The Epilepsy Defense Fund’s network attorneys have worked to resolve these types of discriminatory practices.
“Thank you for help setting a solid foundation for me and my lawyer to work with...please keep doing what you do. And thank you again for your hard work and support.-James S., consumer.
