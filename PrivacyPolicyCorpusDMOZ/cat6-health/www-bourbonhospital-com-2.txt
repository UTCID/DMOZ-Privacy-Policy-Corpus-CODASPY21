Safe for the Summer: Tips to Help You Stay Protected and Healthy While Enjoying the Season
July 1, 2020
With summer officially here, chances are you’re hoping to take advantage of the season’s many opportunities to get outside and enjoy nature. And while it’s important to remember that COVID-19 is still here and we should be doing everything we can to stop the spread of this virus, taking a break to get outside, soak up some vitamin D and enjoy a little fun in the sun can do a world of good for your physical and mental health. Whether you’re taking the family to a mountain cabin, having a picnic in the park or prioritizing some pool time, remember to take the steps to help keep you, your family and your community healthy and safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19, including:
Social distancing (staying six feet apart)
Wearing a mask or cloth face covering in public spaces to help protect others and yourself
Frequently washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds (or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol) and
Staying home if you’re feeling ill.
And keep in mind these handy tips and important precautions to help you beat the heat, savor the water and have a safe and healthy summer.
Heat Safety
Heat is the number one weather killer in the U.S., and overexposure to heat can be especially harmful for children and seniors. You can protect yourself and your family and be heat smart by:
Being aware of temperature and humidity levels and modifying your activity accordingly
Always using an SPF-15 or higher sunscreen that protects against both UV-A and UV-B rays
Wearing sunglasses when outside to protect your eyes from the sun’s rays
Limiting outdoor activities when temps are at their highest (typically mid-day)
Staying hydrated and drinking lots of low or no-sugar beverages (water is always best!)
Taking advantage of cooler areas outside
Heading indoors when the temps soar above 90
Avoiding enclosed places like cars or garages
NEVER leaving children or animals in a car unattended
Dressing for comfort, with loose-fitting, lightweight and light-colored clothing
Taking breaks when exercising
Limiting or avoiding adult beverages (alcohol can impair your body’s ability to self-regulate its temperature)
Water Safety
What’s cooler than a dip in the water on a hot day? Make safe waves with these timely tips:
Only swim in designated areas supervised by lifeguards
Always swim with a buddy
Never leave a child unattended near water or trust a child’s life to another child
Make sure young children and inexperienced swimmers wear U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets around water
Don’t play around drains and suction fittings in the pool
Always be cautious around natural bodies of water – currents and underwater hazards can make falling into the water dangerous
Wear a life jacket when boating (most boating fatalities occur from drowning)
Avoid alcohol use around pools and bodies of water
If you have a pool or hot tub, or live near a body of water, keep reach-and-throw equipment, a cell phone, life jackets and a first aid kit nearby.
Fireworks Safety
Summer is also fireworks season. With many fireworks shows being canceled this year due to the ongoing pandemic, you may be thinking of having some fireworks fun in your own backyard (if legally able to do so). Follow these guidelines to keep your focus on a safe time for all:
Never allow young children to play with or ignite fireworks
Ensure an adult is always present to supervise fireworks activities
Keep a bucket of water or hose close by in case of a fire
Avoid fireworks packaged in brown paper because this is often a signal of fireworks that are strictly for professional displays
Light fireworks one at a time, then move back quickly
Never place any part of your body directly over a fireworks device when lighting the fuse
Never point or throw fireworks at another person or carry fireworks in your pocket
Never shoot off fireworks in metal or glass containers
Never attempt to re-light or pick up fireworks that have not ignited fully
After fireworks complete their burning, douse the fireworks with water from a bucket or hose before discarding it, to prevent a trash fire
Following these helpful tips, taking the proper precautions and engaging in some thoughtful planning can go a long way towards helping you enjoy this season safely. Should you or anyone you’re with succumb to illness or injury, it’s important to seek proper medical attention immediately and – in cases of emergency – call 911.
