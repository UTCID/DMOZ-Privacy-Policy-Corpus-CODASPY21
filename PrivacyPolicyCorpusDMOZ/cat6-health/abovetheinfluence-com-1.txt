The AbovetheInfluence.com website (the “Site”) was created to help teens become more aware of and assess influences around them, including drugs. We take your privacy very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of this Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy.
1. COPPA
We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, to remain consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
2. INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT
The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. If you want to send us your comments, you will be asked to enter a nickname or handle.
If you choose to submit a request to the “Contact Us” submission page, we will request your e-mail address only for the purpose of responding. We do not store or share these e-mail addresses and it is not required that an email address be entered here.

While your name and your state of residence may be collected if you upload Materials to AbovetheInfluence.com, submissions that incorporate any personally identifiable information will be immediately removed from consideration for online posting.
Any company that helps manage this Site has signed an agreement indicating that they will only use the anonymous information collected in aggregate for the purposes for which they were hired.
We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served on us; (c) to protect or defend our legal rights or property, this Site, or its users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of the users of this Site or the general public.

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the online privacy guidelines of the White House Office of Management and Budget, we do not sell, share or rent any personally identifying information about you.

Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from these cookies and match such information with data provided by you or another party.
Abovetheinfluence.com uses 1st party anonymous, persistent cookies.

The type of browser and operating system used to access the Site;
The date and time you accessed the Site;
