The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for www.medsafetyofficer.org.

COOKIES
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your online shopping cart. The shopping cart may not perform correctly if the cookies option is turned off in the browser settings. The MSOS web site uses cookies to restrict access to some content. MSOS members who elect to browse the site with the cookies option turned off will not be able to access restricted content.
LOG FILES
Browser type, IP address, access time, and files accessed are collected in log files. MSOS uses this information to analyze traffic on the site and then discards the log files. Aggregate information generated from the log files is sometimes shared with advertisers.
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
The site collects personally identifiable information at the following locations: MSOS Membership, Change of Personal Information Form for MSOS Members, MSOS Shopping Cart, and Listserv sign-up. The information collected may include name, title, home address, business address, practice demographics, e-mail, and credit card number (when a purchase is made). We use customer contact information from the forms to send orders, email news services, newsletters, and event announcements. A credit card processing company is used to process credit card transactions. The credit card information is used only for billing purposes. The nonfinancial information we collect is sometimes shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. Users may choose to decline receiving future mailings; please see the "Opting Out" section below. Aggregated demographic information may also be compiled and shared, but does not identify the individual user.
