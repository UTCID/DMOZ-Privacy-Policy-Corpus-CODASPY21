Movement Disorders Care
Neurological movement disorders can affect your ability to walk, talk, and move. Living with a progressive movement disorder such as Parkinson’s disease can make everyday movements a struggle. You may also be worried about your future health as the disease progresses. At Allegheny Health Network (AHN) Neuroscience Institute, we help you get symptom relief and manage the condition long term.
Our movement disorder specialists are leaders in their fields. We’ve helped hundreds of patients live fuller, more active lives after administering an innovative treatment called deep brain stimulation surgery. At AHN, we provide access to comprehensive evaluation services and novel treatment options to help you manage your care.

Get precise movement disorders diagnosis at AHN
Movement disorders are often misdiagnosed because their symptoms can mirror those of many other conditions. AHN’s specialists have a thorough understanding of many different movement disorders. We use a range of diagnostic tools to evaluate your symptoms and provide a precise diagnosis. No single test can diagnose a movement disorder. After evaluating your symptoms, your doctor may recommend:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging tests, which can help physicians rule out conditions, such as a tumor, that might explain your symptoms
Blood or urine tests, which can tell us if there are unusual levels of blood cells, hormones or other substances that may be causing your symptoms
Neurological tests, which measure your muscle strength and reflexes
Get expert movement disorders treatment at AHN
After a comprehensive evaluation, we develop a thoughtful care plan that addresses your symptoms and challenges. AHN’s movement disorders care team is led by a network of board-certified neurologists, neurosurgeons, and rehab physicians who have years of experience treating complex movement disorders. Your treatment plan may change as the condition progresses or as your preferences change.
Treatment options include:
Medication: Your physician helps determine which medications and dosage would most benefit you, based on your symptoms and specific challenges.
Physical therapy: Certain exercises or activities may improve your symptoms. Regular activity can also benefit your health in many ways. Our knowledgeable, caring physical therapists work with you on a customized physical therapy plan.
Speech or occupational therapy: Our specially trained speech and occupational therapists can help you relearn how to complete daily activities that have become difficult.
Surgery: Neurosurgical procedures, such as deep brain stimulation, may be an option for you. Our specialists have performed hundreds of these innovative procedures, which involve surgically implanting electrodes into the brain to regulate impulses.
