The American Burn Association Web site contains general information for burn care professionals. The ABA Web site is not intended to respond to requests for medical information, and the ABA is unable to respond to requests regarding personal medical concerns related to burn injuries. Your physician is the best source for information related to initial treatment, ongoing care, and follow-up issues for burn injuries. If you do not have a physician, please contact the physician referral service at your local burn center or hospital.
