"Dr. Burgess is awesome! I would recommend her to anyone. I never write reviews but I was so compelled to write one about how good of an experience I had with her. I have been to several dermatologist before and nobody took as much time as she did to really figure out what was going on with my skin. She took her time, made me feel comfortable, and then gave me a thorough skin care regimen complete with samples! You can immediately pick up on how skilled and experienced she is!"
