Office & Financial Policies
Thank you for choosing Olympic Dermatology.
Thank you for choosing Olympic Dermatology & Laser Clinic.  We have set forth a few of our policies which we hope will guide you during your time with our office. We are committed to building a successful provider-patient relationship with you and your family.  Your clear understanding of our policies is important to our professional relationship.  Please ask if you have any questions about our fees, policies or your responsibilities.  It is your responsibility to notify our office of any patient information changes (i.e. address, name, insurance information, etc.).
“I have consistently good care at Olympic Dermatology. Caring, thorough treatment and the experience is always good.”
— Olympic Dermatology medical patient, January 2019
Appointments
Our office is open Monday through Saturday and appointments are scheduled between 8:30 AM – 4:45 PM.  We can be reached at (360) 459-1700.  Demand for our services is high and we do our best to answer all incoming phone calls, however it may be necessary to leave a voicemail.   Messages left after 4:00 PM will be returned the following business day.
Because we know your time is valuable, we do our best to stay on schedule.  Therefore, we ask new patients to arrive 20 minutes before their scheduled appointment.  Any patient arriving 10 minutes late may be asked to reschedule.  We understand there are circumstances beyond our control, which is why this will be decided on a case by case basis.
A pattern of no-shows, late cancellations or tardiness may result in discharge from the practice.
By supplying your home phone number, mobile phone number, email address, and any other personal contact information, you are authorizing Olympic Dermatology to employ a third-party automated outreach and messaging system to use your personal information, the name of your care provider, the time and place of your scheduled appointment(s), and other limited information, for the purpose of notifying you of a pending appointment, a missed appointment, overdue wellness exam, balances due, lab results, or any other healthcare related function. You are also authorizing Olympic Dermatology to disclose to third parties, who may intercept these messages, limited protected health information (PHI) regarding my healthcare events. You are consenting to receiving multiple messages per day from Olympic Dermatology, when necessary.  In addition, you are consenting to allowing detailed messages being left on my voice mail, answering system, or with another individual, if I am unavailable at the number provided by me.
Cancellation & Deposit Policy
We attempt to remind you of your appointments, but it is strictly a courtesy contact. We kindly request a 24-hour advance notice to reschedule or cancel any appointments. A $45.00 charge will be incurred for missed medical appointments. This charge is not covered by insurance.  Missed surgery appointments will incur a $75.00 fee, also not covered by insurance.
Due to demand and time requirements, cosmetic appointments require a $100.00 deposit.  Deposits are forfeited for a late cancellation or no show. If your deposit is included in a package, $100.00 will be owed at your next visit and we will collect at the time of service.  Packages are expected to be completed within one year of purchase, otherwise treatments will revert to individual pricing and a refund, if applicable, will be mailed to you.
Payments
Co-Pays and Deductibles
We do our best to inform you of your insurance benefits prior to your appointment. Patients are expected to present an insurance card at each visit.  All co-payments and deductibles are due at time of service, unless prior arrangements have been made with the Business Office.  We accept cash, check, debit and credit cards (American Express, Discover, MasterCard or Visa) as well as Care Credit.  Post-dated checks will not be accepted.  If you are unable to make payment, the appointment will be rescheduled.  Our Business Office always happy to prepare an estimate for you after your initial visit.
Returned Checks
The charge for a returned check is $40.  This will be applied to your account in addition to the insufficient funds amount.  You may be placed on a cash-only basis following any returned check. If insufficient funds are not paid within 15 days, the amount will be sent to collections.
Referrals and Preauthorizations
If your insurance company requires a referral and/or preauthorization, you are responsible for obtaining it.  We are available to assist you, but failure to obtain the referral and/or preauthorization may result in you being held responsible for the entire bill.
Financials
Balances that are not paid within 30 days of the first statement are subject to a .75% per month interest (9% APR). In the event of default of payment and/or failure to pay, you are responsible to pay the costs of collection including court costs and reasonable attorney fees to be determined by a court of law. Any unresolved claims will be pursued in the Thurston County court system.
Self-pay Accounts
Self-pay accounts are patients without insurance coverage, patients covered by insurance plans in which the office does not participate, or patients without an insurance card on file with us.  You will be expected to pay in full at the time of service and will receive a 25% discount. Certain insurance plans may not allow us to treat you as a self-pay patient for medical services rendered. If we are unable to see you at our office, we are happy to help you find another office that contracts with your insurance plan.
Statements
All balances due upon receipt of billing statement.  If you need to make payment arrangements, please contact the Business Office immediately.  We are happy to work with you. It is never our intention to cause hardship to our patients, only to provide them with the best care possible and the least amount of stress.  Please understand that paying in a timely fashion is required or you may be discharged from the Clinic.  Financial hardship will be considered should you meet the requirements.
Minors
The parent(s) or guardian(s) is responsible for full payment and will receive the billing statements.  A signed release to treat will be required for an unaccompanied minor.  Patients over the age of 18 are responsible for any balances due.
Prescriptions
Prescription Refills
We ask that all prescription refills be requested through your pharmacy.  Please allow 72 hours for us to process their request.  Our policy is not to renew any prescription for a patient who has not been seen in our office within the past year.  Some medications require more frequent monitoring.  If we require an appointment before a refill is approved, it is because we are trying to provide you with the best possible care.
In-House Prescription Refills
We request 24 hours’ notice for in-house prescription refills. The same prescription guidelines outlined above will be followed.
Pathology
If we take a biopsy, a sample of your tissue will be sent to a laboratory for processing. The lab will bill you a processing fee. There is also a pathology fee for examining the tissue that is charged by our office or an outside consultant.  Your insurance information will be forwarded to these other offices; however, they may not pay for these lab fees. If you insurance requires us to use a certain lab, it is your responsibility to inform our office before the specimen is sent. Pathology for cosmetic procedures will not be billed to insurance and will be your responsibility.
Again, thank you for choosing our office for your dermatological needs.  We value our patients and strive to deliver you with the best possible care! If you have any questions or concerns about our office policies, please call us at (360) 459-1700. We are always happy to assist!
