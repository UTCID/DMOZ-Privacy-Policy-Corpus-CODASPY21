Lymphedema
Lymphedema is the swelling of the legs or arms caused by the buildup of excess fluid. This can sometimes happen after heart or vascular surgery where lymph nodes become blocked or have been removed, though symptoms may not always appear right away. Lymphedema swelling can lead to feelings of heaviness or tightness, restricted range of motion, and aching or discomfort. It can also cause infections and the hardening or thickening of the skin.
Our certified lymphedema therapists offer treatments that can help reduce your pain and swelling and restore the range of motion of your limbs so you can get back to living your life. We offer a full range of lymphedema treatments, including:
Specialized massage to help promote drainage
Compression therapy
Personalized exercise programs designed to increase the flow of lymph fluid
Skin and nail care to help prevent infections
