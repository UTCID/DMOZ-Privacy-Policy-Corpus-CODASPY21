Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy:
Clear Heart Counseling ("Clear Heart Counseling")
operates clearheartcounseling.com and may operate other websites. It
is Clear Heart Counseling's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Clear Heart Counseling collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Clear Heart Counseling's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how Clear Heart Counseling's visitors use its website. From time to
time, Clear Heart Counseling may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Clear Heart Counseling also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on clearheartcounseling.com
blogs/sites. Clear Heart Counseling only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Clear Heart Counseling's websites choose to interact
with Clear Heart Counseling in ways that require Clear Heart Counseling to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Clear Heart Counseling gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at clearheartcounseling.com to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Clear Heart Counseling are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, Clear Heart Counseling collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
Clear Heart Counseling. Clear Heart Counseling does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Clear Heart Counseling may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. Clear Heart Counseling may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Clear Heart Counseling does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Clear Heart Counseling discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on Clear Heart Counseling's behalf or to provide services available
at Clear Heart Counseling's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using Clear Heart Counseling's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. Clear Heart Counseling will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Clear Heart Counseling discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when Clear Heart Counseling believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Clear Heart Counseling, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an Clear Heart Counseling website and have supplied your email address, Clear Heart Counseling
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with Clear Heart Counseling and our products. If you send us a request (for
example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Clear Heart Counseling takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
