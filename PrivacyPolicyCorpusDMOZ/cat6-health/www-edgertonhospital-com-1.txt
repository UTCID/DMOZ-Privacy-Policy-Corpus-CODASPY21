Notice of Privacy Practice
This Notice outlines your rights to the access and release of medical information regarding your care and treatment at Edgerton Hospital and Health Services. This information is provided in accordance with Federal regulations described in
R.S. 40:1299.96, 45 CFR 164.524 and 45 CFR 164.528.
Understanding Your Health Records and Information
A record of your visit is created each time you visit a hospital, physician or other healthcare provider. Typically, these records contain essential information about your care and treatment. They describe the reason for you visit, examination and test results, your medical history, any diagnoses and treatments, your plan of care and the ultimate disposition of your care. All of this information is usually referred to as you “medical records” or “health information.” Your medical record essentially serves as a:
Basis for planning your care and treatment.
Means of communication between the multiple health care professionals involved in your care and treatment.
Legal document describing the care provided and follow-up care needed.
Source of information required for use by public health officials to assess the effectiveness of providers and health care programs in the State.
Source of data for the hospital to assess its performance and plan for future service needs.
Source of data and statistics for use in medical research.
By law, hospitals, physicians and health care providers own the medical records they create and are held responsible for their storage and safekeeping in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws. While you have specific rights to the access and release of information concerning your personal medical records, you do not own them.
Please review our full Notice of Privacy Practice.
Requests for Information and Problem Reporting
If you have any questions regarding health information policies and practices, or you would like to report a problem, please contact our Health Information Office at 608-884-1625.
