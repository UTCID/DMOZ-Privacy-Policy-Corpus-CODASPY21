Frequently Asked Questions:
We regularly get asked questions about Panda Helper, and these are the most common ones:
How Do I Fix Untrusted Developer Error?
This is a standard error with third-party content and is simple to solve:
Open your Settings app and tap General
Tap on Profiles & Device Management
Tap the developer/app name in the list
Tap Trust and close settings.
The error should be cleared
Does Panda Helper Void My Warranty?
No, because it works in the same way as any regular app. Unlike Cydia, it doesn’t break security by hacking into the root of iOS. However, some of the tweaks can change your device functionality, and they can cause your warranty to be voided – just delete them if you ever have to take your device to a store for repair.
Panda Helper won’t Download Or Verify – What Happened?
This is down to the app certificate – the developers use expired enterprise certificates and while they do their best to keep replacing them, on occasion one will get missed, and Apple will revoke it. Just delete Panda Helper, wait for a few hours and install it again. The developers should have replaced the certificate by then, and it will work.
