3. Third Parties
We may share information about you with third parties as follows:
Advertisers: We may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Site to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as Good Gym Guide does for itself. They may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt-out of some of their practices. Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of advertisements to you.
Service Providers: Some of the services that are offered through the Site, such as free gym passes or free personal training sessions, may be provided by third-party providers. We also outsource some of Good Gym Guide’s functions to third-party providers, such as technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance, testing, payment processing functions, and other services. We may share information from or about you with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests.
Aggregate Information: We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements.
Business Transfers: We may share information from or about you with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honour this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Good Gym Guide or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Businesses on Good Gym Guide: We may share information from or about you (such as your age and gender) and your use of the Site (such as which businesses you bookmark or call) with businesses on Good Gym Guide.

This information personalises your experience and helps you create a Good Gym Guide account. You can also connect your Good Gym Guide account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook or Twitter, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service. We use the information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers. You can manage these settings here.
4. Controlling Your Personal Data
Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Site.
Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that both you and the sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your messages publicly posts it or its contents. Similarly, Good Gym Guide may also access such messages in the course of investigations relating to Site use.
5. Data Retention and Account Termination
You can close your account by clicking here. We will remove your public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorised under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings, ratings or reviews by closing their accounts.
6. Children
The Site is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 14. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 14. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us here. If we become aware that a child under 14 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.
7. Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

9. Jurisdiction
The information we obtain from or about you may be processed and stored in Australia, which may provide for different data protection rules than the country in which you reside. We comply with The Privacy Act as set forth by the Australian Government regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the Commonwealth of Australia.
