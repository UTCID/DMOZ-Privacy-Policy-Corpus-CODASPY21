You can save lives by donating your extra breast milk for use as pasteurized donor human milk. Your breast milk contribution will have a big impact, as a premature infant eats as little as one ounce or less in a single feeding.
Exclusive human milk feeding significantly reduces the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, a leading cause for prematurity-related death, and contributes to the overall wellbeing of medically fragile infants.
To get screened as a milk donor, call one of our 30 nonprofit member milk banks. They will interview you by phone, advise what you need from your doctor, and require a blood test through a lab they identify.
Lab tests and shipping will be provided at no cost to you. Once approved as a screened milk donor, you will then be able to donate milk.
Get started today. Call the HMBANA member milk bank of your choice!
