If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent the following information:
An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
Identification of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site or Service reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number and, if available, your email address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law;
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Our Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached as follows: Designated Agent: Alan Shapiro; Address of Agent: 345 Hudson Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10014; Telephone: (646) 728-9500; Fax: (646) 728-9501; E-mail for notice: DMCA@everydayhealthinc.com.
