Military & Military Families
Advertisement
Since October 2001, about 1.6 million U.S. troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
These military members and their families face unique challenges. Soldiers deal with stressors in combat that may not exist in civilian life.
Those exposed to high levels of combat are significantly more likely to experience acute stress and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Learn more facts.
It is not unusual for servicemen and women to suffer feelings of fear, anger, sadness, and worry when returning from deployment. Adjusting to family life can be difficult for everyone. Get tips for soldiers and veterans and families and friends.
Mental pain can be as serious as physical pain, however, and help is available for active and veteran military members and their families. Learn what treatments work and where to find help.
Watch a video of a Staff Sgt. Stacy Pearsall, a combat photographer who experienced PTSD. See how she got help.
The Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital Home Base Program provides clinical care and support services to Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in New England who experience combat stress or traumatic brain injury. Home Base also provides counseling for families, including spouses, parents, children, and siblings.
BraveHeart: Welcome Back Veterans Southeast Initiative — Our mission is focused on helping people in the Southeastern United States get help for PTSD. Emory University and the Atlanta Braves have teamed up to offer veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their family members a variety of expert support resources.
