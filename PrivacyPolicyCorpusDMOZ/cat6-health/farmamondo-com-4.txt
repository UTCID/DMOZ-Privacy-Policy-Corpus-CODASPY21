Who We Help
PHARMA AND BIOTECH
We help pharmaceutical and biotech companies to commercially launch their medicines by adding  insight, expertise and value at every stage of a medicine’s lifecycle through FarmaMondo Named Patient and Commercialization services.
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS
Global Healthcare providers facing patient unmet needs due to lack of licensed and commercially available therapies in their home countries can rely on FarmaMondo to understand the local regulations, their requirements and expectations in sourcing an unlicensed medicine. Physicians, Hospitals, Clinics and pharmacies looking to gain access to unlicensed and our licensed medicines should contact FarmaMondo.
Hospital pharmacists’ work is a never ending challenge.
086%of EU hospital pharmacists report medicine shortages as a problem075%hold that medicine shortages have in fact a negative impact on patient care.
FarmaMondo understands your needs and expectations in addressing your hospital shortages; we realize the urgency, we are aware of the applicable regulatory routes, we fit to the all common procurement mechanisms and administrative procedures applied to unlicensed medicines. Contact FarmaMondo to overcome product shortages your hospital is facing.
INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS
According to the applicable regulations related to the supply of medicines, all requests for access to medicines must come from a healthcare provider. The FarmaMondo group includes Farmacia Centrale, a Swiss international dispensing pharmacy serving patients with valid prescriptions.
Please contact: farmaciacentrale@farmamondo.com
Alternatively, if you are a patient or are visiting this site on behalf of a patient who suffers from an unmet medical need, please contact your healthcare provider (Doctor, Pharmacist, Hospital). FarmaMondo, once contacted by your healthcare provider, will discuss the access options of a requested therapy.
PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS
Unlicensed medicine access routes might be the only option for a patient with unmet medical needs when no other therapy is available in its home country. Through a joint effort, Patient advocacy groups and FarmaMondo can raise awareness to such unmet needs and eventually formalizing a Managed Access Program to meet those needs. Patient advocacy groups can play a critical role as a trusted resource for their patients, providing timely and accurate information about the process for accessing unlicensed medicines.
