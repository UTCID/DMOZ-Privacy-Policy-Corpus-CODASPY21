Introduction.

It also describes your rights to access and control your protected health information.
Protected health information (PHI) is information about you, including demographic information, that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health condition and related health care services. II.

Please note, however, that we are not required to agree to a restriction that you may request.
If we believe it is in your best interest to permit use and disclosure of your health information, we will notify you that your request for restriction will not be honored.

Examples of How We Will Use or Disclose Your Protected Health Information (PHI). The following are examples of the types of uses and disclosures of
your PHI that we are permitted to make. Treatment:
We will use and disclose PHI to provide, coordinate or manage your health care and any related services. For example, we may disclose PHI to your primary care physician who referred you to us, to other physicians who may be involved in your health care, and/or to a physician to whom you have been referred for further management of your health care. In addition, we may disclose PHI to other health care facilities, such as your local hospital, to coordinate diagnostic testing or surgery, or to a physical therapy or home health agency to coordinate your follow-up care. Payment:
PHI will be used as needed to obtain payment for services that we provide to you. For example, we may disclose PHI to your health insurance company and its representatives for reimbursement purposes and to determine eligibility for services such as office visits, diagnostic studies, surgery, etc. Healthcare Operations:
We may use or disclose your PHI as needed to support our own business activities.
These activities may include quality assessment, training and supervision of staff members, or other business activities. For example, we may share your PHI with third party business associates that perform various services that are essential to the operations of our organization, such as billing services. We will limit the amount of PHI that we provide to the minimum necessary to accomplish the particular task and we will have a written contract that contains terms that will protect the privacy of your PHI.
