City of Grande Prairie Page 9 of 43 Land Use Bylaw C-1260
Section 38 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
Principles
38.1 All existing and proposed developments in the City of Grande Prairie are encouraged to consider
incorporating as many of the 14 CPTED principles as possible.
38.2 The CPTED principles include the following:
a. Territoriality is the concept of creating and fostering places that are adopted by the
legitimate users of the space (i.e. they take ownership), making it less likely for people
who do not belong to engage in criminal or nuisance behaviour at that location. This can
be achieved by clearly marking public, private, and semi-public areas through landscaping.
It can be achieved through signage, by having residents beautify an area with their own
street art, or by restaurant owners extending their eating areas onto streets with tables
and chairs;
b. Natural Surveillance is the concept of putting “eyes on the street,” making a place
unattractive for offenders who wish to commit crime with impunity. Creating clear
sightlines through street design, landscaping, lighting, and site design (i.e. neighbourhood
layout) optimizes the potential for natural surveillance. Note that this is different from
organized surveillance (security patrols) and mechanical surveillance (closed circuit
television), which may ultimately be required in some places, however, ideally natural
surveillance should make them unnecessary;
c. Access Control refers to controlling who goes in and out of a neighbourhood, park,
building, and other places. Access control includes focusing on formal and informal entry
and exit points in buildings or parking areas (fencing, access gates) and signifying
entranceways to parks and neighbourhoods (hedging and other types of landscaping or
design);
d. Image refers to the appearance of a place and how this is instrumental in creating a sense
of place or territoriality for legitimate users of the space. A place that does not appear to
be maintained or cared for may indicate to criminals that property owners and legitimate
users of that place tolerate criminal activity. Regular clean-ups, graffiti vandalism removal,
and litter pickup are a few ways to enhance image;
e. Conflicting User Groups refers to instances where different user groups may conflict (e.g. a
school near industrial development or a seniors’ centre near a nightclub). Careful
consideration and a risk assessment of compatible land uses during the planning and siting
of facilities will minimize potential conflicts between groups before they become a
problem;
f. Activity Support is the concept of filling an area with legitimate users (by facilitating and
scheduling activities or events like sporting events, street music festivals, or sales kiosks)
to decrease opportunities of offending with impunity. Places and facilities that are
underused can become locations with the potential for criminal activity;
g. Crime Generators are areas that may generate activities that facilitate crime. For example,
24 hour convenience or liquor stores are legitimate commercial activities. They are not
problems in themselves, but their location in the community may cause conflict or
unforeseen secondary activity such as late night loitering and may become ideal places for
evening robberies;
City of Grande Prairie Page 10 of 43 Land Use Bylaw C-1260
h. Land Use Mix is the concept that diversity in land uses can contribute to or detract from
crime opportunities. Totally separating land uses (e.g. residential and commercial) from
each other can create places that are unused during certain times of the day. However,
careful transition between some land uses is critical to ensuring an activity does not
increase the opportunities for crime to occur or reduce users’ and residents’ perceptions
of their safety in the area. Careful consideration of land uses within a development but
also of the surrounding land uses will reduce the opportunity for crime to occur and
increase feelings of safety in the area;
i. Movement Predictors direct people, especially pedestrians and cyclists, along a particular
route or path. In some cases, they do this without providing obvious alternative escape
routes or strategies for safety, as in a pedestrian tunnel or overpass. In other cases, they
merely direct people in a certain direction, what designers called wayfinding. It is
important to carefully design and situate movement predictors so as not to provide
potential attackers with places to lie in wait for people on a certain path;
j. Displacement in the CPTED context refers to the movement of crime in time or space and
what the impact may be. Displacement includes negative displacement (crime movement
makes things worse), diffusion of benefits (displacement can reduce the impact of crimes
more widely than expected), and positive displacement (opportunities for crime are
intentionally displaced which minimizes the impact of the crime);
k. Cohesion is the supportive relationships and interactions between all users of a place to
support and maintain a sense of safety. Though not a specific urban design function,
design can enhance the opportunity for positive social cohesion by providing well-
designed and carefully located spaces where this can occur, such as activity rooms, park
gazebos, or multi-purpose rooms in schools and community centres. In some cases
property owners or building managers can provide opportunities for social programming.
This will increase the ability of local residents or users of a space to positively address
issues as they arise;
l. Connectivity refers to the social and physical relationships external to the site itself. It
recognizes that any given place should not operate in isolation from surrounding
neighbourhoods and instead appreciate its relationship to the whole city. Areas that
isolate themselves often result in the Not-In-My-Backyard syndrome. Physical features
that help accomplish this are walkways and roadways connecting a particular land use to
the surrounding neighbourhoods or features such as centrally located community centres
or program offices that provide services to a wider community;
m. Capacity is the ability for any given space or neighbourhood to support its intended use.
For example, excessive numbers of similar land uses in too small an area, such as
abandoned buildings or bars, can create opportunities for crime. Capacity refers to a
balance of uses with a full range of services for local residents to allow them to shop,
enjoy recreational activities, and live in the same geographical area. This is not only good
environmental sense as it cuts down on long distance auto travel, it also makes a
neighbourhood more interesting and therefore increases the likelihood local residents will
be proud to live there;
City of Grande Prairie Page 11 of 43 Land Use Bylaw C-1260
n. Culture refers to the overall cultural expression of a place. Also known as “place making,”
this process involves artistic, musical, sports, or other local cultural events designed to
bring people together and enhance social cohesion. Physical designs that can encourage
this include public multi-purpose facilities, buildings and expressions of faith, sports
facilities, and areas that local artists and musicians might use. Community memorials,
public murals, neighbourhood branding, and other cultural features also enhance this.
Pre-existing cultural features that create a distinct identity for a place can be used to
determine the design principles and policies that best support the cohesiveness and well-
being of all groups living and working there.

intersection, and a third side the length of which is a straight line connecting the two (2)
points along the said boundaries; or,
b. If the corner lot is at the intersection of a lane and a street in a Residential District, or if a
corner lot is located in a commercial or industrial district, a visibility triangle is comprised
of two (2) sides which are 3.0m long, as measured from the corner of the corner lot along
the boundaries of the lot which meet at the said intersection, and a third side the length
of which is a straight line connecting the two (2) points along the said boundaries.
39.3 Unless otherwise permitted in this Bylaw, the minimum setbacks on a Corner Lot shall be as
follows:

Section 54 Radiocommunication and Broadcasting Antenna Facility
54.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to establish a procedure and recommended standards where a
telecommunication carrier is required to consult with The City for the siting of a new antenna
system, or alteration of an existing system, that is regulated by Industry Canada.
54.2 Requirement to Consult with the City of Grande Prairie
Industry Canada’s Client Procedures Circular CPC-2-0-03 “Radiocommunication and

impact the High Visibility Corridor. The proposed placement should also minimise any
impact on the natural environment;
d. Where a new tower or mast is proposed for an antenna system, the City encourages the
use of monopole design to reduce the visual impact of the structure and supports the use
of camouflage techniques that will assist blend the tower and associated structures into
the surrounding built and natural environment;
e. Where antennae and/or utility shelters are proposed on the roof of an existing building,
they should be set back from the edge of roof line in order to minimise the visual impact
from ground level;
f. No signage, other than signage required for regulatory or safety purposes should be
mounted on a telecommunication tower;
g. The City encourages the use of protective anti climb fencing around new masts or towers.
54.4 Application Submission Requirements
When a proponent is required to consult with the City regarding a telecommunication facility,
the proponent shall submit the applicable fee to the Development Authority, together with an
information package, which shall include:
a. Written documentation of attempts to co-locate on existing antenna supporting
structures within the City, including building rooftops and responses received from

mailed a notification package containing the applicant’s proposal, the City encourages the
applicant to also arrange an open house in order to engage the surrounding landowners in
the consultation process to the greatest extent possible;
c. The Development Officer will require a public consultation summary from the applicant
prior to submitting a report to the City’s Committee. The summary shall include a list of
property owners notified, responses received and the applicant’s measures taken to
address any reasonable and relevant concerns received; and
