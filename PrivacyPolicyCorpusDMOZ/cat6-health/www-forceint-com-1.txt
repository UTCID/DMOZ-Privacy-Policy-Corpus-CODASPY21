The license granted to you is subject to the following restrictions. You

in any way modify, alter, or create derivative works from the

other means; or
otherwise use or access this Site, its contents, or any connected

Terms or in violation of any law.
Areas of the Site may have different terms of use posted. If there is a
conflict between these Terms and terms of use posted for a specific area

of that area of the Site.
Classes & Fees
Fees for each class are posted on the Site. Fees are due in advance and
are nonrefundable and noncancelable, except that we will refund fees for
courses cancelled by us after you have enrolled. Fees do not include any
applicable sales, excise, or other taxes.
Our classes, and their prices and details, are subject to change or
discontinuance without notice. While we make every effort to provide
accurate information, we make no representation as to the completeness,
accuracy, or currency of any information on the Site, and we will not be
liable for any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions. We reserve the right
to limit or cancel quantities, or to refuse any order, in our sole
discretion.

To access classes or other content on the Site, you may be asked to
provide certain registration details or other information. All the

complete. If you choose, or you are provided with, a user name,
password, or any other key or tool as part of our security procedures,
you must treat such information as confidential and not disclose it to
any third party. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized
use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You
must log out from your account at the end of each session. You should
use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or
shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your
password or other personal information. We reserve the right to block
access or terminate any account of any user who, in our discretion,
violates these Terms.
Third-Party Content
The Site may include access to content created, owned, or controlled by
third parties. The site may also link to third parties’ websites. While
we may make these available to you, they are not under our control and
we are not responsible for their content nor do we guaranty their
accuracy or availability to you. You understand that you bear all risk
associated with such third-party content or websites, and that you may
be required to agree to such third parties’ terms and conditions in
order to use or access their content or websites. Accordingly, we
encourage you to review the terms of use and privacy policies, if any,
associated with third-party content or websites.
User-Submitted Content
The Site may include interactive portions in which you and other users
may submit posts, comments, messages, images, audio or visual content,
reviews, links, favorites, or the like to be made publically available
on our site or to other users (as the case may be). You remain
responsible and liable for any content you submit to our site. Do not
submit any content that is offensive, threatening, harmful, infringing
of another’s proprietary rights, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable.
We are not responsible for content posted by anyone other than us,
including content that violate these Terms, and you browse such portions
of our site at your own risk. Nevertheless, we will try to monitor and
moderate user submissions, and we have the right (but not any
obligation) to remove any content that, in our discretion, does not meet
our standards or violates any of our Terms or policies, or to block
access or terminate any account of any user who submits such content or
who otherwise violates these Terms. Please report any such content to
us, including but not limited to content that you believe may infringe
your or another’s copyright, at the contact information listed below.
For any content you submit to or using any portion of our Site, or
communicate to us in any way (except confidential payment information
necessary to place orders), you agree to grant us (or warrant that the
owner of such rights has granted us) a unrestricted nonexclusive,
perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide right and
license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, publish, publicly
display, publically perform, transmit, and distribute such content in
any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed, without
further compensation, consideration, attribution, or notice. You also
warrant (or warrant on behalf of the owner of such rights) that all
confidentiality and moral rights in the content have been waived. You
agree to defend us and hold us harmless from any liability, loss,
expense, or claim by a third party, including reasonable attorney fees,
arising out of your breach of these Terms, your use of the Site or its
products and services, content you submit, your practice of medicine or
dentistry, or any violation of the rights of another.
