PATIENT CONSULTATION AND CONSENT
All consultations will include a full medical history and patients are advised to bring any medication with them so we can assess suitability of treatment. Consultations are conducted in private in a treatment room with a qualified member of staff.
The Clinic will issue a consent form for the patient to read, understand and sign prior to proceeding with any treatment. We will also seek the patients consent for taking photographs of the area of treatment for comparison purposes.
A contract for treatment will be established between the patient and the Clinic upon signing the appropriate consent form. Terms and conditions will be fully explained and agreed prior to any treatment taking place.
Depending on the outcome of the consent and first consultation, the Clinic may take a view to not proceed with any treatment and may recommend another form of treatment for the patient or refer them elsewhere.
TREATMENT COST
For an estimate on how much a treatment may cost, we recommend that you contact the Clinic for our latest prices and special offers. For specific information based on your individual needs, we will be happy to arrange a no-obligation consultation. Our Online Pricelist also provides a general guide to treatment pricing.
Please note that there is a charge for some consultations. This will be advised upon booking.
PATIENT DIGNITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
This Clinic has a policy of patient confidentiality and all information and records are kept safe and confidential. The privacy and dignity of patients is respected at all times.
Any discussion between patients and staff regarding their treatment / potential treatment take place behind closed doors. All consultations with patients are carried out in person by qualified personnel in the privacy of the consultation/treatment room.
Records of all consultation and treatments are kept securely in the patients notes.
