Our receptionists can be reached on either 01491 873 989 or 0118 958 2016 and will be happy to assist you in making an appointment. You can also contact us online to request an appointment here.
PATIENT CONSULTATION AND CONSENT
All consultations will include a full medical history and patients are advised to bring any medication with them so we can assess suitability of treatment. Consultations are conducted in private in a treatment room with a qualified member of staff.
The Clinic will issue a consent form for the patient to read, understand and sign prior to proceeding with any treatment. We will also seek the patient’s consent for taking photographs of the area of treatment for comparison purposes.
A contract for treatment will be established between the patient and the Clinic upon signing the appropriate consent form. Terms and conditions will be fully explained and agreed prior to any treatment taking place.
Depending on the outcome of the consent and first consultation, the Clinic may take a view to not proceed with any treatment and may recommend another form of treatment for the patient or refer them elsewhere.
TREATMENT COST
For an estimate on how much a treatment may cost, we recommend that you contact the Clinic for our latest prices and special offers. For specific information based on your individual needs, we will be happy to arrange a no-obligation consultation. Our Online Pricelist also provides a general guide to treatment pricing.
Please note that there is a charge for some consultations. This will be advised upon booking.
PATIENT DIGNITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
This Clinic has a policy of patient confidentiality and all information and records are kept safe and confidential. The privacy and dignity of patients is respected at all times.
Any discussion between patients and staff regarding their treatment / potential treatment take place behind closed doors. All consultations with patients are carried out in person by qualified personnel in the privacy of the consultation/treatment room.
Records of all consultation and treatments are kept securely in the patient’s notes.
Patient CHAPERONE AND ACCOMPANYING POLICY
The Clinic encourages the concept of patient chaperones within reasonable boundaries. If a patient brings a chaperone (e.g. next of kin or friend) or requests a member of staff (within reason) to accompany them, the following conditions apply:
There must be a mutual agreement between the patient and chaperone for the chaperone to be present;
The chaperone must have the ability and mental capacity to act as a chaperone;
The patient must introduce the chaperone to staff and explain their presence;
The chaperone must maintain confidentiality and comply with the Clinic’s policies;

The member of staff in charge of the case will make the final decision regarding presence of the chaperone.

We treat children or young persons in accordance with our Consent Policy. Patients under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, who will also sign any consent forms on the child’s behalf.
A medical referral (a letter from the patient’s general practitioner) is required for persons under the age of 12 for laser hair reduction / removal.
A medical referral (a letter from the patient’s general practitioner) is required for persons under the age of 16 for laser treatment, minor surgery and treatment of acne.
We do not permit children to be brought to the Clinic who are not undergoing treatment and cannot accept responsibility for any children while adults are receiving treatment. All such incidents should necessitate a rescheduling of the patient’s appointment. It is not acceptable for members of staff to child mind while parents are receiving treatment.
ACCESS TO HEALTH RECORDS
Patients have the right access to their records at the Clinic in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Freedom of Information Act.  If you require access to your records, please contact the Clinic Manager, who will discuss the issue with you and agree on the level of information to which you require access.

We use these to inform and improve the provision of treatment and care of prospective patients. Results are available to patients to view and to the CQC upon request and/or inspection visits.
CANCELLATIONS AND FAILURE TO ARRIVE AT SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS
Cancellations should be made by phone, email or in person at least 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment to avoid a charge being levied.
