About Nutrition Data
Site Navigation and Operation:
Q:
I want to find foods low in certain nutrients and high in others. How can I do that?
A:
Try using Nutrition Data's Nutrient Search Tool. First select the category of food that you're interested in (e.g., Beef Products), then select the desired nutrient from the highest in or lowest in options. This will display a list of foods that may be better choices than the ones you're currently consuming. You may also want to perform a reverse search to learn which foods to avoid. This process will slowly but surely sharpen your nutritional knowledge.
Q:
What's the best way for me to compare two different foods?
A:
We recommend that you compare their nutrient densities (i.e., the nutrient levels in a fixed caloric portion of each food). In general, higher nutrient densities are better, but look for lower values on the nutrients that most Americans overconsume: saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
Nutrient density is shown in a chart on each food's Nutrition Facts page. Nutrition Data also has a Food Comparison Tool that shows side-by-side values for multiple foods. For details, please see the Food Comparison Help page.
Q:
How did you choose the 50 Most Popular Foods?
A:
We didn't! Nutrition Data's 50 Most Popular Foods reflect the frequency with which actual foods are viewed by you and other visitors to the site. This popularity data is updated regularly.
Q:
Is Nutrition Data available offline or in a software version?
A:
Nutrition Data is an online tool that you can access from any computer with an Internet connection. There is no software version of Nutrition Data.
Q:
Is there a way to use Nutrition Data to analyze my total daily intake?
A:
Yes, the My Tracking area makes this easy. Please see our discussion of this topic on the My Tracking Help page.
Q:
How many total foods can I add to My Foods?
A:
You can store an unlimited number of foods in the My Foods area.
Q:
Where can I get a list of ingredients for my favorite food?
A:
Nutrition Data provides complete nutrient information for a wide range of foods. If you need a list of specific ingredients, you should contact the manufacturer or restaurant that makes the food. Most companies provide contact information on their Web sites.
Q:
Where can I find information on where to buy specific products and foods?
A:
Due to the complexity and changeability of this information, Nutrition Data does not keep a database of distributors or manufacturers. Please contact the company in question for this information.
Q:
How can I calculate my BMI and get Daily Value recommendations?
A:
To calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and recommended minimum daily needs, use our Daily Needs Calculator. Once you've determined your daily needs, click on the link above your recommended minimums to save your daily needs values to your preferences (if you are not already registered, you will be prompted to sign up for a free Nutrition Data account to save and adjust your preferences).
Q:
What is the Caloric Ratio Pyramid™ that appears in your analysis?
A:
The Caloric Ratio Pyramid™ is a symbol that was developed by Nutrition Data to graphically communicate information about the amount of carbohydrates, fats, and protein contained in a food. This special symbol is part of the nutritional summary that appears at the top of each nutritional analysis page. For a detailed explanation of how to interpret the Caloric Ratio Pyramid™, please see the Nutrition Facts Help page. To search for foods with a specific caloric ratio, check out our Food Category Explorer and click on the pyramid.
Q:
What is the Nutritional Target Map™ that appears in your analysis?
A:
The Nutritional Target Map™ allows you to see at a glance how foods line up with your nutritional and weight-management goals. The closer a food is to the right edge of the map, the more essential nutrients per calorie it contains. For a more nutritious diet, select foods that fall on the right half of the map.
Read more about the Nutritional Target Map™. To search for foods with a specific profile on the Nutritional Target Map™, check out our Food Category Explorer and click on the Nutritional Target Map™.
Q:
What is the Protein Quality Indicator™ that appears in your analysis?
A:
Protein Quality is dependent on having all the essential amino acids in the proper proportions. If one or more amino acid is not present in sufficient amounts, the protein in your diet is considered incomplete. Each spoke on the Protein Quality graph represents one of the nine essential amino acids, and the graph shows how close the protein in your diet is to the optimal distribution of amino acids recommended by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board.
An Amino Acid Score of 100 or higher indicates a complete or high-quality protein. If the Amino Acid Score is less than 100, a link is provided to complementary sources of protein. By combining complementary proteins, you may be able to increase the overall quality of the protein you consume.
Read more about Protein Quality.
Q:
What is the Nutrient Balance Indicator™?
A:
This symbol offers a visual representation of a food's nutritional strengths and weaknesses, with each spoke representing a different nutrient. The spoke for dietary fiber is colored green, protein is blue, vitamins are purple, minerals are white, and yellow represents a group of commonly overconsumed nutrients: saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
A Completeness Score™ between 0 and 100 is a relative indication of how complete the food is with respect to these nutrients. Although few (if any) individual foods provide all the essential nutrients, the Nutrient Balance Indicator™ and Completeness Score™ can help you construct meals that are nutritionally balanced and complete.
Read more about the Nutrient Balance Indicator™.
Q:
Why isn't my favorite fast-food restaurant on your restaurant list?
A:
Not all restaurants are willing to provide nutritional data on their foods, and, in some cases, the data that's currently available is not complete enough to meet Nutrition Data's standards. Please be patient, though. We are continuously evaluating new information for addition to our database. More restaurants will be added in the future.
Q:
What if the food I'm looking for isn't in your database?
A:
First, use our Search Tips page to optimize your searches. If that still doesn't help and you know the food's main ingredients, you can "build" it as a recipe using the My Recipe area. For details on how to do this, please see the My ND Help page.
Alternatively, if you have the food's Nutrition Facts label, you can enter the nutrient data yourself using our Custom Entry Tool. This tool allows you to enter all of the nutrients and is a great way to examine specialty foods that don't appear in our database.
Q:
When I'm searching for a food, what should I do if I don't know how to spell its name?
A:
If you can spell a portion of the name, then enter that, and Nutrition Data's search engine will search for it. For more information, please see Nutrition Data's Search Tips.

Data
Q:
How accurate is your food composition data?
A:
Nutrition Data obtains food composition data from a variety of published and unpublished sources, with the largest provider of data being the USDA. While Nutrition Data cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, we do our best to check or verify all data entries. For your reference, we also identify the data source for each individual food in the Footnotes section of every Nutrition Data analysis.
Q:
In your Nutrition Facts, why are there tildes (~) in place of some nutrient values?
A:
As mentioned in the Nutrition Facts footnotes, this mark indicates a value that is missing or incomplete. We mark it this way to differentiate it from zero. In other words, the food may contain some amount of that nutrient; however, the data provider either did not measure it or did not provide that data to Nutrition Data.
Q:
Can I recommend new foods for you to add to your database?
A:
In order to maintain a high level of quality, Nutrition Data currently accepts data submissions only from food manufacturers and restaurant chains, but we do appreciate your feedback. We are working to expand our content as quickly as possible.
Q:
Why don't your Nutrition Facts include levels of Trans Fats?
A:
They do! You'll find a line for "Total Trans Fats" near the bottom of the "Fats and Fatty Acids" table in the "Nutrition Information" section of our analysis. However, we don't yet have trans fat data for most foods in our system. Our data is provided by the USDA, restaurants, and food manufacturers, and they are just starting to effectively measure and report this data. The FDA established a new labeling standard in January 2006 to ensure food providers report on trans fat data on their labels. We are working to include this information on Nutrition Data as quickly as possible.
Q:
How current is your data? How do Nutrition Fact updates affect me?
A:
We updated our data on January 6, 2009, to reflect the USDA's most recent release of new food composition data (SR21).
A number of new foods have been added to the database and nutrient values have been updated for many foods.
Serving sizes for some foods (such as conversions from weight to volume measures) have been removed or updated.
In addition, a small number of foods have been removed from the database because they are no longer commercially available or nutritional information does not reflect current market data.
If you have saved foods (or recipes containing foods) in My ND that have been deleted from the database, they have been tagged as "obsolete." You can replace them with a similar non-obsolete item for correct recipe analysis.
If you have recipes using foods for which serving sizes have been corrected, the recipe analysis will now reflect the correct values. If the serving size you selected has been deleted from the database, the analysis will use the next closest serving size.
More details on what's been added and changed with the SR21 update are available on the Nutrition Data Blog.

Q:
When I try to print Nutrition Facts, it doesn't print well. How can I fix this?
A:
Our Nutrition Facts are presented using a combination of Flash and background images.
This can pose some challenges when printing.
If you are having problems printing, here are some solutions to try:
Enable the option to print background images in your browser.
For Firefox, select File from your browser menu, then Page Setup, then Format & Options.
We apologize for the inconvenience, but Firefox on the Macintosh is currently not supported for printing Flash and background images.
For Internet Explorer, select Tools from your browser menu, then Internet Options, then Advanced, then Printing.
For Safari, look for the Copies & Pages drop-down menu in your Print window and then choose "Safari."
If you have Internet Explorer 7, you will also need to adjust the default "Shrink to Fit" setting. IE 7 is known to resize the page automatically, which causes the images on Nutrition Data's analysis to distort.
Q:
How do I add NutritionData.com to my list of Trusted Sites in Internet Explorer?
A:
Go to Tools > Internet Options and click on the Security tab
Click on Trusted Sites and set the security level for this zone to Default Level by clicking the Default Level button or set to Low, Medium-Low, or Medium by clicking on the slider.
Click on "Sites" under Trusted Sites LC zone.
Uncheck the Require Server Verification box and type http://www.nutritiondata.com in the window labeled Add This Web Site to the Zone.
Then click on the Add button.
Click on OK and OK under Internet Options. Clear your browser cache and restart your browser by closing all open windows.

Nutrition
For additional answers to your nutrition questions, remember to check out the Nutrition Data Blog, and especially the Q&A section.
Q:
What are the differences among fatty acids, and which ones are omega-3s?
A:
The basic format used for describing the individual fatty acids is that the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid molecule and the number after the colon indicates the number of double bonds. Omega-3 and omega-6 isomers are denoted by n-3 and n-6. For more information, including a table that lists common names for many of the fatty acids, please see Nutrition Data's Fatty Acids page.
Q:
I found the food I was looking for, but how do I know how cooking or processing will affect it?
A:
Nearly every food preparation process reduces the amount of nutrients in food. In particular, processes that expose foods to high levels of heat, light, and/or oxygen cause the greatest nutrient loss. Nutrients can also be "washed out" of foods by fluids introduced during cooking. For more information, see our page on Nutritional Effects of Food Processing.
Q:
I need to lose/gain weight. How many calories should I eat?
A:
Use our Daily Needs Calculator to estimate the number of calories needed to maintain your current weight.
To lose one pound a week, eat 500 fewer calories per day than your maintenance level. To gain one pound a week, eat 500 more calories per day than your maintenance level.
