Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)
On January 1, 2012, Ontario hospitals become subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).
The purpose of FIPPA is to provide the general public with a right of access to information held by institutions, while protecting the privacy of individuals whose personal information is held by institutions.
LHSC is embracing this Act; we believe in transparency and accountability. We will encourage and support proactive disclosure where it is appropriate – actively providing information and documents online that are of interest to our community.
This site provides information to assist you in learning more about the legislation and making access requests to LHSC’s Freedom of Information (FOI) Office.
Please note: Access to personal health information, such as in a patient’s medical chart, is not available under FIPPA. The Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) applies to a patient’s medical information and the hospital protects medical information in accordance with PHIPA. You are able to access or correct your own personal health information by contacting the Health Records department.
