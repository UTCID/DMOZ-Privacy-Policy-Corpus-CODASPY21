Hand Upper Extremity Problems
Center for Brachial Plexus Injuries
Allegheny Health Network (AHN) is one of a few programs in western Pennsylvania capable of treating nerve damage from brachial plexus injuries. These life-changing injuries can make it difficult to use your arms or hands. But healing is possible. We perform innovative hand surgery procedures that restore more normal functioning so you can move forward with your life.
What are brachial plexus injuries?
The brachial plexus is a network of nerves running from your neck to your armpit, controlling the feeling and movement in your arms and hands. Each nerve is as fine as a strand of hair.
Brachial plexus nerve injuries can occur when:
The arm is pulled or stretched with great force, such as during a motorcycle accident
Nerves are cut, which may result from knife or gunshot wounds
Brachial plexus injury care at AHN: Why choose us?
AHN’s Center for Brachial Plexus Injuries is home to some of the country’s leading hand surgeons. We performed the region’s first nerve transfer procedure to repair severe nerve damage. A patient with no sensation in her arm was able to return to her favorite pastime of painting after undergoing this procedure.
Highlights of our program include:
Highly skilled team: You receive care from doctors who completed additional training (fellowships) in hand surgery. Our expertise translates to exceptional care for any upper extremity problem – from your shoulders to your fingertips. Read more about our Hand and Upper Extremity Division.
Expertise in complex injuries (trauma): AHN was the first Level I Trauma Center serving western Pennsylvania. We offer the highest level of care for broken bones and injuries due to car accidents. Find out more about orthopaedic trauma.
Research: We are advancing care for brachial plexus injuries. These efforts include pioneering procedures to repair nerve damage, helping you regain sensation and functioning. Find out more about our Orthopaedic Research Institute.
Hand surgery for brachial plexus injuries
Nerve damage in the brachial plexus affects the communication between the nerves and the brain. Our hand surgeons perform sophisticated procedures to re-establish the brain-nerve connection.
Your care may include:
Reattaching edges of a nerve that has been cut
Replacing the damaged nerve with a healthy nerve from another part of the body, called a nerve transfer procedure
Hand surgery is often the first step in your care journey. Additional treatments, such as physical therapy, help you prevent joint stiffness and build strength as you recover. Our team includes certified hand therapists who deliver focused care to help you achieve exceptional results. Find out more about orthopaedic physical therapy.
