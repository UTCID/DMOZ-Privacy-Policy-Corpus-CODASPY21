Diseases and Conditions
Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a general term for a variety of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is a chronic disease that can lead to serious events, including heart attack, stroke and death. Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada and the leading cause worldwide.
At the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, we specialize in the diagnosis, care, and treatment of all adult forms of heart disease.
