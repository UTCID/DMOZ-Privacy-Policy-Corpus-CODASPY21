Contract Support
We work with investigators to negotiate and finalize research contracts with their research collaborators from industry, academia and government. Contract support is provided for all types of agreements required to conduct research, from non-disclosure agreements to data and material transfer agreements to research and collaboration agreements.
Protection of Research Discoveries
We work with investigators to document new research discoveries, evaluate the patentability and commercial potential, and obtain the appropriate intellectual property protection, when applicable.
