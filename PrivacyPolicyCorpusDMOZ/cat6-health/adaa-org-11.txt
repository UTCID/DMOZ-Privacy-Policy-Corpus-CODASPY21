Coping with neurological illnesses can be very distressing. Can cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) be helpful for the anxiety and depression that often accompanies these illnesses? Dr. Suma Chand, an expert in this area, provides us with answers. If you or a loved one has a neurological disorder – such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy or myasthenia gravis – we encourage you to listen and share the webinar.
