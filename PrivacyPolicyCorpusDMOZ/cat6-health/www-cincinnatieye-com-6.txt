Chalazion
A chalazion is a small, non-infectious lump that develops in the upper or lower eyelid due to the blockage of the meibomian gland, an oil gland in the eyelid. The meibomian gland produces fluid that lubricates the eye. While children do develop chalazions, they more commonly affect adults between the ages of 30 to 50.
Causes of Chalazion
There are almost 100 meibomian glands in the eyelid, located near the eyelashes. When the duct that drains the gland is blocked, the fluid becomes backed up inside the gland and forms a chalazion. A chalazion may also form as a result of an eyelid infection.
Symptoms of Chalazion
A bump or lump in the upper or lower eyelid
Tenderness of the eyelid
Sensitivity to light
Excessive tearing
Blurry vision
Blepharitis
Astigmatism
Treatment of Chalazion
Chalazion usually resolve on their own, over the course of time. It can take a few months before they disappear. To treat a chalazion, the following options are available:
Warm compresses applied four times a day for 10 to 15 minutes each time
Antibiotic ointment
Steroid injection
Surgical drainage
While older children and adults may undergo the surgical drainage procedure in a doctor’s office under local anesthesia, general anesthesia is usually recommended for a chalazion removal in young children. If a chalazion recurs in the same place, a tissue biopsy may be conducted in order to rule out a more serious issue.
