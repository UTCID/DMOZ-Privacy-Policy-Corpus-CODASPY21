Helping You Sleep Well
Getting a good night's sleep is vital to every aspect of life, yet according to
the National Sleep Foundation, between 50 and 70 million Americans experience some
sort of sleep or wakefulness disorder. With the right help, everyone should be able
to enjoy restful nights and wide-awake days.
If you feel that you have a sleep disorder, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Sleep
Medicine Centers’ specialists have the expertise to treat your problem. Our
centers are equipped with the latest sleep-testing equipment to diagnose and treat
the full range of disorders, including snoring, sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg
syndrome, sleepwalking and narcolepsy.
We have a full team of experts from different specialties who work together to
treat your sleep disorder. You may see doctors specializing in ear, nose and throat
(ENT), internal medicine, neurology and pulmonology.
PAMF’s sleep centers are conveniently located in the East Bay, on the Peninsula
and in the Santa Cruz area. The PAMF sleep centers in Capitola and Sunnyvale are fully
accredited by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the national leader in setting
standards and promoting excellence in sleep medicine.
