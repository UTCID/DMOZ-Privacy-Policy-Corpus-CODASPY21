Privacy Policy, Grievance, and Consent to Treatment
HIPAA was passed to help protect and safeguard the security and confidentiality of your health information. One part of HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, aims to keep your medical information private and prevent unnecessary disclosures of your protected health information (PHI).
Our privacy policy is posted in each of our waiting rooms and you will be asked to sign a form saying that you are familiar with its contents.
The HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, which implements changes made by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), further enhances your privacy protections, by providing new rights to your health information, and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce the law.
