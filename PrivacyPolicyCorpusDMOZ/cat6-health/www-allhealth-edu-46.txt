Endocrinology & Autoimmune Thyroid Disease
If your thyroid gland produces more or less hormone than it should, you may not feel like yourself. Feeling overtired and anxious are just two symptoms sometimes caused by autoimmune thyroid disorders. We can help.
At the Autoimmunity Institute, our team includes physicians who specialize in complex autoimmune thyroid conditions, such as Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease. Get the medical expertise you need — from more than one specialist, if needed.
Specialized care for autoimmune thyroid disorders
When the body’s immune system attacks the thyroid gland (located in your neck), it can lead to an autoimmune disorder, such as:
Graves’ disease (overactive thyroid)
Hashimoto’s disease (underactive thyroid or autoimmune thyroiditis)
We use comprehensive blood tests and our physicians’ expertise to pinpoint the right diagnosis — the first step to relieving your symptoms. Medication can effectively treat many forms of autoimmune thyroid disease. Sometimes, no treatment is best.
Our specialists will sit down with you to explain the specifics of the condition as well as all your treatment options. If necessary, we will partner with you over the long term to track any changes in your thyroid function to improve your overall health.
