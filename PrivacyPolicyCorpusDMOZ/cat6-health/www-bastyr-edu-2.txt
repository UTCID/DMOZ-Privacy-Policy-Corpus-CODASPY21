Privacy Policy
Bastyr University respects the privacy of the people who visit and submit information to our Web site and we adhere to the following privacy policy. If you have any questions about this policy, please e-mail webmaster@bastyr.edu.
What We Do With the Data We Collect
We use the contact information you voluntarily provide to respond to your questions and requests and, if you specify, to include you on a mailing list so that we can notify you of relevant news. We do not share this information with anyone outside of Bastyr University.
We use your Internet address (IP address) to monitor usage of the site, but we do not attach any personal data to that IP address. Additionally, we may also monitor the domain name from which you access the Internet and the Web browser you use. We are interested in tracking the general behavior of visitors to our site, not the behavior profile of specific users. However, we do monitor some aspects of specific user behavior for those who join our e-mailing list (See E-mail Communication below). We track the general behavior of users on the site in order to determine what information is requested and how we can make it easier to find in the future. We may also use this information to provide you with more relevant academic program information, admissions and alumni announcements or other university news.
We use "cookies" to ensure that you obtain the information you request. The cookies that we pass you are anonymous. They do not reveal your personal identity. They are not revealed to other Web sites, nor can they capture private data. Rather, these cookies establish a user session and allow our server to efficiently exchange data with you. Any data captured are for internal use only and are not shared with a third party.
Security
We use SSL (secure socket layers) to safeguard your personal data against interception during transmission. When conducting e-commerce transactions, Bastyr University does not store customers' credit card account information.
E-Mail Communication
If you choose to be included on our e-mailing list, we may monitor and make use of your user activity, such as the Web site address or specific link from which you accessed our Web site. We track correspondence in order to provide you with more relevant academic program information, admissions and alumni announcements or other university news. You may choose to opt out of e-mail communication from us at any time. Please e-mail webmaster@bastyr.edu or call us at (425) 602-3000. At the time of sending any e-mail communication to you, we will also give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our e-mailing list.
