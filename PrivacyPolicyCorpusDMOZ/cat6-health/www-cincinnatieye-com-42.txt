The Fluorescein Angiography Procedure
The patient’s pupils are dilated with eye drops
A baseline photograph of the inside of the eye is taken with a special ophthalmic camera
A contrast dye is injected into the patient’s arm
As the contrast dye circulates in the eyes, more photographs will be taken
After about 20 minutes, a final set of photographs is taken for comparison. The doctor will be able to determine if the blood vessels are closed, leaking fluid or blocked.
