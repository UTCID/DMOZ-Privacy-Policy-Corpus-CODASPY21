Frequently Asked Questions
What animals are considered service animals?Any animal trained to perform tasks for an individual with a disability is considered a service animal. Under current law, only dogs -- and in limited circumstances -- miniature horses are considered service animals.
What does a service dog do? Service dogs guide people who are blind, alert people who are deaf, assist individuals with mobility issues by carrying bags, or pulling wheelchairs, or remind people with mental illness to take prescribed medications. Some animals are trained to calm individuals with PTSD or traumatic brain injury or autistic individuals.
Where in the hospital are service dogs allowed to go? Service dogs are allowed to accompany individuals with disabilities to admission and discharge offices, inpatient and outpatient rooms, clinics, and the cafeteria. Service dogs may NOT accompany their handlers to restricted areas such as the CCU, Operating Room, Recovery Room, Labor or Birthing Rooms, or Contact Precaution Rooms.
Are service dogs required to wear identifying clothing? No. Service animals are not required to wear any special vests or badges. If individuals misrepresent their dogs as service animals, this is punishable by law.
Is a service dog required to be leashed? Yes, unless being restrained interferes with the task they are trained to perform.
Is an emotional-support or comfort dog allowed at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital? The answer to this is NO. Only service dogs and Wentworth-Douglass Therapy Program dogs are allowed in the hospital. Emotional support animals, comfort animals, and therapy dogs are not service animals under Title II and Title III of the ADA.
