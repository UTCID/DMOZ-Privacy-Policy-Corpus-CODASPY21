Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition that causes brittle bones, which increases the risk of fractures.
That’s why people with osteoporosis know that any fall can be dangerous.
At Allegheny Health Network (AHN), our orthopaedic experts go beyond offering expert fracture care: We use research-based practices to improve your bone health and avoid fractures, doing everything possible to help you live a full, active life.
What is osteoporosis?
Your bones are actively at work replacing worn-out tissue with new tissue. When you have osteoporosis, bone tissue wears away faster than it gets replaced. Bones become brittle, leaving you at risk for fracture, especially in your wrists, hips, and spine.
Fractures in these areas are particularly painful and can threaten your independence. Preventive care and a healthy lifestyle may lower your risk. Read more about bone health.
Osteoporosis care at AHN: Why choose us?
We were the first program in Western Pennsylvania to participate in the American Orthopaedic Association’s Own the Bone® program. This program uses proven bone care practices along with personalized support to help you live a full and active life. Learn more about this program at Jefferson Hospital.
If a fracture happens, you can breathe easier knowing our entire team is here for you. AHN is home to nationally recognized orthopaedic experts who specialize in wrist and spine problems. We offer a wide range of treatments, including hormone therapy and surgery for severe fractures. Our team also includes certified physical therapists who help you make a safe transition back to daily activities. Meet our orthopaedic and sports medicine team.
Introducing the AHN Osteoporosis and Fragility Fracture Clinic
50% of women over the age of 50 will break a bone because of osteoporosis. That’s why we’ve brought Western Pennsylvania’s first dedicated osteoporosis clinic to Jefferson Hospital. The AHN Osteoporosis and Fragility Fracture Clinic provides:
Free Bone Density Screenings
Free quarterly support groups featuring a panel of osteoporosis experts
1 on 1 counseling with physical therapists, doctors, dieticians, and certified fracture liaisons
Coordination with your primary care provider to make sure treatments work with your overall health goals
Preventive care for osteoporosis
We consider your medical needs and preferences while developing a personalized plan to prevent fractures.
Your plan may include:
Nutrition counseling: We help you find foods you like to eat that also contain bone-boosting vitamin D and calcium.
Physical activity: Getting active by walking or gardening a few times per week may help strengthen your bones. These activities also improve coordination, which lowers your risk for falls.
Lifestyle changes: Tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol interfere with your natural ability to grow strong bones. Quitting tobacco and limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake may help you stay on track for good bone health.
Medication: We may recommend certain prescription medications to slow or stop bone loss.
Preventing falls: Taking steps to avoid falls lowers your fracture risk. Consider wearing shoes with non-slip soles and keeping household items, such as the TV remote control, within easy reach.
Regular testing: Bone density testing helps us monitor your bone health and determine if you need additional treatments. We offer several testing options, including advanced bone X-ray tests (DXA) and tests that measure bones with sound waves (ultrasound).
