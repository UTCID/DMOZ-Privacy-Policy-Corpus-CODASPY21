How Can We Help
There is a lot of help out there if you know how to go about finding it!  We offer a lot of information on the website, but if you are in pain and it's too much to study, we understand.  If you have a diagnosis of Arachnoiditis then why not head over to our Facebook Group?  There are people there from all over the world, all out to support each other through good times and bad.  They won't be able to give diagnostic advice and we would request you don't ask, but they will pick you up, brush you off and have you laughing before you know it!
Do you suffer from chronic back pain?  Then read the causes of Arachnoiditis and should any of these relate to you then you might want to email us for more information, or telephone.  You can also ask questions on our Forum.
Many of the people who have contacted us have been told their pain is psychosomatic, all in their head. Sufferers often feel alienated from family and friends, depressed from both pain and rejection, sadly this is common, but if you are one of these people know that you are not alone.  Even discussing the problem with someone who is willing to listen can help, so why not drop us a line, we will try to help, if we can.
