Passively
We collect information from you automatically when you use our Services. When you navigate the Services, we and our vendors may collect Usage Information through a variety of technical methods, including Cookies and Web Beacons, and other technologies (collectively, “Data Collection Technologies”). For more information about how we use Data Collection Technologies, please see the section titled “Data Collection Technologies” below. To learn how to exercise your choices about Data Collection Technologies, please see the section titled “Your Rights.”
From third parties.
We may collect your information from sources other than you, such as from your friends and family and certain service providers. For example, a friend or family member may contact us on your behalf for information about our Services or refer you to our Services. If you provide CTCA with Personal Information pertaining to someone other than yourself, you must have that person’s consent to share his or her Personal Information with us or otherwise contact us on that person’s behalf.
Through social media.
We may collect your Personal Information and/or Usage Information if you connect to us through social media. The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect will depend on your privacy settings for that social media.
If you choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, you may still be able to access and use some of our Services. Note, however, that certain features of our Services that require your information may not be accessible to you.
How we use your information
We use your Personal Information and Usage Information to operate, provide, analyze, and improve the Services, consistent with our commitments in this Privacy Policy.
We use the information we collect for our business purposes, including:
Providing you the Services and fulfilling your requests. We may use your information to register you, administer your account and profile, enable financial transactions, or provide you the information and services that you request, including information about health care and health-related services and resources.
Communicating with you. We may contact you to share information and marketing materials that we think might be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from us by using the “Unsubscribe” link included in the marketing email. We may also send you administrative messages such as support updates, technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages about changes to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or CTCA.
Enhancing your experience. We use your information to personalize and enhance your experience when you use the Services, such as tailoring content and advertising and remembering your preferences.
Monitoring, improving, and developing Services. Your information helps us improve the content and functionality of our Services. For example, we may use our users’ demographics, interests, and behaviors to create new features and content. We may also use your information to monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with the Services.
Preventing illegal activities. We use your information to detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities. We also may use your information to protect the rights and property of CTCA and others.
As disclosed. In addition to those purposes listed above, we may use your information for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time of collection. Where required, we will obtain your consent prior to using information as disclosed.
We may link Usage Information to Personal Information we have collected about you. If we do so, we will treat such linked information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may de-identify or aggregate your information with those of users of the Services. This de-identified or Aggregate Information may be used by us for any lawful purpose, including for data mining and analytics.
Data collection technologies
We use Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies to provide you with a better experience when you use the Services. Data Collection Technologies help you log on to the Services, remember your settings and preferences, help us keep your information safe and secure, and enable our partners to serve ads for our products or Services, including those targeted to your interests.
For example, we partner with Google Analytics, who uses Cookies to track your interactions with our Services. Google then collects that information and reports it back to us. This information helps us improve our Services so that we can better serve users like you. For more information on Google Analytics, visit https://support.google.com/analytics.
Although most browsers and devices accept Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline Cookies. If you disable Cookies, some of the features of our Services may not function properly.
Interest Based Advertising: We may use vendors to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These advertising vendors may collect (through the use of Data Collection Technologies) information about your visits to and interactions with our Services. In addition, our vendors may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for any products and services available from us. If you would like more information about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/. To learn more about how to opt out of our interest-based advertising, please visit the “Your Rights” section below. CTCA will not serve targeted advertisements related specifically to cancer. For example, if you read an article on our Services about breast cancer, we will not serve you advertisements related to breast cancer. Our targeted advertisements are meant to target your general health- and wellness-related interests, such as health, exercise, and nutritional information. We also may serve general advertisements about CTCA and our treatment programs.
Third Party Advertising: We may use third-party features (e.g., social media sharing tools) or otherwise allow third parties to collect information about your use of the Services.
We do not control how such third parties process information. To learn more about how to opt out of interest-based advertising that may be supported by third-party activities, please visit the “Your Rights” section below.
Use of Dynamic Phone Numbers: We may use dynamic number insertion (“DNI”) technology to assess the effectiveness of our Services and to optimize the content and customer service you receive. DNI technology involves randomly assigning a unique and dynamic phone number to your browser when you visit the Services. If you call that phone number, we and our DNI vendor
will be able to link that phone number to: (1) the phone number you use to call us; and (2) certain Usage Information about your use of the Services. When you call a dynamic phone number, the information that we may link to it will become Protected Health Information and treated in accordance with our Notices of Privacy Practices.
Please note: Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature (“DNT”) that signals to the websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Our Services do not currently respond to web browser DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, please visit http://allaboutdnt.com.
With whom we share your information
We may share your information for the reason(s) disclosed to you at the time we collect it, with your consent as required, at your direction, as well as for our business purposes in the following ways:
With our vendors. We may share your Personal Information with our vendors as necessary to enable them to provide services to us. Vendors are third parties (other companies and individuals) that support the operation and maintenance of our Services and that have agreed to keep the Personal Information we share with them confidential.
With our commonly owned entities. We may share your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership and control of CTCA, as described in the definition of CTCA below. We do this in order to provide you better service, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience.
For legal purposes. We may share your Personal Information as reasonably necessary to comply with law or a legal process (including a court or government order or subpoena) or government reporting obligation, to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, intellectual property infringement, security or technical issues, to enforce this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use or otherwise address misuse of the Services, and to protect the rights, property or safety of CTCA, our members and users, and/or the public.
During a corporate transaction. If CTCA is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale, liquidation, or transfer of business or assets, information collected from and about users may be transferred to one or more third parties involved in such transaction and, upon such transfer, the relevant third party privacy policy or policies may govern further use of the information.
The following categories of your personal information may be shared with these parties
to achieve our business purposes:
Identifiers (e.g., name, contact information including email address, username, password, online and device IDs);
Employment-related information;
Demographic information (e.g. date of birth and gender);
Geographic information;
Health information (e.g., personal or family medical history and insurance information, insurance provider, and type of insurance);
Other information such as billing information and religious affiliation); and
Inferences regarding preferences or other characteristics
We reserve the right to share or sell Aggregate Information and other de-identified information to third parties for their own internal purposes, and publicly disclose such Aggregate Information and de-identified information, for example, in our marketing materials and research reports. We may also share Usage Information with third parties to enable certain functionalities of our Services, such as social media plug-ins (“share” and “like” buttons).
Your rights
Your preferences about how we use your information are important to us and, when possible, we aim to honor them. We offer the following rights that you can exercise with regard to your Personal Information.
Access and modify your Personal Information. You may contact us using the information below to request access to or modification of the Personal Information we maintain about you.
Opt out of marketing and other communications. You can request to manage marketing and certain other communications such as our newsletters and certain other notifications by calling us using the information below or the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails.
Managing Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies. You have a number of options to manage or limit how we and our vendors use Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies including for advertising:
To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
For information about your options for opting out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history from our advertising partners, where possible, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/. You may also opt out of interest-based advertising through the NAI by visiting http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ and following NAI’s on-screen instructions. Note that if you opt out through the NAI, you will still receive advertising, but the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. In addition, if you opt out through NAI and later delete your Cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new device, you will need to opt out of interest-based advertising again.
Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device. For example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.
You may be able to disable cookies or choose the types of cookies you wish to allow. Please refer to your browser settings.
Your California privacy rights
The California Consumer Privacy Act, effective January 1, 2020, provides California residents with additional rights and disclosures. In addition, California’s long-standing “California Shine the Light” law provides that California residents may request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes. The California rights do not apply to Protected Health Information we maintain but you may have other rights in relation to such information.
If you are a California resident and have used our Services, you can request a list of the personal information we have shared with third parties for their marketing purposes, if any. We will also give you a list of the third parties that have received your information. You can make a request one time each year. To make a request, please contact us as described in the How to Contact Us section, below. In your letter, mention that you are a California resident and that you are making a “California Shine the Light” inquiry. We will respond to you within 30 days.
The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California residents with the following privacy rights:The right to know
As a California resident, you have a right to request us to disclose to you, no more than twice in a 12-month period, the personal information about you that we collect, use, disclose, and sell during the preceding 12 months. Such disclosure includes:
The categories of personal information that we've collected and sold about you, or shared for a business purpose with our service providers;
The sources from which we collected such information;
The third parties with whom we've shared that personal information and to whom we've sold that personal information;
The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information; and
The specific pieces of personal information we've collected about you.
The right to delete
As a California resident, you have the right to request the deletion of personal information that we have collected from you. We have the right, however, to deny your deletion request when the information is necessary for us or a service provider to do any of the following:
Complete your transaction;
Provide you a good or service;
Perform a contract between us and you;
Protect your security and prosecute those responsible for breaching it;
Fix our system in the case of a bug;
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interests that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws;
Comply with a legal obligation; or
Make other internal and lawful uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
The right to opt out of sales:
As a California resident, you have a right to direct us to not sell your personal information.
We do not, however, sell your personal information to third parties. We have not sold your personal information in the preceding 12 months. We do, however, reserve the right to share Aggregate Information and other de-identified information to third parties for their own internal purposes as described in the “With whom we share your information” section of this Privacy Policy.
We will not discriminate against you because you exercised your rights under this section of the Privacy Policy.
How we protect your information
The security of Personal Information is important to us. We use reasonable safeguards aimed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the Personal Information we collect and maintain. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Services.
Children's privacy rights
Neither CTCA nor any of its Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that a user is under the age of thirteen and has provided Personal Information to us without prior parental consent, we will remove Personal Information provided by such underage user from our database.
Note to international users
Our Services are intended for individuals located in the United States. If you are outside of the United States and access the Services or submit your Personal Information to us, please be advised that U.S. law may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction. If you visit our Services or contact us from outside of the United States, please be advised that (1) any information you provide to us or that we automatically collect will be received in the United States and may be transferred to other jurisdictions; and (2) that by using our Services or submitting information, you explicitly authorize its processing in the United States and subsequent transfers outside the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that you will not access the services from the European Union or the European Economic Area.
Third party links and services
We provide links to third party websites operated by organizations not affiliated with CTCA. CTCA does not review or endorse, and is not responsible for, the privacy practices of these organizations. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by CTCA through the Services.
Changes to this privacy policy
As we improve our Services over time, we may need to update this Privacy Policy to reflect new ways we may collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information. When we update this Privacy Policy, we will post a new Effective Date. If we make material changes that would impact your use of the Services or your privacy, we will endeavor to notify you of the changes prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice directly on the Services, by sending an email notification (if you have provided your email address to us), or by any other reasonable method.
