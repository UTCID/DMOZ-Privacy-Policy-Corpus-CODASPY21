User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ACS, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and assigns from and against all losses, expenses, damages, costs (including, but not limited to, direct, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive, and direct damages), reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from or arising out of the User's use, misuse, or inability to use the Website or any violation by the User of this Agreement.
11. Termination of Agreement
Either ACS or User may terminate this Agreement at its discretion. In addition to ACS' other rights, ACS may terminate access to this Website or cancel membership to any service that ACS provides on the Website if User breaches this Agreement in any way or engages in conduct that ACS deems inappropriate. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the provisions found in Sections 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall survive.
12. Governing Laws
The Website is based in the United States. Access to the website may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.
This Agreement will be governed by the internal laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its choice of law provisions. You agree that any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought only in a court of competent jurisdiction in Illinois, and you hereby consent to the jurisdiction, venue and convenience of such courts.
13. Miscellaneous

Upon User's breach of this Agreement, ACS may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief. ACS' remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of ACS to exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of this Agreement at any time shall not operate as a waiver of any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Agreement at any time thereafter.
