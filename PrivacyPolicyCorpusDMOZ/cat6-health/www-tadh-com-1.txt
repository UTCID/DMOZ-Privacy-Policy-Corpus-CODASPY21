You are hereHome » Patients & Visitors » Privacy
On November 1, 2004, the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) became law. PHIPA is Ontario's health-specific privacy legislation. It governs the manner in which personal health information may be collected, used and disclosed within the health care system. It also confirms a patient's right to access one's own personal health information.
TADH Commitment
At TADH, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our patients and the confidentiality and security of all personal health information to which we are entrusted with by our patients. Your personal health information will only be used in compliance with TADH’s privacy program.
