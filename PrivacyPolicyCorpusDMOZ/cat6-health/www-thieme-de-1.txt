Use of Google Analytics
Based on our legitimate interest in analyzing, optimizing and in the commercial operation of our online business according to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, we are using Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google LLC (“Google“). Google is using cookies. The information, created by cookies, about the use of our online offers by our users are normally sent to a Google server in the U.S. and saved there. Google has been certified under the Privacy Shield Frameworks and thus guarantees to adhere to the European data privacy laws (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active). Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offers, to compile reports about the activities within our online offers and to provide further services to us that are connected with the use of our online offers and internet usage. For this, pseudonymous user profiles of the users can be created from the processed data. We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the users‘ IP addresses will be shortened by Google in the European Union member states or in other countries that are members of the “Agreement creating the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement)”. In exceptional cases only, the full IP address will be sent to a server in the U.S. and shortened there. The IP addresses transmitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the storage of the cookies through a respective setting in their browser software. In addition, users can block the collection and processing of those data by Google which were created by the cookie and which refer to the use of our online offers by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. Further information on data usage by Google, potential settings and options how to object can be found on the Google websites: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners (“How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services“), http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads (“Data usage for advertising“), http://www.google.de/settings/ads (“Manage information Google is using to display ads for you“).

Further information on terms of service and data privacy can be found at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/. We would like to point out that Google Analytics was enhanced with the “anonymizeIp“ code on this website in order to guarantee the anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
Use of Webtrends
Some of our websites are using Webtrends Analytics, a web analytics service of the Webtrends Inc., 555 SW Oak Street, Suite 300, Portland Oregon 97206, USA ("Webtrends") as an alternative to Google Analytics. Webtrends is using so-called "cookies", text files which are saved on your computer and which make it possible to analyze the use of the website by you. The information about your usage of this website generated by the cookie is normally transferred to a Webtrends server in the U.S. and saved there. Through the server-side IP anonymization on this website, your IP address is shortened by Webtrends (“IP masking“) and not stored in full. On behalf of the operator of this website, Webtrends will continue to use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to create reports about the activities on the website and to render services to the website operator which are connected to website and internet usage. You can block the storage of cookies by a respective setting in your browser software. However, we would like to point out that, in this case, you will not be able to use all functionalities of this website.

Further information on terms of service and data privacy can be found at https://www.webtrends.com/terms-policies/privacy-statement/.
Use of Mouseflow
Some of our websites use Mouseflow, a web analysis tool of the Mouseflow ApS, Flaesketorvet 68, 1711 Copenhagen, Denmark, to register randomly selected visits (only with anonymized IP address). This will create a protocol of mouse movements, mouse clicks and keyboard interaction with the intention to describe random individual visits of this website as so-called session replays as well as evaluate them as so-called heat maps and to derive potential improvements for this website from this. Data registered by Mouseflow are not personal and will not be forwarded to third parties. Storage and processing of the collected data is taking place within the EU. If you do not wish any data collection by Mouseflow, you can withdraw from it on all websites using Mouseflow, by clicking the following link: https://mouseflow.de/opt-out/.
Adition
We are using the adserver technology Adition by ADITION technologies AG, Oststraße 55, 40211 Düsseldorf, Germany. Adition uses cookies to control and optimize the display of ads in the context of remarketing. Adition does not store any personal data such as name, email addresses or other personal information by setting cookies.

Use of VG Wort measuring methods
Some of our websites use VG Wort „Skalierbare Zentrale Messverfahren“ (SZM) by INFOnline GmbH (INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, D-53119 Bonn, Germany.) for the determination of statistical values regarding the copy probability of texts. Anonymous measurements are made for this. The access count measurements alternatively use a session cookie or a signature which is created from automatically transmitted information of your browser to recognize computer systems. IP addresses will only be processed in anonymized form. The procedure was developed taking into account data privacy regulations. The only goal of the procedure is to determine the copy probability of individual texts. Individual users will not be identified at any given time. Their identity will always be protected. They will not receive any ads via the system. Many of our sites are using JavaScript requests which are used to send access data to Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort). This makes it possible that our authors participate in the payouts by VG Wort which secure the legal pay for the use of copyrighted material according to (53) UrhG. User usage and metadata will be processed for this, and IP addresses will be shortened while the measurement processes are pseudonymous in this. The shortened IP addresses will be stored for a maximum of 60 days. Usage data in connection with a pseudonymous identifier will be stored for a maximum of six months. In addition to that, users are provided with an opt out to withdraw from data collection for the above mentioned purposes: https://optout.ioam.de/. Further information can be found in the INFOnline data privacy statement https://www.infonline.de/datenschutz/benutzer/.

The trust badge and all services marketed with it are a product of the Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Köln, Germany. When you call up the trust badge, the web server will automatically store a so-called server log file which contains e.g. your IP address, date and time of the call up, data volume sent, and the provider requesting the data (access data) and which documents the call. These access data will not be evaluated and will be overwritten seven days after your website visit at the latest.
