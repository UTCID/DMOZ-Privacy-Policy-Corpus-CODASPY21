"Our two beloved fur-baby pups have been under the care of Animal Hospital at Auburn Hills for their whole lives. We highly recommend them to anyone needing kind & compassionate care for the furry members of their family. The care that we have received has always been professional & prompt. What I love best about AHAAH is that while all exams are very thorough, we never feel pressured into unnecessary procedures or purchasing unnecessary products. They are always empathetic & sensitive to our family's needs. You can tell that they stay up-to-date on veterinary science & practices, & they will always explain things to you in a way that you can understand (without making you feel dumb). The staff there is very loving; you can tell that they genuinely love animals & will do all they can to help you & your pets. I hope AHAAH stays around forever because I could not imagine trusting our pups under anyone else's care!"
