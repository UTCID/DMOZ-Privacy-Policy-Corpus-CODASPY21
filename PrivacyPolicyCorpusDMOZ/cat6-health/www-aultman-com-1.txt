Regular business hours Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. After hours, please leave a message and your call will be returned.What is HIPAA?The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was signed into law Aug. 21, 1996, and went into effect in 2003. The Privacy Rule provides federal protections for personal information held by a covered entity, such as Aultman. HIPAA gives you rights over your health information, including the right to get a copy of your information, make sure it is correct, and know who has seen it.How We Assure Your PrivacyYour privacy is very important to us. Our workforce members are trained in the appropriate use and disclosure of health information and know that it is available for the purpose of providing treatment, receive payment or other health care operations. Aultman has policies in place to address privacy violations or failures of a workforce member to protect your information from accidental or unauthorized access.Sharing Health Information with Family Members and FriendsHIPAA sets rules for health care providers and health plans about who can look at and receive your health information, including those closest to you – your family members and friends. The HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that you have rights over your health information, including the right to get your information, and make sure it’s correct. HIPAA requires most doctors, nurses, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers to protect the privacy of your health information. However, if you don’t object, a health care provider or health plan may share relevant information with family members or friends involved in your health care or payment for your health care in certain circumstances. When Your Health Information Can Be SharedUnder HIPAA, your health care provider may share your information face-to-face, over the phone or in writing. A health care provider or health plan may share relevant information if:
You give your provider or plan permission to share the information.
You are present and do not object to sharing the information.
You are not present, and the provider determines based on professional judgment that it’s in your best interest.
How do I get access to my medical records at Aultman?Aultman’s Medical Records Departments are responsible for keeping complete medical records for each patient. Your original medical record is property of Aultman, but you can access your health information by either requesting copies or accessing information from Aultman’s Patient Portal.During your hospitalization, there are processes in place to allow you to review your medical record. Your bedside nurse or nurse manager of your hospital unit can help facilitate this request.After you are discharged or at the end of your care episode, you may request copies of your finalized patient record. The Medical Records Departments are open to the public Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at both Aultman Hospital and Aultman Orrville Hospital.In order to receive copies of your medical record, or to send copies of your medical record to others, you will first need to complete the appropriate release of health information form:
Access Request Form by Patient/Personal Representative (PDF).  This form is used by the Patient/Personal Representative when requesting access to their medical record and released to whomever the patient/personal representative requests.
Authorization for Release of Health Information Form (PDF). This form is used when a third party is requesting the patients’ health information.
Important Steps:
Complete all fields on the form(s) when requesting the release of your records.
If mailing or faxing in the form, make sure you include a copy of your driver's license in order for us to verify your identity.
Make sure the form(s) are signed and dated.
Aultman charges a reasonable cost-based fee for the copying of medical records.  The fee schedule is based on the type of request:Access by patient or personal representative:
Free for information released in paper format.
$6.50 for health information that is maintained electronically and released in an electronic format. Includes labor, supplies, and postage.
Authorization requests by Third Parties:
First ten (10) pages are free.
