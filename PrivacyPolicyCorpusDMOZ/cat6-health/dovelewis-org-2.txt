Donor Privacy Policy
Donor Privacy Policy
Last Amended Date: 2/14/17
DoveLewis believes in safeguarding personal information and ensuring that privacy is respected and protected for donors, volunteers, vendors and clients. We will use personal information to keep donors, clients, vendors and volunteers informed of our activities including our programs, special events and funding needs. We respect all requests to remain anonymous. We will always provide an “opt-out” procedure for donors and others who receive such materials to request that their names be omitted from similar mailings, phone calls, or electronic communications in the future. DoveLewis will not sell, trade, rent or exchange its donor list and donor's personal information with any other organization.
