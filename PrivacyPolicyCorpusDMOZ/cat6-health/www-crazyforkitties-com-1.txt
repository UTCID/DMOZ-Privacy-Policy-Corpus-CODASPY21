Privacy statement for crazyforKITTIES (sm)
Guestbook and Cat Tails: In both these departments, we ask for
your name.
You are free to use as much or as little of your name as
you like -- first name only, last name only, initials.
We do not
use your name for any other purpose besides identifying who made
the Guestbook or Tail entry.
Postcards: The postcard script asks for your name and email
address as well as the name and email address of your recipient.
These are used strictly for email and identifying you to the recipient,
and for no other purpose.
Star of the Week: You may include as much of your name as
you wish along with your cat's biography, or you may remain anonymous.
Newsletter: You'll need to give your email address and first name.
This information will only be used for the newsletter.
