What Information Do We Collect?
We may request that an entity applying for an account with MARKS PSYCHIATRY provide us with certain personal information (such as its name, email address, etc.) relevant to our provision of the various products or services offered on our site. We do not collect any personal information other than that which is specifically and knowingly provided to us.

We also give you an opportunity to opt out of future communications from us.
Cookies
Like most sites, for account management purposes, MARKS PSYCHIATRY uses cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site without using cookies.
Links to Other Sites
The MARKS PSYCHIATRY website contains links to other sites. Those sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. We are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites since we do not control them.
With Whom Do We Share Information?
MARKS PSYCHIATRY may share non-personal and non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

MARKS PSYCHIATRY may partner with other parties in connection with the various services offered on our site, such as credit card processors or email delivery services. In such instances, we may share limited personal information that is necessary for the third-party to provide its services. These companies are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose.
MARKS PSYCHIATRY may also provide personal information when disclosure may be required by law (e.g., subpoenas, search warrants and court orders). We may also determine that such action is reasonably necessary to protect a party’s rights, property, or well- being. This action may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud detection or protection, or in other situations involving suspicious or illegal activities.
