Whether you are a past recipient, donor, or have another kind of donor milk story, you might be able to help champion nonprofit milk banking.
Many of our member milk banks are seeking volunteers at different times of the year for various reasons. We encourage you to reach out to your nearest milk bank to inquire about ways to work together to advance milk banking.
