You agree that you must evaluate and make your own judgment, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content. Under no circumstances will AAST be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any Content that contains any errors, omissions, defamatory statements, or confidential or private information, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content submitted, accessed, transmitted, or otherwise conveyed via the Site and Services. By using the Site and Services, you waive the right to bring or assert any claim against AAST relating to Content, and release AAST from any and all liability for or relating to any Content. AAST has no obligation to review, monitor, or remove any Content or other materials.  However, AAST reserves the right to review, modify, and/or delete any Content that, in its sole judgment, violates these Terms of Use.
You may report Content that you believe violates these Terms of Use or is otherwise unlawful by sending an email to aast@aast.org (for copyright complaints, please see below).  Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) for unlawful misrepresentations. If you are uncertain whether an activity is unlawful, we recommend seeking advice of an attorney.
AAST may display advertisements and other information adjacent to or included with Content submitted by you. You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. The manner, mode, and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.
9. TERMINATION OF ACCESS
AAST may terminate your privilege to use or access the Site and Services immediately and without notice for any reason whatsoever.  Upon such termination, you must immediately cease accessing or using the Site and Services and agree not access or make use of, or attempt to use, the Site and Services. Furthermore, you acknowledge that AAST reserves the right to take action to block, nullify, or deny your ability to access the Site and Services.  You understand that AAST may exercise this right in its sole discretion, and this right shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other rights and remedies available to AAST.
All provisions of these Terms of Use that by their nature should survive termination shall survive the termination of your access to the Site and Services, including, without limitation, provisions regarding ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
10. TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS
AAST, and other Site and Services graphics, logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are the trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of AAST in the U.S. and/or other countries.  These trademarks, service marks, and trade dress may not be used, including as part of trademarks, service marks, and/or domain names, keyword advertisements, or email addresses, or in connection with any product or service in any manner that is likely to cause confusion.
You should assume all Content and material made available on the Site and Services is protected by copyright law. Aside from user-submitted Content, all other materials and other information on the Site and Services, including, but not limited to, all text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio and video clips, downloads, data compilations, and software are the exclusive property of AAST and/or its licensors and are protected by all United States and international copyright laws.
12. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING COPYRIGHT CLAIMS
AAST respects the intellectual property of others. It is our policy to respond expeditiously to legitimate claims of copyright and other intellectual property infringement.  We will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws.  Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying with the DMCA, we may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that is claimed to be infringing.  We may terminate access for users of the Site and Service who are infringers.
Notifying AAST of Copyright Infringement: To provide us with notice of an infringement, you must provide a written communication to the attention of “DMCA Notification Dept.” at aast@aast.org that sets forth the information specified by the DMCA (http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512). Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyright.  We will need the following information from you:
an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
a detailed description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located or found on the Site and Services;
your address, telephone number, and email address;
a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.
Providing AAST with Counter-Notification: If we remove or disable access to Content in response to an infringement notice, we may make reasonable attempts to contact the owner or administrator of the affected content.  If your material has been removed and you feel that your material does not constitute infringement, you may provide us with a counter notification by written communication to the attention of “DMCA Counter Notification Dept.” at aast@aast.org  that sets forth all of the necessary information required by the DMCA (http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512). Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is not infringing the copyrights of others.  If you are uncertain whether an activity constitutes infringement, we recommended seeking advice of an attorney.  We will need the following information from you:
an electronic or physical signature;
identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled;
a statement by you, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which that address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which a service provider may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notice.
12. DELAYS AND ACCESSIBILITY
The Site and Services may be subject to limitations, delays, failure, and other problems inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications. AAST is not responsible for any delays, failures, or other damage resulting from such problems.

YOU AGREE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY REMOVE THE SITE AND SERVICES FOR INDEFINITE PERIODS OF TIME, OR CANCEL THE SITES AND SERVICES AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, AAST’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
AAST USES REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROTECT INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, BUT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND AAST HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR LIABILITY RELATING TO SUCH INFORMATION IN ANY WAY.
14. INDEMNITY

TO THE EXTENT AAST, ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND/OR AGENTS ARE FOUND LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE USE OF THE SITES AND SERVICES, LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED $100 IN THE AGGREGATE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. In some jurisdictions, limitations or exclusions of liability or damages are not permitted. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.
16. NOTICE
By use of the Site and Services, you consent to receive electronic communications from AAST (via email or via a posting on the Site), and you agree that any such communications satisfy any legal requirement to make such communications in writing. You also agree that AAST may communicate any notices to you under these Terms of Use through electronic mail, regular mail, or posting the notices on the Site and Services. All notices to AAST will be provided by either sending: (i) an email to aast@aast.org; or (ii) a letter, first class certified mail, to Sharon Gautschy, AAST Executive Director, 633 N Saint Clair Street, Suite 2600, Chicago, IL 60611. Such notices will be deemed delivered upon the earlier of the verification of delivery or two (2) business days after being sent.
17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
These Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies incorporated by reference to these Terms of Use (including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and AAST. They supersede any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and AAST regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of Use. Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties. You represent and warrant that those third party agreements do not interfere with your obligations and duties to AAST under these Terms of Use.
18. ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
In the event of a dispute between you and AAST arising under or relating to these Terms of Use, the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration shall be administered exclusively by the American Arbitration Association and shall be conducted consistent with the rules, regulations, and requirements thereof.  THIS MEANS NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.   ALSO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  THIS MEANS NEITHER YOU NOR AAST MAY JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
19. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and AAST will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, notwithstanding the choice of law provisions of the venue where any action is brought, where the violation occurred, where you may be located or any other jurisdiction. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Site and Services or these Terms of Use shall be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred.
20. MISCELLANEOUS
If you breach any term of this Terms of Use or other agreement with AAST, AAST may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages and injunctive relief. AAST’s remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of AAST to exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not operate as a waiver of any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Agreement at any time thereafter. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. We may transfer, assign, or delegate the Terms of Use and its rights and obligations without consent. Users of this Site and Services are responsible for compliance with all applicable regulations and laws. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and AAST as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Sites and Services.
