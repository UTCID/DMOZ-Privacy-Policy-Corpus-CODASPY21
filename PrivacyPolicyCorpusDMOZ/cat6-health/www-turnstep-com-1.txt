Turnstep Privacy Policy
Turnstep has been around since before a time when a privacy policy
was ever required, but, alas, those days are gone. Turnstep holds
privacy very important, and does everything it can to protect all
information of people using this site.
All personal information submitted to the site, especially when submitting
a pattern, is completely optional and always has an option to not
be shown publicly. In addition, all email addresses are protected
by using form redirects, so that they will not be gathered for spamming
purposes. (See the
Spambot Beware site for details on
how this is done). Information submitted will never be given out
to other companies or other people, ever, for any reason whatsoever.
This site uses cookies is some areas. These cookies are completely
harmless and optional. Turnstep uses cookies to store your Turnstep
username and password only. This allows you to not have to type out all
the information every time when using areas such as the bulletin board,
the pattern submission form, and other areas.
If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free
