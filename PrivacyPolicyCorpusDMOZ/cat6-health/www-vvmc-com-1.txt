Patient Rights & Privacy Practices
To report a problem contact our Compliance & Privacy Hotline at (888) 495-4151 or report a problem online.
Vail Health makes every effort to provide a foundation for understanding and respecting the rights of patients and their families. We provide care that is sensitive to cultural, racial, religious or other differences. We do not discriminate based on race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability or source of payment. We respond to reasonable requests for treatment and to each person's health care needs. Our response depends on the urgency of each situation and our ability to provide the kind of treatment the patient may require.
We ask that patients participate in decisions about their health care by talking with caregivers and taking an active role in planning their care. This helps ensure the care our patients receive preserves their dignity and reflects their desires and values. A designated surrogate or proxy decision-maker may exercise these rights on the patient’s behalf if the patient lacks decision-making capacity, is legally incompetent or is a minor. Interpreter assistance is available at no cost to patients and/or their family when patients receive services provided by the hospital.

Patient Rights Regarding Self-Administered Drugs Given in Outpatient Settings
Sometimes people with Medicare need “self-administered drugs” while in hospital outpatient settings. “Self-administered drugs” are drugs you would normally take on your own. Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) generally doesn’t pay for self-administered drugs unless they are required for the hospital outpatient services you’re getting. If you get self-administered drugs that aren’t covered by Medicare Part B while in a hospital outpatient setting, the hospital may bill you for the drug. However, if you are enrolled in a Medicare drug plan (Part D), these drugs may be covered.
For more information, read How Medicare Covers Self-Administered Drugs Given in Hospital Outpatient Settings (pdf).
