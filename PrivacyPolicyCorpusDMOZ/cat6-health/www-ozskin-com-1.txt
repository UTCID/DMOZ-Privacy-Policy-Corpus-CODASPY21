Your skin through the ages
preteens & teenagersAcne and other skin problems can start at an early age, and if left untreated may affect self-confidence and lead to low self-esteem, Young acne sufferers should seek treatment as soon as possible to prevent unnecessary scarring, suffering and to reduce the need for medication.
twentiesEven as young as twenty-five, your face begins to show visible signs of aging. Collagen levels start to fall, cell renewal slows and fat decreases from the eye contour. This leads to the development of frown lines, crow’s feet and eye bags – making your twenties all about prevention! Put a strong focus on active skincare and treatments that prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Remember to always wear sunscreen!
thirtiesIn your thirties, more fine lines and wrinkles start to appear as elastin and collagen continue to break down. You might notice the edge of your brow begin to sag, forehead lines appear and the skin around your eyes start to thin. Stretch marks are also common. This is a great time to invest in a tailored skin treatment plan that targets your concerns and helps maintain your youthful skin.
fortiesIt’s the decade when deeper lines begin to etch around the mouth, eyes and forehead. You might also notice circles darken around the eyes. Turn your focus to treatments that generate collagen – think of it as superannuation for your skin! The idea is to put away as much collagen as possible in your forties and early fifties, so when the time comes that your body can no longer produce it, you have plenty in reserve.
fiftiesBetween the age of forty and fifty collagen production slows dramatically and you lose the ability to replenish collagen stores. Menopause or hormone changes increase glycation, rapidly breaking down the natural collagen support and causing the skin to sag. If you’ve noticed thinning lips, fine lines or age spots, speak to our trained technicians about a rejuvenation plan to reduce these classic signs of ageing!
sixties & beyondYou deserve to be sixty and fabulous! Many people in their sixties and beyond say that they feel younger than they look and now have more time to spoil themselves. The most common treatments for this age group include a combination of skin rejuvenation, collagen induction, anti-wrinkle injections and more!
