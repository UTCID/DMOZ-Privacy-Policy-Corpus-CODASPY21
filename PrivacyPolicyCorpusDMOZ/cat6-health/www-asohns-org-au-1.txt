Privacy Policy
Information collected
The Society may collect identifiable information such as contact details. Further, access to member only services has been made possible by using information contained in Society databases. Accordingly, we collect personal information to facilitate the granting of access to member only services.
Access to information collected
The Society will not make an attempt to identify users or their browsing activities. However, in the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect our Internet Service Provider's logs, and thus gain information about users and their activities. All of the identified information that the Society has used to grant member access can be viewed and changed by members when they view their personal details.
Use and disclosure of information collected
Any information you provide will only be used for the purposes for which you have provided it. It will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent.
Cookies
This website will use cookies to manage login and logout.
Security
We endeavour to ensure the Society website is secure through the use of firewalls. Personal data is maintained under strict security and can only be accessed internally by the Society employees who have permission to do so.
Find a Surgeon directory
Information retrieved by the Find a surgeon directory on the Society website will be limited to the practice address, phone, website URL and Member-nominated Areas of Special Interest of Members who are listed.
Changes to privacy statement
The Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery reserves the right to modify or amend this privacy statement at any time, provided that those modifications or amendments comply with the Privacy Act.
