Helping Each Other: Sexual Exploitation project Training Materials
Helping Each Other
Helping Each Other was an ARC three year project, funded by Comic Relief.  The innovative project trained 12 young people with learning disabilities, who have experienced sexual exploitation, to become peer trainers, and supported them to deliver awareness sessions to 200 other young people with learning disabilities. They were also supported to make presentations at conferences and workshops, and to groups of professionals.
As part of the project, materials were developed that can be used independently to raise awareness about sexual exploitation with more young people with learning disabilities. These can be downloaded below:
