Privacy and Health Record Resource Handbook For Medical Practitioners in the Private Sector
The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) affects the way private medical practices handle patients' information. The AMA has created the AMA Privacy and Health Record Resource Handbook For Medical Practitioners in the Private Sector to help practices comply with their legal obligations. It contains a sample privacy policy which can be used by practices, as well as other important information and resources.
19 Jan 2017
The AMA Privacy and Health Record Resource Handbook For Medical Practitioners in the Private Sector is regularly updated to keep abreast of the latest development in privacy law. More recently, the AMA worked with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to ensure that the  sample privacy policy is up to date and covers all necessary areas as required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).Members should refer to this sample privacy policy when revising their own privacy policy. The AMA recommends that medical practices regularly review their privacy policies.  Related document (Public):  AMA Privacy Handbook Update dated 21 July 2017.pdf AMA Sample Privacy Policy Final.docx
