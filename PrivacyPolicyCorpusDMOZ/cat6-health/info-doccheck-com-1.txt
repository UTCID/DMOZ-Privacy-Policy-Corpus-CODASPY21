We only collect information that is necessary to fulfill the contract between you and DocCheck or is relevant for an optimal user experience.
3.1 Data that you provide3.1.1 Basic personal dataWhen registering, we will collect the personal information we need to set up your DocCheck account and provide our services. These are first name, surname, profession, area of expertise, area of activity, additional names, postal code, street, residence, e-mail address and a self-chosen password. This data is assigned to an individual user ID, which is provided by DocCheck. Your password will be saved via a one-way hash function. This means it can not be recovered or read by anyone, including DocCheck. This data processing is based on art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter b) GDPR.You can also use DocCheck without signing up in read-only mode, but you will not have a user profile, can not post or upload files to DocCheck, and will not receive personalized information.
3.1.2 Proof of medical qualificationIn addition, we ask you to upload a proof of your medical qualification. If you provide a proof of your affiliation to a medical profession to DocCheck, it will be stored with link to your user profile. Without your basic personal data and professional credentials, DocCheck can not review your affiliation with the medical community and can not grant access to information and services that are restricted under the EU-Directive 2001/83/EC or due to ethical reasons. You can use DocCheck without professional credentials, but you will have limited access to some services. The above-mentioned data processing is necessary to extend the functionality of your  DocCheck account and is based on art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter b) GDPR.

3.1.4 Extended personal dataAs part of your usage of DocCheck, we kindly ask you from time to time to provide further information after you finished your registration, e.g. which professional interests you have, if and how you would like to be contacted by eMail or if you would like to participate in market research studies. This extended personal data will be added to your user profile "non-publicly". You may delete, amend, publish or update this data at any time, depending on how much information you want to share with DocCheck and other DocCheck users.

4 Storage of your data Your personal data is stored on DocCheck servers and is protected from unauthorized access by access controls and firewalls. The processing of user data is mainly carried out in-house. If third parties are involved in data storage or processing, they have a data processing contract that guarantees the processing of your data at the same level, that is used by DocCheck. The proof of your medical qualification and employer approvals are stored partly electronically and partly as physical documents (depending on how it has been provided). When uploading files, some file formats (e.g. videos, PDF documents, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) are stored in cloud services. No personal data is transmitted along with the file. Pseudonymised/anonymised data collected by web beacons (e.g. Google Analytics) is stored on the systems of their respective providers.
5 Visibility of your data You can basically control the visibility of your data yourself. However, as DocCheck is a social media platform, some of your data or activities will appear publicly, e.g. your name and your profession. For other personal data you can define different levels of visibility. The visibility levels are "private" (= only visible to you), "contacts" (= only visible to DocCheck users you follow and follow you), "DocCheck users" (= visible to all DocCheck users) and "all" (= public, i.e. also visible to users without DocCheck login). The visibility levels for your assets are "Draft" or "Private" (= only visible to you), "Medical Professionals" (= only visible to DocCheck users with a medical background), "DocCheck Users" (= visible to all DocCheck Users, i.e. also without a professional medical background) and "all" (= public, i.e. also visible to users without DocCheck login). Some of your personal information is also visible outside DocCheck by default. These are your name and surname, your job, your area of expertise and your position. Other data is only visible, if you have shared it with a specific group of users. You can partially disable the visibility of your data and its search engine findability. However, the texts and files you publish are publicly available and searchable if you do not set their visibility to "private" - e.g. Pictures, videos or blog posts.If you don't understand the different visibility levels or if you are feeling uncomfortable to publish your profile as a medical professional on the web, you should not use DocCheck.
6 Use of your data6.1 DocCheck servicesWe use the data listed under 3.1 and 3.2 when you are registering for and using the various DocCheck services. The processing takes place in order to provide these services and is based on art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter b) GDPR and your consent art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter a) GDPR.

The relevant data processing serves our legitimate interest to increase data security and is based on art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR.
6.11 AvailabilityWe collect the information referred to in point 3.2.2 to improve the availability of our services. They ensure a smooth server connection, a stable delivery of our HTML-code and the right formatting of content on different devices.

6.12 Conflict resolutionWe use your information to resolve possible legal conflicts between you and DocCheck, for example, if there is uncertainty whether or not you have consented to receive emails.

7 Disclosure of data7.1 Conditions of DisclosureYour personal information will not be shared with third parties unless you have given the explicit consent to this transfer (art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 a) GDPR)DocCheck is required to do so due to an official requirement or by statutory regulations (art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 c) GDPR)it is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to believe that you have a legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of your data (art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 f) GDPR)it is necessary for the fulfillment of contractual relationships with you (art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter b) GDPR)there is a legitimate business interest of DocCheck, e.g. because we use data processors, especially when DocCheck has to rely on web services of third parties.7.2 Single sign-on The login on websites and apps of companies that use DocCheck as an access system is processed on DocCheck servers. Depending on the procedure (s.b.) this can involve a transfer of personal data. The extent of the data transfer depends on the method used: "Standard": This method does not transfer any data. "Unique Key": This procedure passes a random string that is used to identify repeated visits. The string does not allow any identification of the user. No personal data will be passed on to the entity using the login. "Routing": In this procedure, the occupation, the country, the language or the field of expertise of the user are transferred anonymously to the respective site operator. The purpose of this procedure is to provide different relevant services or contents to different users. The information is transferred without reference to a specific user. This procedure can be combined with "Unique Key". The anonymity of the user is not influenced by this combination."Personal": In this process, a company would like to receive personal data from you as part of the login. The individual data fields that are to be transferred are displayed and the purpose of the data processing is explained. Further details can be found in the privacy policy of the respective company. Your data will only be passed on if you explicitly confirm your consent by clicking or pressing a button. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future by writing an email to info@doccheck.com.

7.3 Order processingDocCheck uses data processors for the delivery of e-mails and for the collection of market research results.Emails are handled by Copernica B.V. for DocCheck. Copernica receives email address, title, salutation and other user parameters from DocCheck, so that the e-mails can be sent with a personal touch. The terms of the data processing are fixed in a contract for order processing with Copernica. The transfer of user data to third parties by Copernica is prohibited.To collect market research data, DocCheck uses the software "EFS Survey" from Questback. Questback will not receive any data from Doccheck, besides an anonymised user ID. In individual cases, data such as occupation, gender, place of residence, practice size or other parameters will be processed. This information stays anonymous - it is not linked to the name of an individual user within EFS Survey. The terms of the data processing are fixed in a order processing contract with Questback. Questback has a contractual obligation not to disclose any market research data to third parties. Should a collection of personal data be necessary in EFS Survey - e.g. participants who are not DocCheck users and have been recruited by post - the users will be notified in a separate privacy policy prior to participation.
7.4 Usage statistics/market research resultsAny statistics and market research results that DocCheck makes available to third parties only use aggegrated and anonymised data. The identification of a single person is not possible. If sharing your personal information might be useful (for example, in the event of drug safety issues), DocCheck will notify you. After that, you can decide on your own if you want to share your data or not.
8 Duration of data storageYour data is stored on DocCheck servers until you delete your DocCheck account. If your account is inactive for more than 24 months - i.e. you have never used your login and have not responded to any e-mails from DocCheck during this time - we will delete your account. Data which we have to store for a longer period due to legal regulations is exempted.
9 Data securityWhen using the DocCheck website we use SSL, so that the transfer of data between you and DocCheck is encrypted if your browser supports this technology. This is usually 256-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we provide the next available standard. You recognize the encryption by a lock or key symbol in your browser. DocCheck takes appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from loss or unauthorized access by third parties resulting in manipulation, theft or destruction. Our security measures comply with the latest standards and are constantly being improved in line with technological developments.
10 Analysis toolsSome of the information mentioned under 3.2 is collected using external third-party analysis tools, which are listed below. The legal basis of the data processing is a legitimate interest in data processing according to art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR. The rationale lies in the continuous optimization of our website and in the need to maintain the functionality of our applications. The respective data categories and processing purposes can be found in the descriptions of the analysis tools:
10.1 Google AnalyticsFor the purpose of customizing and the continuous optimization of our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google").

The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website such asBrowser type/version,Operating system used,Referrer URL (the previously visited page),Host name of the accessing computer (IP address),Time of the server request,are transferred to a Google server in the US and stored there. Google is Privacy Shield certified and has thus committed to complying with the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement published by the US Department of Commerce on the collection, use, and storage of personal data from EU member states. DocCheck has limited the storage period offered by Google to the minimum of 14 months. The information is used to evaluate the usage of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services associated with the usage of the website and the Internet in general for the purposes of market research and tailor-made website design. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of the company. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymized so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking).You may refuse the installation of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, we point out that in this case, not all features of this website may be fully functional.You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (see link).As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent the data collection of Google Analytics by setting an opt-out cookie that prevents future collection of your data when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you must set the opt-out cookie again.For more information about Google Analytics related privacy, please visit the Google Analytics Help Center.The use of Google Analytics and the related data processing includes the use of cookies based on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR as we have a legitimate interest in being able to display targeted advertising to finance our services.
10.2 Skalierbares Zentrales Messverfahren (SZMnG)DocCheck utilizes the measuring method ("SZMnG") of INFOnline GmbH (https://www.INFOnline.de) to determine statistical parameters about the use of our offers. It installs a cookie with the identifier "ioam.de". The aim of the usage measurement is to statistically determine the number of visits to our website, the number of website visitors and their surfing behavior - on the basis of a uniform, standardized procedure - and thus to obtain market-wide comparable values.For all digital offers provided by members of the "Informationgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V." (IVW - http://www.ivw.eu) or the studies of the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V." (AGOF - http://www.agof.de), the usage statistics are regularly processed by AGOF and the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V." (agma - http://www.agma-mmc.de) and published with the performance value "Unique User" and by IVW with the performance values "Page Impression" and "Visits". These ranges and statistics can be viewed on the respective websites.Further information on data protection related to the measurement procedure can be found in our Privacy Declaration and in the data protection declaration on the website of INFOnline GmbH (https://www.INFOnline.de), which governs the measurement procedure, the data protection website of AGOF (http://www.agof.de/datenschutz) and the data protection website of IVW (http://www.ivw.eu).Measurement by INFOnline GmbH using the SZMnG measurement method is carried out with a legitimate interest in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR.The purpose of the processing of personal data is the compilation of statistics and the creation of user categories. The statistics serve to be able to trace and document the use of our offers. The user categories form the basis for an interest-oriented adjustment of advertising media and/or advertising measures. In order to market this website, a usage measurement that ensures comparability with other market participants is essential. Our legitimate interest stems from the economical usability of the findings resulting from the statistics and user categories and the market value of our website - also in direct comparison with third-party websites - which can be determined from these statistics.In addition, we have a legitimate interest in making the pseudonymized data available to INFOnline, AGOF, and IVW for market research purposes (AGOF, agma) and for statistical purposes (INFOnline, IVW). Furthermore, we have a legitimate interest in making the pseudonymized data available to INFOnline for the further development and provision of interest-oriented advertising material.If you do not wish to participate in the measurement, you can object by following this link: https://optout.ioam.de to guarantee an exclusion from the measurement, it is technically necessary to set a cookie. If you delete this cookie in your browser, it is necessary to repeat the opt-out process at the link above.
10.3 Hotjar Analytics
DocCheck uses Hotjar, an analysis software from Hotjar Ltd.
