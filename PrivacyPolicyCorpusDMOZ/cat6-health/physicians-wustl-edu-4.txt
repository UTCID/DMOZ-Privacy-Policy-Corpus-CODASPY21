We respect all our patients and prospective patients’ privacy.

Visitor tracking
We want each Site visitor to find useful medical information and learning about the services of Washington University Physicians. In working toward that goal, we count our visitors and keep track of which pages our visitors select throughout the Site. To do this, we must use software called a “cookie.” The “cookie” maintains numbers in aggregate form, and does not obtain personal information about any of our visitors. This information helps us know what sections of our Site are visited frequently, so we can enhance those sections and ensure the are timely.

We are always interested in your feedback and suggestions. Should you have any questions about the Site, or suggestions for improvement, please contact our site administrator.
