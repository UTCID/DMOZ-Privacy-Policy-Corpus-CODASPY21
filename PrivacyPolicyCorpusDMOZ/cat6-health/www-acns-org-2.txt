ACNS Social Media Policy
ACNS Social Media Policy
Adopted June 2014
ACNS will utilize social media to strengthen its educational mission as well as the Society’s connection to the clinical neurophysiology community. ACNS believes social media can promote the exchange of research among professionals and trainees in the field of clinical neurophysiology and enhance the relationship between ACNS and its journal, The Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology.
Used responsibly, social media has the potential to provide an effective forum for ACNS to keep informed of new trends and topics and to share information and perspectives with professionals in the field. It also presents challenges in ensuring the content is accurate, civil, and appropriate.
Scope of Content
Social media will be used to exchange information and promote education among professionals and the public and foster interactions with scientific, medical, and regulatory communities. Content on ACNS social media sites will be limited to those items and discussions that correspond to areas defined within the ACNS Mission Statement. Specifically, the content will seek to foster excellence in clinical neurophysiology and further the understanding of central and peripheral nervous system function in health and disease through education, research, and the provision of a forum for discussion and interaction.
The scope of content will help ACNS members, ACNS staff, and the public understand the goals of ACNS social media sites.
The scope of content will be the basis for ACNS leadership and staff in deciding information to be added to the social media site.
The scope of content will guide site users as to the appropriate areas for discussion in posts or other interactions with the social media site.
Site Requirements
All ACNS social networking sites shall adhere to applicable state, federal and local laws, regulations and policies including all applicable ACNS and EDI policies as well as HIPAA regulations.
Each ACNS social networking site shall clearly identify the site as an official ACNS publication.
The Scope of Content shall be available to all those utilizing the social media.
All social network sites and entries shall clearly indicate that any articles and any other content posted or submitted for posting are subject to public disclosure.
Where appropriate, social networking sites should link back to the ACNS website (www.acns.org) for additional information.
Each ACNS social networking site will include the ACNS social networking policy, either on the site or through a link to the ACNS website.
All social networking sites shall clearly indicate they are maintained by ACNS and shall have ACNS contact information prominently displayed.
By utilizing the ACNS Social Networking sites, users release ACNS from any liability that may result from use of the Networking site.
Site Administration
ACNS staff and members who review content and posts must have a thorough understanding of the ACNS social media policy.
ACNS staff will monitor the site each working day to ensure material is in compliance with the ACNS Social Media Policy.
ACNS staff will manage addition or removal of content from social media sites.
As needed, ACNS members, specifically members of the Website & Social Media Committee as well as the Executive Committee and Council, will assist staff in determining the appropriateness of content and posts on social media site.
Development of new ACNS social media sites shall require approval by the ACNS Executive Director and President.
Content published by ACNS staff and ACNS members is not to be construed as official ACNS policy unless clearly identified as such and unless officially approved by the ACNS Council.
Site Monitoring
ACNS reserves the right to restrict or remove any content at the discretion of the ACNS Executive Director or President.
ACNS social networking content and comments containing any of the following forms of content shall be removed:
Material that is not within the Scope of Content;
Comments not topically related to the particular site or blog article being commented upon;
Profane language or content;
Content that promotes, fosters, or perpetuates discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, age, religion, gender, marital status or with regard to national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation;
Sexual content or links to sexual content;
Solicitations of commerce that is not approved by ACNS;
Conduct or encouragement of illegal activity.
ACNS Staff will follow the ACNS Social Networking Procedures when monitoring content on ACNS social networking accounts.
Social Media Etiquette
Whether using social media personally or on behalf of ACNS, it is important to be mindful of the way comments can be construed. These guidelines are designed to capture some of the more common practices when it comes to social media etiquette.
General Recommendations
Always express ideas and opinions in a respectful manner.
All communications should be in good taste;
Be sensitive when linking to outside content as redirecting to another site may imply endorsement of its content;
Be cautious not to denigrate or insult others.
Be transparent.
When posting content to a social media site without official approval from ACNS to act as a spokesperson, add a disclaimer to the effect of: "The opinions and positions expressed are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of ACNS."
Only individuals authorized by ACNS may use the ACNS logo in communications.
Protect confidential information and relationships. Online postings and conversations are not private; therefore:
Avoid identifying and discussing others, including employees, members, exhibitors and supporters, unless you have permission from the individual or entity;
Obtain permission before posting pictures of others, logos or other copyrighted information;
Never discuss proprietary information, or anything considered confidential.
Express your points in a clear, logical way. Given the nature of social media, a single comment can become a dialogue. When confronted with a difference of opinion, be careful to stay calm, correcting mistakes when warranted. Only ignore comments when it is clear that someone isn't interested in interacting with you and only wants to be inflammatory.
Attempt to add value. The posted content adds value if it improves the knowledge or skills of site users if it builds a sense of community or if it helps to promote ACNS’s values.
Privacy
Be careful with personal information.
Be familiar with the privacy settings on the social media platform, and make use of them to protect your information and content.
Never post something that would be offensive, hurtful, damaging or inappropriate if it were stated publicly.
