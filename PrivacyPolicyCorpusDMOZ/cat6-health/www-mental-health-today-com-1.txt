Health Today Privacy Policy
Mental Health only receives private information from users
when they write to apply for a volunteer position, submit
content or ask to receive services such as the BPD Today
Advocate Program. Email addresses are known by this website
after joining one of the email lists available. This
information is not shared with a third party.
Though Mental Health Today does not take letters from
consumers and families due to time constraints and the high
traffic, letters do occasionally come in. Users are advised
that their letters may not be answered. Some of these letters
are forwarded on to an agency or email volunteer who can
further assist the person.
Information sent in to be posted on the website are posted
anonymously unless it is clear that the poster asks to remain
unanonymous.

All means are taken to protect and ensure the privacy of
users. However if information is received that causes any
suspicion that someone is a danger to themselves, a danger to
others, or gravely disabled, appropriate agencies are
immediately contacted and information can be shared with our
volunteers.
Individuals may choose to take part in our discussion
boards. It is the users personal preference to share private
information publicly on those boards. Mental Health Today
cannot and will not be held responsible for the individual's
privacy in these cases.
Volunteers at Mental Health Today are instructed to protect
the privacy of each individual they encounter.
User's privacy is extremely important to Mental Health
Today.
