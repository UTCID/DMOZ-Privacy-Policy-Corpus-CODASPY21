EMDR Training Provider Policies & Guidelines
Home / EMDR Training & Education / EMDR Training / EMDR Training Provider Policies & Guidelines
EMDR Training Providers are responsible for adhering to and following current EMDR International Association Policies and the BTC Requirements.
TRAINING ELIGIBILITY
Providers are responsible for ensuring their training participants meet the eligibility requirements for EMDR basic training.
DISCLOSURE OF TRAINING COSTS
Providers must disclose the full cost of the entire EMDR basic training to prospective participants up front and prior to registration. If consultation hours are not included in the registration fees, providers must provide an estimated range for the out of pocket cost for completing the 10 consultation hours. This information must be included in promotional training advertisement materials.
CANCELLATION & REFUND POLICIES
Providers must make their cancellation and refund policies available and accessible to prospective participants. These policies should be clear and transparent up front, prior to registration. This information must be included in promotional training advertisement materials.
GRIEVANCE PROCESS
Providers must have a process in place to review and respond to complaints and grievances should they arise. This information should be made easily accessible to participants.
PARTICIPANT AGREEMENT
Providers are encouraged to have a participant agreement form so prospective trainees understand what’s expected and how to prepare themselves prior to the first day of training.
2 YEAR TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION OF TRAINING
Participants who begin the EMDR training must complete the entire training within 24 months from their initial start date. This information should be clear and transparent up front, prior to registration. This information must be included in promotional training advertisement materials.
CONSULTATION HOURS
Providers must inform prospective participants that 10 hours of consultation are required in order to complete the EMDR training. Providers are required to disclose whether the consultation hours are included in the registration fees or if training participants will need to pay separate additional fees for the consultation hours. Providers must also disclose whether prospective participants will have to schedule consultation hours on their own time outside of the training or if the consultation hours are integrated into the course and provided during the scheduled training dates. This information must be included in promotional training advertisement materials.
If participants are paying separately for and obtain consultation hours on their own time outside of the training, they must be provided with detailed information about the consultation process. Providers are expected to supply the names and contact information of those consultants who can provide the consultation hours for their training.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
Providers must comply with EMDR International Association’s policy on Diversity and Cultural Competence and create a supportive environment for training regardless of an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture or religion, and not engage in discriminatory behavior or bias. Providers should address issues of cultural diversity during the EMDR training as appropriate.
EQUAL ACCESS
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination and ensures equal opportunity for persons with disabilities. Providers are responsible for ensuring that facilities and reasonable accommodations are accessible to those with disabilities. This information must be included in promotional training advertisement materials.
