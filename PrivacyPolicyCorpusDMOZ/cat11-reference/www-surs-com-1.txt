This information is used solely to help us improve our online services by determining how often our website is visited and which areas of the site are visited most to gauge overall interest. All information is used exclusively by SURS, but may be shared with other State agencies to perform the duties and obligations imposed by the Illinois Pension Code. None of the information we collect is sold or disclosed to third parties unless it is required to fulfill a request made in accordance to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act or in response to audit inquiries.
For site security purposes and to ensure that the site remains available to all users, SURS uses software to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

E-mail communications to and from SURS are not protected by these security measures. SURS does not warrant the security of information on other websites that you may visit by linking to a different web address.
Social Security Numbers
SURS uses its own Member Identification numbers for the majority of our member communications to help protect your identity. However, SURS has to collect Social Security Numbers ("SSNs") for federal tax-reporting purposes associated with payment of benefits and refunds. Rest assured that SURS understands your concerns related to identity theft and has policies and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of your Social Security number that comply with Illinois and Federal law.
We will not:
Sell, lease, trade, or rent SSNs to a third party for any purpose;
Publicly post or display SSNs;
Print SSNs on any card required for SURS members to access SURS services;
Require anyone to transmit SSNs over the Internet, unless the connection is secure or the SSN is encrypted;
Print SSNs on any materials mailed, unless State or Federal law requires that the SSN be on the documents mailed, or unless SURS is confirming the accuracy of the SSN;
Collect, use or disclose SSNs unless required by State or Federal law or for the performance of the duties and responsibilities of SURS;
Require a member to use his or her SSN to access the SURS Web site; or
Use the SSN for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected.
We may:
Disclose SSNs if required by a court order, warrant, or subpoena;
Disclose SSNs to reciprocal retirement systems or other government agencies to perform SURS duties and responsibilities with regard to the SURS member;
Collect, use, or disclose SSNs to verify the SSN for SURS internal processes;
Disclose SSNs as required by law; or
Collect SSNs to locate an inactive or dormant member to pay a benefit from SURS.
