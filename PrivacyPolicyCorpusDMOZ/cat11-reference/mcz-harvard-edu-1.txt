The following discloses information gathering and dissemination practices for the MCZ for this public Website (www.mcz.harvard.edu), affiliated public Websites (publications.mcz.harvard.edu; digir.mcz.harvard.edu; mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu) and related authenticated Websites (including but not limited to mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu; code.mcz.harvard.edu; skrifa.mcz.harvard.edu).
Information gathering
Some of the listed sites use Google Analytics and your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the Harvard network. For the public Websites, we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous. For the authenticated Websites, after user login to any application, all use of the system can be monitored and logged by user login and IP address. All users of these systems expressly consent to such monitoring.
Use of Information
The MCZ staff uses the information gathered above to tailor site content to user needs, and to generate aggregate statistical reports. For the public Websites, at no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. For the authenticated Websites, we use your IP address to monitor user needs and to diagnose issues.
