Sharing Cookies and Digital Personal Data with Third Parties
The University has relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through the my.Widener.edu portal or other web services. In order to facilitate your access to these services, the University may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service so that you may access third-party services without re-entering your Widener user ID and password, or other required information, each time.
We use the information we get from web analytics tools such as Google Analytics to improve the user experience or our website. These tools collect data such as browser information, operating system, and page views through the implementation of session cookies or persistent cookies. Each tool creates a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. The cookie is only used by Widener University and/or the software publisher of the respective tool. The software publisher’s ability to use and share information collected about your visits to Widener University websites is restricted by each software publisher’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policies.
Digital Marketing and Ad Networks
We may sometimes use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Data with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of digital Personal Data. A longer list of some of the technologies used for advertising and other purposes on our website and in our mobile apps are listed under the "Technologies Used" section.
Third Parties May Collect Personal Data from Other Sources
Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.
Do-Not-Track
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.
Your Privacy and Ad Choices
You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out feature, located at: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.
As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

If you send us email, we may share your email address and message content with others inside the University, and with persons and organizations outside the University, to the extent it is necessary to process and/or address your inquiry, or serve your needs.

The University may also share your email address and message content with others outside the University to the extent necessary to comply with legal investigations and/or to protect the University’s rights and interests.
