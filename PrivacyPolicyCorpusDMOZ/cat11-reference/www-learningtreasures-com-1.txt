Learning Treasures Privacy Policy
By Belinda J Mooney
Updated July 22, 2008
Learning Treasures does not personally collect ANY private information from
its visitors, other than an email address for those who sign-up for the opt-in
newsletters. We do not sell or give newsletter emails to anyone.
Learning Treasures affiliates with "Ads by Google" and other third party
ad servers. Anonymous data for marketing purposes is sometimes collected through
the technology of cookies and web beacons via these advertisers to enhance the
visitor experience and conduct general market research. Learning Treasuresdoes not participate in data collection (beyond customary website statistics),
but third party advertising hosts (like Google AdWords) on our websites may do
so from time to time. For more information on Google's use of aggregated,
non-personal information and other marketing data collection techniques, go
