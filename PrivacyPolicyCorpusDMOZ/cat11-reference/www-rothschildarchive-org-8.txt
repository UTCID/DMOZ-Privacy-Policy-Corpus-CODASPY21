7: Legal agreements
Legal agreements were forged between Gustave and Edouard de Rothschild settling the estate of Alphonse de Rothschild in 1905.
These documents set out the value and contents of the Rothschild stables, jointly-owned by Gustave and Alphonse. The stables comprise training stables in rue St Laurent in Chantilly and in rue de la Source in Gouvieux together with stud farms at Meautry and Celle St Cloud. The total value of all the horses amounts to 149,400,000 francs.
Certificates for the French Stud Book detail each thoroughbred horse's name, date of birth, dam and sire and owner. One of earliest is for the horse Heaume which was jointly owned by Gustave and Alphonse de Rothschild, and which won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1890.
