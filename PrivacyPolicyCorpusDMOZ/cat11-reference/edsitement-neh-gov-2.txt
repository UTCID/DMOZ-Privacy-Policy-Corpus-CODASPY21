Who We Are
"EDSITEment" is a World Wide Website for humanities education developed and maintained by the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal government agency, for the benefit of parents, students, and teachers.
EDSITEment provides access to educational websites which, as judged by a panel of experts, were selected solely on the basis of educational excellence in the humanities and high-quality website design. EDSITEment is not a complete course in any humanities discipline, nor does it attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of the humanities. EDSITEment does not prescribe a specific course of study nor advocate any educational theory. EDSITEment is intended solely to be an educational resource for teachers, parents, and students.
The text, images and other materials in the websites linked to EDSITEment were reviewed by a panel of experts and found to be educationally appropriate for users of all ages. Recognizing that the World Wide Web is a dynamic, interactive, and exploratory environment for humanities education, the humanities content of the linked sites may change and expand over time. The National Endowment for the Humanities reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time.
