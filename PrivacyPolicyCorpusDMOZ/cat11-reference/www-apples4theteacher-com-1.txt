Privacy
of Children Online
We
do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information
on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our
systems immediately. Apples4theteacher.com encourages parents to go online with
their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:
Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent
or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.
Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
If your child uses
social media sites and mobile devices - review the privacy settings for your child's safety.
Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child's information is
treated.
