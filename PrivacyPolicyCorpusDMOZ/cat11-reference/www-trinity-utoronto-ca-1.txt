Trinity College is committed to the protection of privacy and respects the privacy of its students, faculty, staff, alumni and donors as well as that of other persons using services it provides. As a federated college with the University of Toronto, Trinity College collects only personal information that is essential to fulfill its mandate and does so under the authority of the Act to Incorporate Trinity College (1851, as amended 1928) and Royal Charter of Trinity College (1852).
Trinity College’s Privacy Officer develops and supports the Records Management program to assist staff members in the effective creation, use and maintenance of College records. The program aims to provide management of College records throughout their lifecycle, in accordance with best practices, College policies, and compliance with pertinent legislation.
