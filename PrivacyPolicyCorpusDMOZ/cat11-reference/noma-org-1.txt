LAST UPDATED: September 6, 2018
The New Orleans Museum of Art (“NOMA”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors. This policy governs the way we electronically collect and use information both online and offline, including when you visit our websites, use a NOMA kiosk or use a NOMA application (collectively referred to as the “NOMA Website”). This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal data we collect, how we may use and share the data, and the privacy choices that you have with respect to our handling of personal data about you.
This Privacy Policy governs all persons (“Users” or “you”) who use the NOMA Website. Please read the entire Privacy Policy carefully. By using the NOMA Website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of NOMA’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (collectively “NOMA Policies”). If you do not agree with the NOMA Policies, please cease all use of the NOMA Website.
Please note that the NOMA Policies may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and your continued usage after any changes represents your agreement to the new terms. Please review the Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make material changes to this policy, we will strive to provide notice ahead of such changes, such as through emails or through a notice on the NOMA Website.
How we collect and use the information you provide
We collect and use the information you provide to personalize the NOMA Website so that we can better meet your needs, fulfill your online order, facilitate customer service, inform you of products and promotional offers, analyze trends; collect statistics; prevent misuse; comply with legal obligations; and for general business operations.
Information about the content you visit and services you use may be used alone or in conjunction with information collected from other users to help NOMA tailor the NOMA Website to better suit the needs and interests of you and other Users.
I. How We Collect Information
The term “Personal Data” includes information that has been provided by Users through the NOMA Website to NOMA, when a User creates a NOMA Website account, makes a purchase, communicates electronically with us, or otherwise. Personal Data does not include data from which you can no longer be identified due to encryption or anonymity.
We may collect Personal Data from various sources, including:
Directly from you, at your direction or with your consent;
Through information and content you provide;
From companies that organize events or programs with NOMA to which you have provided Personal Data;
From our vendors and other third parties who join with NOMA in initiatives and projects (such as advertisers, fellowship sponsors, etc.) to which you have provided Personal Data; and
Automatically as you navigate through the site
We maintain the data that you provide in databases that are secured using commercially-reasonable, industry standard protections. Our collection and use of visitor information varies with the type of visit or transaction.
II. Online retail purchases
When you order a product from the NOMA online store, you will need to provide your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card information to process your order. NOMA does not access or receive your credit card information. Your credit card information is received directly by our third-party payment card processors and service providers to perform fraud detection and payment processing services. If your purchase is rejected by our website because it was detected as a possible fraudulent use of a payment card, and you are in fact the authorized user of the card, you can contact us at museumshop@noma.org or call (504) 658-4116 for the issue to be evaluated and resolved. We will retain your name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, and email address provided for our records, in order to facilitate better customer service, and to inform you of our products and promotional offers. You may opt out of receiving these communications from NOMA by following the instructions in those emails. You may also contact NOMA at privacy@noma.org to request removal from NOMA’s promotional communications lists.
III. Online memberships and donations
When you purchase a NOMA membership or make a donation to NOMA online, we will ask you to provide us with the information we need to process your membership and/or to acknowledge your contribution. This information includes your name, billing and mailing addresses, telephone number, email address, and credit card information. NOMA does not access or receive your credit card information. Your credit card information is received directly by our third-party payment card processors and service providers to perform fraud detection and payment processing services. If your purchase is rejected by our website because it was detected as a possible fraudulent use of a payment card, and you are in fact the authorized user of the card, you can contact us at  membership@NOMA.org or call (504) 658-4127 for the issue to be evaluated and resolved. We will retain your personally identifiable information for our records, in order to facilitate better customer service. To process payments for members who have selected automatic renewal, the payment information will be stored using an encrypted token that is only accessible in unencrypted format by our third party processors, until such time that either the payment information expires (when we will contact you to update it), or the auto-renewal of the membership is canceled by you. In certain cases, you may be asked for additional information to complete your request, such as the names and birth dates (month/year) of your children if obtaining a Family membership or any Contributing membership with children (see “Children 13 and under”).
We may share the names and postal addresses we receive from members and donors with other nonprofit organizations. If you do not want to have your information used in this way, you may send an email message containing your name and postal address to membership@NOMA.org. Please see Section VII for further information on how NOMA may share your Personal Data.
IV. Online purchases of Museum admission tickets, event tickets, and course registrations
NOMA works with third-party contractors to process ticketing for certain events or registration for certain courses. NOMA contractually requires its vendors to maintain the security of the information which you provide to them and restricts the vendors from using this information in any way not expressly authorized by NOMA.
The Privacy Policy only applies to the NOMA Website and not the services provided by third-party contractors or processors. To the extent that the NOMA Website makes use of other applications or services, regardless of ownership by NOMA, the Privacy Policy only applies to the NOMA Website. The NOMA Policies do not apply to third party services. We suggest contacting the third parties and any other utilized service or application directly for information on their privacy policies
Automatic Data Collection
As you navigate through and interact with the NOMA Website, automatic data collection technology may be used to collect certain non-personal information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personally-identifiable information. This helps NOMA improve the NOMA Website and deliver a better, more personalized service, including enabling us to: estimate audience size and usage patterns; store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize the NOMA Website according to your individual interests; speed up your searches; and recognize you when you return to the Website. The type of information that may automatically be collected includes: use information (e.g., traffic data, access times, logs, pages viewed, and other communication data and resources that you access and use); and device information (e.g., IP address, operating system, type of electronic device, unique device identifier, serial number, and browser type).
In order to perform this automatic data collection, we use various technologies including cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. In order to use all the features of the NOMA website, we recommend that you accept cookies.
Specific instances where cookies are used include, but are not limited to the following:

X. Content Submitted by Users
Some features of the NOMA Website may allow you to post content on our websites or mobile apps, or social media pages, such as product reviews (“User Content”). Content that you provide may be shared publicly or with other users or third parties.
The User Content that you submit is posted and transmitted at your own risk. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, NOMA cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share the User Content.

For questions regarding these rights or the Privacy Policy, or if you would like to exercise any of these rights provided under local law in your jurisdiction, please send us an email at privacy@noma.org.

To the extent provided by applicable law, you may withdraw any consent previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your Personal Data.  We will apply these preferences going forward.  In some circumstances, withdrawing consent to our use or disclosure of your Personal Data will mean that NOMA may no longer be able to provide you with services or information about programming or initiatives that may be of interest to you.
XIV. Access to and Correcting Personal Data
You may access the data we maintain about you by submitting a request to privacy@noma.org.  Unless applicable law prohibits that disclosure, we will provide you with a copy of the Personal Data we maintain about you in the ordinary course of business, in a commonly used format.  You may request to correct any errors in your Personal Data.  We may reject your request to access or correct Personal Data, as permitted by applicable law.  If we reject your request, we will notify you of the reason(s) for the rejection.
XV. Deletion of Personal Data
You may request that we delete your Personal Data.  We may reject your request, as permitted by applicable law.  For example, NOMA may be required by legal, tax or other reasons to retain your Personal Data in its business or donation records.  If we reject your request, we will notify you of the reason(s) for the rejection.
XVI. Exceptions
This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the NOMA Website, any ideas for new programs, exhibits, or modifications to existing services, posts made on NOMA’s social media accounts, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”), that by its nature is accessible or intended to be accessible to other users of the NOMA Website.
All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. We cannot and will not be responsible for what third parties do with any User Data or other information that you choose to make publicly available. As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what information you choose to make publicly available through the NOMA Website.
The NOMA website may include links to websites operated by third parties over which we have no control. Once you leave the NOMA website, the NOMA Privacy Policy will not apply, and you access such sites at your own risk.
XVII. Emailing NOMA
If you send an email to NOMA, your message and email address may be saved and we may send you emails in order to respond to your message. Any material, business information, ideas, concepts, or other information sent to NOMA by email will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. We will only use the information provided in your email and your email address to improve the NOMA website, services, and products, and to fulfill or respond to your requests for products, services, or information.
XVIII. Third parties
Please be aware that our site may contain links to other sites hosted by third parties. Different rules may apply to their collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those third parties that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review other websites’ policies before revealing any personally identifiable or sensitive information.
XIX. Online surveys
From time to time, NOMA may invite you to participate in surveys posted on the NOMA website or sent to you by email. You may decide whether you wish to complete such surveys, which may ask about your background, occupation, or similar questions. We use this information to help us better understand our audience, which in turn allows us to better meet your needs and interests. Information collected in these surveys is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties for marketing purposes, but we may share it with outside vendors to analyze the information we collect.
XX. Media and Embedded Content
If you upload images to the NOMA Website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the NOMA Website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
XXI. Data Security
NOMA takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided to us through the NOMA Website from loss, misuses, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including through restriction of access to Personal Data to our employees, contractors, agents, and consultants who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve the NOMA Website. NOMA maintains reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we maintain. Despite these efforts, however, no organization, including NOMA, can fully eliminate risks, guarantee the security of Personal Data, or ensure transmissions will be error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from NOMA may not be secure. Therefore, you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the NOMA Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the NOMA Website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any User of the NOMA Website.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the NOMA Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the NOMA Website.
XXII. Location in the United States
NOMA operates its website and services from the United States of America and stores the information we collect in the United States of America. As such, the recipients of your Personal Data may be located outside of the jurisdiction where you personally reside. The laws of the United States may not provide the same level of protection as your home country. By providing us with information about yourself, you acknowledge the disclosure of such personal information to these recipients. Any processing of your personal information outside of your jurisdiction shall be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
XXIII. Notification to California Residents
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are residents of the State of California in the United States to annually request and obtain, at no charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. This information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request to privacy@noma.org.
XXIV. Email disclosure
If you have provided us with your email address, we may send you emails in order to alert you to information, events, activities, or programs at or related to NOMA that we believe may be of interest to you, or to alert you about sales or other promotional events at the NOMA online store. If you do not want us to use your email address to contact you for these purposes, you may send an email message containing your name and postal address to requests@noma.org.
