The College is not required to provide copies of records unless it is not reasonably convenient for students to inspect their records.Students have the right to request that the College correct records believed to be inaccurate or misleading. If the College decides, in response to such a request, not to amend a student’s record, the student has the right to a formal hearing before the Dean of Student Services.
