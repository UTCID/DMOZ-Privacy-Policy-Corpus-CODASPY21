Microsoft Buys Credentica U-Prove
It was announced today that Microsoft has purchased Credntica's U-Prove technology.Trust (and privacy) is a key aspect of connectedness.
We share more with people we trust and less with those we don't.
As Kim Cameron puts it, U-Prove works on a "need to know" basis.
If a web site proves worthy we might share more details and the Info Card with U-Prove will make that easier to accomplish.We will eventually see adoption of Info Cards as a mechanism.
Adoption is slow but this bit of news will undoubtedly move things along.
