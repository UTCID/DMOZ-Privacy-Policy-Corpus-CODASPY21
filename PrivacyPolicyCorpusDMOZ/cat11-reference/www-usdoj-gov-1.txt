The Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management  (OARM) leads Justice’s outreach and recruitment efforts for law students and attorneys with the goal of attracting a highly-qualified and diverse talent pool.
Opportunities for Law Students & Entry-Level Attorneys
Volunteer Legal Intern Opportunities
Justice selects about 1800 volunteer interns each year. Approximately 800 interns volunteer during each academic year, and roughly 1000 interns volunteer each summer. These positions are uncompensated but are highly sought after because of the responsibility and experience they offer.
Summer Law Intern Program
The Attorney General's Summer Law Intern Program is Justice's competitive, centralized recruitment program for compensated summer internships.  The majority of SLIP hires are second year law students who work at Justice the summer between their second and third years of law school.  The SLIP is also open to recent graduates between graduation and the start of a judicial clerkship or full-time qualifying legal fellowship.
The Attorney General’s Honors Program for Entry-Level Attorneys
The Attorney General’s Honors Program is Justice’s competitive, centralized recruitment program that is the only way for new attorneys (i.e., third-year law students and students who enter judicial clerkships, graduate law programs, or qualifying fellowships within 9 months of law school graduation) to enter Justice in an attorney position.
Opportunities for Experienced Attorneys
The Department of Justice offers a broad range of opportunities for experienced attorneys to work on many significant and complex issues that face our nation. Our lawyers work in virtually every area of legal practice.
As a general rule, an attorney who is an active member of the bar of any U.S. jurisdiction and has at least one year post-J.D. legal or other relevant experience is eligible for experienced attorney position. Nevertheless, some attorney positions require greater experience and additional eligibility criteria.
