1.  What is « Personal Information » ?
Personal information is information about you that uniquely identifies you as an individual. Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number are all examples of personal information. However, the name, address and telephone number of an individual that appears in a telephone directory that is available to the public (where such individual can refuse to have such information appears in such directory) does not fall under the scope of personal information as it is publicly available information. Also, in some circumstances, some of this information may qualify as business information which is not covered by this Statement.

Personal information is only obtained online if you supply it voluntarily, usually through contacting us via e-mail, applying online for a contest, answering online surveys, submitting a posting to a blog, forum, or review or registering for services. You are not required to supply personal information to view the content of any YP Website. You should also be aware that when you share personal information in public areas of a YP Website, this information may be seen and used by others users. We urge you to exercise good judgment when sharing personal information in these areas.
If you decide not to provide us with personal information online, no material consequences will result, although you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, receive product information, or use portions of a YP Website that require personalized information or applications. YP Websites provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request contact information about you.
