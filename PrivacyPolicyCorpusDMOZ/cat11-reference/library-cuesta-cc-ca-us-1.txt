Security and Personal Privacy
Transaction Security
When you are performing credit card transactions on the Cuesta College Web Site, you
are utilizing our secure server, which encrypts all of your personal information,
including name, address, and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can
access or use your personal information. With encryption the information cannot be
read as it travels over the Internet. Additionally, credit card numbers are used only
for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. We collect only the
information required to process orders. When your credit card information is transmitted
to our Merchant Service for validation, it is encrypted and only our Merchant Service
has the key that will unencrypt that data. Please keep in mind that e-mail does not
use SSL encryption technology and we advise against sending credit card information
to us via e-mail. We will not be responsible for the confidentiality of any personal
or credit card information transmitted via e-mail.
Our 128-bit encryption is implemented on SSL 3.0 with a certificate from Thawte and
IPSCA. SSL encryption is active in all areas where credit card transaction information
is requested. You can check to see that you have entered an SSL-active area by looking
on the bottom of your screen. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending
on your browser), you will know that SSL technology is in place and ready to encrypt
your information. How to check if you are on a secure page? Look up at your address
line at the top of your browser page for the (http://). You will notice in the address
line, that there is an (https://) rather than an (http://). The (s) indicates that
you are on a secure page. Also, you'll see a key or a closed lock icon depending on
your browser. These symbols tell you that any information you send to us will be "scrambled"
using SSL technology. SSL uses "Public-Key Encryption" to exchange a session key between
you and our server. This session key is used to encrypt (or scramble) your transaction
twice - when it is sent and when it is received. If you are using a security-enabled
browser, your information is secure. Please note that in some systems, such as myCuesta
registration and payment screens, the secure window is wrapped in a frame and therefore
the security symbols may not necessarily appear. These pages are still using SSL technology,
and your protection is top priority.
How we collect information
When you visit our Web pages or utilize transaction features on our site, Cuesta College's
web servers automatically collect information about you. Some information is detected
electronically, and is collected without your direct input. Other information may
be voluntarily provided by you as you place an order, fill out forms (personal information,
meeting or course registration, guest book, parking registration, etc.), or send us
e-mail.

Optimize the site for common browsers used to access the site
The above information is used by software programs on our Web Site to create summary
statistics which allow us to assess the number of visitors to the different sections
of our site, identify what information is of most and least interest, determine technical
design specifications, monitor system performance, and help us make our site more
useful to visitors.
Information you voluntarily provide via interactive web based forms
There are several transaction sites on the Cuesta College web site that allow users
to send money to the college. These transactions involve submission of some kind of
electronic form. When you use online (or traditional printed) forms, you voluntarily
provide Cuesta College with the following information:
Your name
Home and/or work postal addresses
Home and/or work phone
Home and/or work email addresses

Additional information may be gathered, depending on the nature of the form. This
information may include, but not be limited to, the following:

Information you provide when you send us e-mail
When you send us e-mail and request a response, we use the e-mail address you have
provided to respond to your inquiry. We may periodically log the nature of these e-mail
requests to help us analyze visitor interests overall and identify areas for improvement
on the site.
You also may decide to send us personally identifying information, (for example your
mailing address) in an electronic mail message requesting that information be mailed
to you. Information collected in this manner is used solely for responding to requests
for information or records. We may forward your E-mail to other Cuesta employees who
are better able to respond to you.
