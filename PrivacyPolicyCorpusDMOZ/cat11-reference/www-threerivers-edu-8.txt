HomeAboutPoliciesRefund of Tuition and Fees
Refund of Tuition and Fees
Student will receive a full refund of tuition and fees if the College cancels a course.
Refund of Tuition Only
Please refer to the Academic Calendar or the website for refund deadlines. Requests for refunds of tuition must be directed to the Registrar’s Office by mail, e-mail (registrar@trcc.commnet.edu) or fax (860-886-6670). Students should retain a confirmation receipt for their records.
Withdrawal and reduced course load requests may also be made in person at the Registrar’s office during normal business hours.
Note: College Service and Student Activity fees are not refundable unless the college cancels the course.
Fall and Spring Full Semester Courses
Students who wish to drop all registered courses and receive a refund shall direct their request to the Registrar’s Office. If the written notice is received prior to the first day of classes for the semester, 100% of the tuition for all dropped courses will be refunded. If written notice is received on or after the first day of classes for the semester through the first 14-calendar days of the semester, a 50% refund of tuition will be made.
Fall and Spring Module Courses
Students wishing to drop from modular courses with beginning and ending dates which do not correspond to the full semester schedule are required to direct their request to the Registrar’s Office. This must be done prior to the first scheduled class meeting in order to receive a 100% refund of tuition. A 50% refund of tuition will be granted if written notice is received according to the following schedule:
1 week module – within the first day of the module
5 week module – within the first 5 calendar days of the module
6 week module – within the first 6 calendar days of the module
7 week module – within the first 7 calendar days of the module
8 week module – within the first 8 calendar days of the module
Reduction in Course Load
For a reduction in course load which occurs on the first day of classes and through the fourteenth calendar day of that semester, 50% of the difference of the tuition applicable to the original and revised schedule will be refunded.
Reduction in Course Load for Financial Aid Students
Financial Aid students who reduce their course load will incur the same costs as non-financial aid students, but these costs and credits are not included in determining their financial aid amount. Awards are based on the number of credits the student is registered for at the conclusion of the add/drop period. Please contact the Financial Aid office if you have any questions.
Summer and Winter Session Courses Supported by the Educational Extension Fund
Students who wish to drop all registered summer or winter session courses shall direct their written requests for course drops and refunds to the Registrar’s Office. One hundred percent of tuition will be refunded if notice is received prior to 4:00 p.m. on the day preceding the first scheduled class meeting (requests must be received by 4:00 p.m. Friday for courses that meet first on Monday). No refund of tuition will be granted if the notice is received on or after the first day of class.
Refund Exceptions
A 100% refund of tuition and fees is granted to students who enter the armed services before earning degree credit for that semester. In this case, notice and a certified copy of enlistment papers must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office. No other refund of tuition will be granted for either full-time or part-time students beyond the 14th calendar day after the first day of classes. Exceptions to the tuition refund policy due to extenuating or extraordinary circumstances will be considered upon written request submitted to the Dean of Administration via mail or email (waiverrequest@threerivers.edu). Please provide your full name and student I.D. in the subject line along with a detailed request, contact information and backup documentation which can be attached to the email or faxed (860-215-9901).
Repayment Policy for all Federal Aid Recipients
Effective October 2000, regulations governing the administration of Federal Title IV Financial Aid Funds (i.e. Perkins Loan, Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and Family Educational Loan Program) have changed significantly. All students receiving this federal student aid who withdraw or stop attending all classes prior to the 60% point of the semester will be required to return and repay a portion of this funding.
In case of early withdrawal, the college is required to recalculate that student’s financial aid eligibility and determine what percentage of federal aid has been earned based on the date of the student’s withdrawal. (This percentage is directly proportional to the number of calendar days attended by the student divided by the number of calendar days in the semester.) Any “unearned” federal aid must be returned as follows:
Any “unearned” federal aid collected by the college for student tuition and fees: These funds must be returned in total to the Federal Government. The student will then become liable to the college for this amount and will be billed accordingly.
Any “unearned” federal aid paid directly to the student or on the student’s behalf (bookstore charges, daycare, transportation, etc.): 50% of this debt will be forgiven, but the remaining 50% must be repaid to the Federal Government by the student within 45 days.
Since these Federal Title IV Regulations must be strictly enforced, all participating students are urged to take the following action to prevent potential problems in this area:
Work closely with the Financial Aid Office to understand their rights and responsibilities under the new regulations.
Work closely with their academic advisor in selecting courses and determining reasonable academic loads for each semester.
Consider the demands of work and family when deciding how many courses to take.
Attend classes and maintain satisfactory academic progress as required. Failure to attend classes and to comply with these financial aid regulations will permanently jeopardize future eligibility for federal assistance.
Residency Requirement
To be entitled to the in-state tuition rates established for Connecticut residents, a student must be a Connecticut resident for a minimum of 12 months, with the exception of active duty military personnel and their families and those who meet the New England Board of Higher Education (RSP/NEBHE) guidelines. International students issued an I-20 and those on temporary work visas are not entitled to the in-state tuition rates for Connecticut residents.
