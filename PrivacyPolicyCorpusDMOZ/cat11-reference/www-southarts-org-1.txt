Terms of Use
South Arts ("SOUTH ARTS," "we," "us," or "our") owns, administers and operates the southarts.org and jazzroad.org websites ("Sites") and grants application and reporting portal (“Portal”). The Sites and Portal (collectively, the “Services”) are provided in partnership with the state arts agencies of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The purpose of the Services is advancing Southern vitality through the arts.
These Terms and Conditions of Use ("TCU" or "Agreement") govern your use of the Services identified above. Other sites, content or online services owned or controlled by SOUTH ARTS may have their own terms and conditions of use and should be reviewed.
SOUTH ARTS may also offer promotions, sweepstakes, contests, services or features that have their own terms, and to the extent any portion of those special terms conflict with these TCU, the special terms will govern for that specific portion.
This Agreement is made by and between SOUTH ARTS and you, the user of the Services. The Services are intended for adults 18 years of age or older. By accessing the Services, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older. Use of the Services is provided to you subject to these Terms of Use, which may be updated, modified, or amended by SOUTH ARTS from time to time at our sole discretion with or without prior notice to you. In the event we make material changes to this Agreement, notice of the changes will be posted on the homepage of this Site and the revised TCU will take effect thirty days after their publication on this Site. You hereby agree as follows:
BY USING THIS SITE, CLICKING "I AGREE" IF YOU ARE A REGISTERED USER WHO CONTRIBUTES CONTENT OR INFORMATION, BY SUBMITTING A SEARCH REQUEST IF YOU ARE ONLY PERFORMING SEARCHES ON THE SERVICES, OR BY OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SOUTH ARTS’ PRIVACY POLICY, INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN, AND EXPRESSLY AGREE TO AND CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF HOW OFTEN YOU USE THE SERVICES.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TCU, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICES OR TO ACCESS THE SITES OR PORTAL. YOUR RIGHTS TO USE THE SERVICES ARE LIMITED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

You hereby give SOUTH ARTS the right, however, to create a deep link to certain pages on your website for the purpose of offering access to content that SOUTH ARTS, in our sole discretion, determines to be appropriate for the Services. Our Services may also provide links to other websites or third-party online services. These links are not intended to, and do not, imply any sponsorship or endorsement by SOUTH ARTS, even if we work collaboratively or cooperatively with an organization or entity to which our Services link. We do not exercise any control over the content on, or the operation of, these other external sites. We are not in any way responsible or liable, either directly or indirectly, for the availability or accessibility of these external sites, any transmissions initiated by or between you and such external site, any products or services sold on the other site (if any), any of the content posted on the other site, or your use of or reliance upon such content or links. Your use of any linked external site is at your own risk and is subject to the terms and conditions of use, privacy policies and other policies applicable to those external sites. If you discover a link on the Services which makes illegal or infringing content available to our users or other parties, please notify SOUTH ARTS so that we may determine, in our sole discretion and pursuant to Section 11, whether to remove, disable, or otherwise modify it. SOUTH ARTS may also allow interaction between the Services and other third-party services such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media providers. This may include “Like” buttons or other interactions through third party plugins on the Services that, when used, may allow you to share content from the Services or other content with other persons on or through third party sites or elsewhere. Please consult the privacy policies of these third-party services before using them to make sure you are comfortable with the level of sharing. SOUTH ARTS has no control over these third-party services and you use these interaction functions at your own risk. SOUTH ARTS is in no way liable for any harm to you as a result of using one of these interaction functions.
8. License from You to SOUTH ARTS. SOUTH ARTS does not accept unsolicited information, ideas or other content you may attempt to transmit to SOUTH ARTS directly. As such, we take no responsibility for such transmitted content. SOUTH ARTS is not required to treat any such transmitted content as confidential. If you do send SOUTH ARTS unsolicited content, you hereby agree that SOUTH ARTS owns a perpetual, unlimited, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, assignable, and worldwide right and license, to make, copy, perform, publish, display, distribute, transmit, translate, modify, prepare derivative works and use the content in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereinafter developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content. You also agree to waive and never assert any moral rights that you may have in any content submitted to SOUTH ARTS. This license includes any right of publicity rights that may be present in any content you transmit to SOUTH ARTS.
9. Unacceptable Use and Content Policy. By using the Services, you may need to interact with other users of the Services. You are solely responsible for any and all interactions, acts and omissions that occur while you use the Services, and you agree to use the Services in a manner that is legal, respectable and consistent with these TCU. You agree that you shall not engage in, or directly or indirectly assist anyone else in engaging in, any unacceptable, inappropriate or illegal uses, which includes, but is not limited to, use of the Services to: (i) post, disseminate, store or transmit unsolicited messages, chain letters, or unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as “spam”); (ii) post, disseminate or transmit content that is abusive, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, harassing, grossly offensive, vulgar, threatening, or malicious; (iii) post, disseminate, store, or transmit files, text, graphics, software, or other content that actually or potentially infringes the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, intellectual property rights, contract rights or rights of privacy or publicity of any person or entity, or instruct any person on how to do so; (iv) post, disseminate, or transmit any false, fraudulent, inaccurate, or deceptive information; (v) create a false identity or otherwise attempt to mislead any person as to the identity or origin of any communication; (vi) impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a SOUTH ARTS employee or agent; (vii) export, re-export, or permit downloading or transfer of any message or content in violation of any export or import law, regulation or restriction of the United States and its agencies or authorities, or without all required approvals, licenses or exemptions; (viii) interfere, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to other passwords or accounts on the Services or on any other computer network; (ix) post, disseminate, store, or transmit viruses, Trojan horses, or any other malicious or damaging code or program; (x) harm minors in any way; (xi) solicit personal data from anyone under eighteen (18) years of age; (xii) solicit, post, disseminate, or transmit any confidential information; (xiii) interfere with or disrupt the Services, servers, or network connected to provide service to the Services; (xiv) provide instructional information about illegal or unlawful products, services, or activities; (xv) "stalk," bully, or otherwise harass another person; (xvi) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international laws; (xvii) delete, modify, or revise any material posted by another party or user without authorization; and/or (xviii) engage in any other activity deemed by SOUTH ARTS , in our sole discretion, to be objectionable or unacceptable.
One or more violations of the prohibitions in this policy may result in termination or suspension of your access to and ability to use the Services, where applicable. The previous list of prohibitions is not exclusive. SOUTH ARTS reserves the right to terminate your access to any portion of the Services for any reason.
Our Sites are being hosted by Digital Ocean, a third party service provider, which may also have an acceptable use policy to which SOUTH ARTS is bound. This policy, if applicable, is expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it applies to your conduct while using our Services. Any violation of this acceptable use policy, if any, by you shall constitute a violation of this section. For more information, you may view the host’s website at: https://www.digitalocean.com/
As stated in SOUTH  ARTS’s Privacy Policy, in instances where SOUTH ARTS , in our sole discretion, suspect or determine that the Services are being used for any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purposes, personal data relating to your use of the Services may be disclosed to other parties as SOUTH ARTS deems appropriate. Such information may also be disclosed pursuant to any authorized law enforcement investigation or other judicial process, regardless of whether it was initiated by SOUTH ARTS or by another party. Unless expressly required by law, SOUTH ARTS has no obligation to inform you if we receive a subpoena or other authorized judicial or legal process compelling the disclosure of your personal data or other information. SOUTH ARTS may, however, in our sole discretion, choose to inform you in certain instances.
10. No Pre-Screening. You understand that SOUTH ARTS is a passive conduit for any online distribution and publication of information or content submitted by you and other users on or through the Services, and that, although we reserve the right to do so, SOUTH ARTS does not screen information or content in advance of submission. We do not pre-screen any users who provide information to you (or you to them) or may otherwise respond to you. Such communication between you and other users occurs without SOUTH ARTS’s knowledge or intervention at that time. We have not verified, confirmed, investigated, or corroborated any information exchanged between you and other users. You assume sole risk and responsibility for contributing information to other users of the Services and for answering, contacting, investigating, meeting, interacting with, soliciting, and/or transacting business with any other users of the Services or other respondents to your information. SOUTH ARTS is not responsible for the conduct of any other user who may interact with you, regardless of whether such interaction occurs through the Services.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SOUTH ARTS BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OF DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT CONTRIBUTED, DISSEMINATED, RECEIVED, OR RELIED UPON BY YOU OR OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES.
11. Complaint Procedures Policy.
a. Policy. It is SOUTH ARTS’s policy not to allow any content on the Services which may constitute intellectual property infringement; violations of federal, state, or local law; obscene or defamatory material; or may otherwise be unacceptable, inappropriate, or inaccurate. Upon learning of the existence of such problematic content, SOUTH ARTS will attempt to delete, edit, remove, disable, change, or restrict access to or the availability of content, which, in SOUTH ARTS’s sole discretion, is unacceptable, objectionable, or inaccurate. SOUTH ARTS may or may not notify you about what action is taken with respect to the problematic content. The provisions of this section are intended to implement this policy but are not in any way intended to impose a contractual obligation upon SOUTH ARTS to undertake, or refrain from undertaking, any particular course of conduct.
b. Complaint Procedures. If you believe that any content available on or through the Services violates this policy or the Unacceptable Use and Content Policy in Section 9, you may notify SOUTH ARTS as follows: (i) via e-mail at communications@southarts.org; or (ii) via first class mail (or other nationally-recognized courier) at: South Arts, 1800 Peachtree St NW Suite 808, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, Attn: Communications Department.
In order to allow SOUTH ARTS to respond effectively, please provide us with as much information as possible in your e-mail or correspondence, including: (i) identification of the right(s) infringed or violated (including the registration numbers of any registered trademarks, copyrights or patents allegedly infringed) or the unacceptable or inappropriate content; (ii) all facts which lead you to believe that a right has been violated or infringed, if applicable; (iii) the precise location where the offending content is located; and (iv) any grounds to believe that the posting of such content was not authorized, if applicable.
c. Investigation/Liability Limitation. You agree that SOUTH ARTS has the right, but not the duty or obligation, to investigate any complaint received. By reserving this right, SOUTH ARTS does not undertake any responsibility in fact to investigate complaints or to remove, edit, disable, or restrict access to or the availability of content. SOUTH ARTS will not act on complaints that we believe, in our sole discretion, to be deficient or incomplete. SOUTH ARTS also reserves the right to comply and cooperate with any and all legal requirements, legal authorities, and/or law enforcement agencies regarding the investigation of, or request to disclose, information related to your use of the Services.
BY ACCEPTING THESE TCU, YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS SOUTH ARTS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY SOUTH ARTS DURING OR AS A RESULT OF SOUTH  ARTS’S INVESTIGATION AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER SOUTH ARTS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT CONTENT REMAINS ON THE SERVICES WHICH VIOLATES YOUR RIGHTS OR THESE TCU, AS STATED IN SECTION 14, YOUR SOLD AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST SOUTH ARTS SHALL BE TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.
