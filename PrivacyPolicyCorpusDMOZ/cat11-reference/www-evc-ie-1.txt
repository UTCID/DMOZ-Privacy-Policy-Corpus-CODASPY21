General statement
We respect your right to privacy. Visitors are advised that each time
they visit a Website, two general levels of information about their
visit can be retained. The first level comprises statistical and other
analytical information collected on an aggregate and non-individual
specific basis of all browsers who visit the site. The second is
information which is personal or particular to a specific visitor who
knowingly chooses to provide that information.
The statistical and analytical information provides general and not
individually specific information about the number of people who visit
this Website; the number of people who return to this site; the pages
that they visit; where they were before they came to this site and the
page in the site at which they exited. This information helps us
monitor traffic on our Website so that we can manage the site’s
capacity and efficiency. It also helps us to understand which parts of
this site are most popular and generally to assess user behaviour and
characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various
areas of the site.
Through this Website you may have an opportunity to send us
information, such as through the "registration" pages or any other area
where you may send e-mails, provide feedback, etc. By choosing to
participate in these, you will be providing us with some level of
personal information relating to you. This information will only be
used by this site for:
the purposes for which it was provided by you;
verification purposes and statistical analysis; and
marketing and administration purposes.
Collection and use of personal information
Personal information: information that is associated with your name or
personal identity. The this site Website does not collect any personal
data about you on this Website, apart from information which you
volunteer (for example, by emailing us, or registering with us). Any
information which you provide in this way is not made available to any
third parties, and is used by this site only in line with the purpose
for which you provided it.
Collection and use of non-personal information
Non-personal information: data collected for statistical purposes which
is not associated with a specific identity. This site collects and
analyses technical information in order to evaluate our Website. The
type of technical information we log is confined to the following:
The IP address*1 of the visitor’s Web server
The top-level domain-name used (for example .ie, .com, .org, .net)
The pages visited on the this site Website, i.e. URL’s*2 visited
The previous Website address from which the visitor reached us, including any search terms used
Clickstream data which shows the traffic of visitors around this Website (for example, pages accessed)
*1 An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such
as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route
information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words,
an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to
locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in
order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
*2 A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the global address of documents
and other resources on the World Wide Web.
