If you are in the European Union, or if your “Personal Data” otherwise may be subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), you should understand that we will use our technical infrastructure in the United States to deliver various services to you.  In order to fulfill our contract with you (if you are a visitor to our campus, an applicant, a student, an employee, an alumnus, a donor, a volunteer, a faculty member, a Trustee, and/or you are purchasing items from us online, etc.) we may need to transfer your “Personal Data” to the United States, and possibly to other jurisdictions outside of your home country, as necessary to provide these services.  Similarly, if you are browsing our webpage, we may collect certain “Personal Data” about you (for example, your ISP address) in order to enhance our webpage, and your experience on our webpage.  Processing of your Personal Data as you browse our webpage is necessary for our legitimate interests, and we believe these interests will not interfere with your fundamental rights or freedoms.  “Personal Data” generally means any information that can be used to identify a natural person.  For more information about how the GDPR affects you, please click here.
