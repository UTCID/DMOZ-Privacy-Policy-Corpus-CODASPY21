Data ProtectionUnder the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you.
Information you provide on the application / enrolment form will be passed to The Education & Skills Funding Agency, which is registered under the Data Protection Act 2018. The registration is primarily for the collection and analysis of statistical data but it also allows the Council to share information with other organisations for the purposes of detecting fraud. Further information about data confidentiality is available upon request from the Data Protection Officer (gdpr@bcot.ac.uk) or from the GDPR page.Privacy NoticeHow We Use Your Personal Information
The personal information you provide for enrolment is passed to the Chief Executive of Skills Funding ("the Agency") and, when needed, the Department for Education, including the Education Funding Agency to meet legal responsibilities under the Apprenticeships, Skills Children and Learning Act 2009, and for the Agency's Learning Records Service (LRS) to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN). The information you provide may be shared with other organisations for education, training and employment-related purposes, including for research.
Further information and our privacy notices can be found on our GDPR page.
