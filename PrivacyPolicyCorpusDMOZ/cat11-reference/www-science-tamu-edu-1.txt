Texas A&M College of Science Web Privacy and Security Policy
The following is the privacy and security policy for this site:
1. We do not use cookies to collect personal information that would identify you as an individual. (Note: A cookie file contains unique information a web site can use to track such things as passwords, lists of pages you’ve visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page or to identify your session at a particular web site.) We do use temporary or session cookies to help you navigate our site and to analyze website traffic patterns with the aim to improve the performance and usability.
2. If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that e-mails us this information, we will use the personally-identifiable information only to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.
3. For site management functions, information is collected and may be used for analysis and statistical purposes. We may use this information to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
We also may use this information for site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users by detecting unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Texas Penal Code Chapters 33 (Computer Crimes) or 33A (Telecommunications Crimes).
The following information is collected for this analysis:
User Client hostname – The hostname (or IP address if DNS is disabled) of the user/client requesting access.

HTTP header, “referrer” – The referrer specifies the page from which the client accessed the current page.
System date – The date and time of the user/client request. Full request – The exact request the user/client made.

5. Information Access
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives you the right to be informed about the information our web sites collect about you. It also gives you the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the university correct any of that information. You may request to receive and review any of this information, or request corrections to it, by contacting the appropriate public information officer. All form data and server logs are subject to this act.
