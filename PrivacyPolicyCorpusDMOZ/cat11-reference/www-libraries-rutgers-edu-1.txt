Privacy Policy
The Rutgers University Libraries
Privacy
Policy
explains
your
privacy
and
confidentiality
rights, the steps the Libraries take to respect and protect your privacy when
you
use
library
resources, and how we deal with personally identifiable information that
we
may
collect
from
you.
I. Introduction
Privacy is essential to the exercise of free speech, free thought,
and
free
association.
The
Rutgers University Libraries consider the right to privacy to
be
the
right
to
open
inquiry
without having the subject of one's interest examined or scrutinized by others.
Confidentiality
exists when a library is in possession of personally identifiable information
about
users
and
keeps that information private on their behalf.
The courts have upheld
the
right
to
privacy
based
on
the
Bill
of
Rights
of
the
U.S.
Constitution. The
Libraries
privacy
and
confidentiality
policies
are
in
compliance
with
applicable federal, state, and
local
laws,
as
well
as
Rutgers
University’s
institutional
policies related to privacy.
Library user rights outlined here are based in part on what are known in the
United
States
as
the five "Fair Information Practice Principles." These five principles
outline
the
rights
of
Notice, Choice, Access, Security, and Enforcement.
Our commitment to your privacy and confidentiality has deep roots not only in law
but
also
in
the ethics and practices of librarianship. In accordance with the American Library Association's
Code of Ethics:
"We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information
sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired, or transmitted."
II.
The
Rutgers
University
Libraries
Commitment
to
Our
Users’
Rights
of
Privacy
&
Confidentiality
The Rutgers University Libraries are committed to protecting user privacy when library resources
are used and personally identifiable information is collected.
1. Notice & Openness
The Rutgers University Libraries inform users
about
the
policies
governing
the
amount
and
retention of personally identifiable information and about why that information is necessary for
the provision of library services.
We post publicly the privacy and information-gathering policies of the Libraries on our
website
and other
places
as
appropriate.
Whenever
policies
change,
notice
of
those
changes
is
disseminated widely to our users.
The Rutgers University Libraries gather information about current and valid
library
users
for
the sole purpose of providing library services. Where it
is
necessary
for
the
Libraries
to
identify users, it is our goal to gather only the minimum information necessary
and
to
retain
that information for only as long as it is needed to complete a particular transaction. We avoid
creating unnecessary records and retaining records not needed for the fulfillment of the mission
of the Libraries. Furthermore, we do
not
engage
in
practices
that
might
place
personally
identifiable information in or on public view.
2. Choice & Consent
The Rutgers University Libraries keep all personally identifiable information
confidential.
We
will not share, sell, license, or disclose personal information to any third party without
your
consent unless we are compelled to do so under the law or to comply with a court order.
The Libraries receive personally identifiable information automatically from the Office
of
the
Registrar (for students) and the Office of Human Resources (for employees) or directly from
you
to create and update your library user account. User accounts contain an official email
address
and home and campus mailing addresses supplied
by
the
university.
You
have
the
option
of
providing a different email address for the purpose of
receiving
notifications
about
library
accounts.
When you borrow materials from the Rutgers University Libraries, we scan
the
barcode
on
your
photo identification card and then link your personally identifiable information
to
the
items
borrowed.
When using library services through our website, you may
need
to
provide
your
name,
e-mail
address, NetID, password, barcode, and/or password. To use licensed subscription electronic resources
from an off-campus location, users are required to submit a NetID and password or library barcode
and
password to be authenticated as a currently affiliated user.
When using certain library services or collections, you may need to show
identification
and/or
provide personally identifiable information on paper forms or logs that are retained as needed.
3. Access by Users
The Rutgers University Libraries provide you access
to
activities
on
your
library
account.
Before viewing your library account, you are asked to present a Rutgers NetID
and
password
or
library barcode and password for identification online or a photo ID in
person
to
ensure
verification
of
identity. You may access your personal information in person or by telephone.
Library users must update their personally
identifiable
information
to
ensure
that
library
operations can function properly. Rutgers University faculty, students, and staff can
view
and
update their personally identifiable information through the university online directory.
Users
not affiliated with the university can
update
their
information
at
any
Rutgers
University
library.
4. Data Integrity & Security
Data Integrity: The Rutgers University Libraries are committed
to
collecting
and
maintaining
accurate and secure data. We strive to assure data integrity, including:
using
only
reputable
sources of data, providing you access to
your
own
library
account,
updating
data
whenever
possible, utilizing middleware authentication
systems
that
authorize
use
without
requiring
personally identifiable information, destroying untimely data
or
converting
it
to
anonymous
form.
Data Retention: We protect personally identifiable
information
from
unauthorized
disclosure.
Once it is no longer needed to manage library services, we regularly purge, shred, or
anonymize
personally
identifiable
information
about
library
users,
library
resource
use,
material
circulation history, and security/surveillance tapes and logs.
Tracking Users: Our Libraries have invested in appropriate technology to protect the security of
any personally identifiable information while it is in the library's custody, and we ensure that
aggregate, summary data is stripped of
personally
identifiable
information.
We
do
not
ask
library visitors or website users to identify themselves
or
reveal
any
personal
information
unless they are borrowing materials; requesting
special
services;
registering
for
services,
programs, or classes; or making remote use from outside the library of
those
portions
of
the
Libraries website restricted to registered borrowers under license agreements or
other
special
arrangements. We discourage users from choosing
passwords that
could
reveal
their
identity, including social security numbers. We remove cookies, web history,
cached
files,
or
other computer and Internet use records and other software code that is
placed
on
our
public
computers or networks after each use.
We
remove
links
between
user
records
and
materials
borrowed when items are returned, and we
delete
records
as
soon
as
the
purpose
for
data
collection has been satisfied.
Third Party Security: The Rutgers University Libraries use
and
link
to
resources
owned
and
operated by third parties, including integrated
library
systems,
offsite
computer
services,
databases, and electronic journals. We license these resources for the use of Rutgers authorized
users. We make every attempt to include user privacy
protections
in
license
agreements
with
third parties, such as vendors of digital information resources like
electronic
databases
and
journals. Nevertheless, because the use of these websites and resources is not governed
by
the
Rutgers University Libraries, we strongly recommend that you review the privacy policies of
the
websites that you visit, particularly if you are requesting online help through email or chat or
establishing your own account for specialized services like
table
of
contents,
email,
saved
search alerts, purchases, or personalization features. When
connecting
to
licensed
resources
outside the library, we authenticate users as members of our community and do
not
provide
any
personally identifiable information.
Cookies: Our Libraries do not use cookies to verify information about our users.
However,
some
of our licensed resources require the temporary enabling of cookies. For searches
conducted
on
your computer, you can refuse to accept or disable cookies and remove them from your hard drive.
The Rutgers University Libraries erase cookies
from
library
computers
after
you
close
the
browser at the end of your session.
Security Measures: Our security measures involve both
managerial
and
technical
policies
and
procedures to protect against loss and the unauthorized access, destruction, use, or
disclosure
of the data. Our managerial measures
include
internal
organizational
procedures
that
limit
access to data and ensure that those individuals
with
access
do
not
utilize
the
data
for
unauthorized purposes. Our technical security measures to prevent
unauthorized
access
include
encryption in the transmission and storage of data, limits on access through use
of
passwords,
and storage of data on secure servers or computers.
Staff access to
personal
data:
We
permit
only
authorized
Libraries
staff
with
assigned
confidential passwords to access personal data stored in the Libraries computer system
for
the
purpose of performing library work. We will not disclose any personal data we collect
from
you
to any other party except where required by law. The Libraries
do
not
sell
or
lease
users'
personal information to companies, universities, or individuals.
5. Enforcement & Redress
Our Libraries will not share data on individuals with third parties unless required by
law.
We
conduct regular privacy audits in order to ensure that all library
programs
and
services
are
enforcing our privacy policy. Library users who have questions, concerns,
or
complaints
about
our handling of their privacy and confidentiality rights should file written comments
with
the
Vice President for Information Services and University Librarian. We will respond
in
a
timely
manner and may conduct a privacy investigation or review of policy and procedures.
All Libraries staff and volunteers refer law enforcement inquiries to Libraries
administrators.
We confer with the Rutgers University Office of the Senior Vice President
and
General
Counsel
before determining the proper response. We will not make library records available to any agency
of state, federal, or local
government
unless
a
subpoena,
warrant,
court
order
or
other
investigatory document is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that shows good cause
and
is in proper form.
