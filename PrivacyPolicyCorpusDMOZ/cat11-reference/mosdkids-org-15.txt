Wish List
The greatest return on an investment is to                                           give it a VOICE
The cost to educate one child is $50,000 per year. Because of your help, no child has ever been turned away for a family’s inability to pay. Your gifts make it possible for MOSD to offer the best in services for young, hearing-impaired children. Your support is vital to insuring that these children receive the necessary services at the most critical time for learning speech and language.
You can make an investment in the lives of the children we serve, helping to set them on a path that leads to a successful and independent life. Your contributions empower deaf children to listen, learn, and talk.
Because of YOU, I can SAY:
The value of hearing everything and having a voice is priceless
