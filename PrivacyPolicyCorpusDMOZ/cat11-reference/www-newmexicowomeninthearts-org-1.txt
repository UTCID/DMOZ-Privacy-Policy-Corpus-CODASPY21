All online transactions, including donations, are strictly permission-based: The Donor/Volunteer controls the use of his name, personal information, and donation or other transaction.Key aspects of our privacy policy include:We never sell, share, trade, or disclose any personal information about a Donor/Volunteer.When a Donor/Volunteer performs a transaction, we require the entry of only enough information about you to process your transaction.Our credit card processing company is not authorized to retain, share, store, or use your personal information.Internet User PrivacyWe respect the privacy of Internet Users and do not collect personally identifying information without the Internet User's permission.You may contact us regarding this Privacy Policy by e-mail, US mail, or phone.Some terms used in this Policy are:"Donor/Volunteer" - a person or organization that performs a transaction on our site."Cookies" - which are small pieces of information that are stored by an Internet User's browser on the Internet User's hard drive.Collection of DataWe do not collect Internet User identity or contact information from Internet Users' visits to our website. For each visitor to our website, the visitor's computer reaches us via a particular IP, (Internet Protocol), address. Our servers automatically collect this IP address.An Internet User's browser sets Cookies (when enabled) that contain small amounts of data on the Internet User's computer after a visit to any web site. Cookies assist us in tracking Internet Users' activities to facilitate easier navigation, data entry and retrieval, and preference tracking. By setting a cookie on our website, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our website.No information is obtained from the Internet User or Internet User's computer to generate the unique identifying number of the Internet User. Our servers automatically generate the unique number. None of our Cookies are used to perform "User Profiling".We do receive and record e-mail addresses of Internet Users, only in circumstances where the Internet User has voluntarily provided its identity and contact information through our website.Disabled and Non-functioning CookiesWe do not employ any technology or means of preventing an Internet User from disabling the acceptance of a Cookie. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but an Internet User's browser may be set by the Internet User to disable this function. Some Web browsers or similar Internet navigating technology may not support (or consistently support) Cookie technology. If Cookies are disabled or the Internet User is utilizing technology that does not adequately support Cookie technology, we shall not be able to record the Internet User's activity.Log FilesLike most standard websites we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.Use and Disclosure of DataWe do not sell or rent personally identifying information. We do not disclose personally identifying information to anyone that we are not authorized to do so. We use anonymous user data to create and report the browsing and/or form completion activities of anonymous users.When a Donor/Volunteer performs a transaction that requires him to be identified to a us (e.g., donation, volunteering, event registration, membership dues, etc.), and if the transaction involves a cash payment, our credit card processor are the only parties granted access to that Donor/Volunteer’s personal information.We will send an e-mail receipt for all cash transactions made by a Donor/Volunteer.

Access to user data is accessible via password protection through the Donor/Volunteer account created by each Donor/Volunteer, and to our designated employees who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. Access to Internet User data that identifies the Internet User's name and/or e-mail addresses is limited to designated employees who require such access in order to perform their jobs and to a Donor/Volunteer or Nonprofit that provided such information. Each Donor/Volunteer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their own password used for accessing their account on our website.We and our online credit card processors use TDES - Triple Data Encryption Standard. This is considered a "very strong" encryption method, and uses 168-bit security. It is one of the most secure methods available for online credit card processing. It is also used by Federal Government organizations to protect sensitive data. For more information, please see the Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 46-3, Data Encryption Standard (DES).We back up all of our data every day. Multiple copies of the data are maintained and stored in secure locations and are tested on backup equipment. In addition our systems are housed in a secure hosting environment with redundant connections to the Internet and redundant hardware. All of this simply means that you are protected against any computer failure or catastrophic data loss.Donor/Volunteer PrivacyWe do not share personally identifiable information about a Donor/Volunteer with anyone.
