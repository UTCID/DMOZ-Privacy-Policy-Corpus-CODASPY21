Cookie Policy
What are cookies?
A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a web site, and that web site can then retrieve the contents of that cookie. Most web sites use cookies to remember information about you and your preferences, either for the duration of your visit or for repeat visits.
If we didn’t use cookies, our web site would think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, if you were to enter your login details and then move to another page, our site wouldn’t be able to remember that you’d previously signed in.
Cookies may be set by the web site you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or by other web sites which provide content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).
About this cookies policy
This policy is valid for the Warwick Arts Centre website – www.warwickartscentre.co.uk
Cookies used on these sites can be categorised into three levels: strictly necessary; performance; functionality (first and third party).

Warwick Arts Centre’s online ticketing system SRO4 and Capita (card payment authorisation service) use temporary session cookies enabling customers to pass through the correct payment pathway.

Preference cookies enable a web site to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language.

Performance/Statistics Cookies
These cookies allow us to track the performance and usage of the Warwick Arts Centre’s web site with anonymised “statistics”. We use cookies to track your route around the web site and use the statistics that these create to improve the web site’s performance and user experience. These statistics allow us to continue to provide the website and events programme.
We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimise this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behaviour and their devices (in particular device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy policy.

These cookies are used by Google Analytics software to distinguish users. The information we gather includes but is not limited to how users interact with the Warwick Arts Centre’s web site, which pages are most frequently viewed, how frequently the users visit the web site, traffic source of user visit, demographics data (age and gender), location and device information (make and model). Any data collected is anonymous and used for statistical reporting only.
Other cookies created by Google Analytics include _gid, AMP_TOKEN and _gac (property-id). These cookies store other randomly generated ids and campaign information about the user.

Warwick Arts Centre occasionally uses a cookie linked to Qualtrics who provide a survey we use to help understand visitor behaviour. This in turn helps us to make improvements to the website.
Marketing/Advertising Cookies
These cookies are set by third parties such as YouTube or Twitter. They track your behaviour such as playing videos or which tweets you have already viewed. These cookies may be used by the cookie provider to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.
We sometimes embed photos and video content from third party web sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Flickr. As a result, when you visit one of our pages containing such content, you may be presented with cookies from these web sites. The sharing bar Add This is used to wrap the Tweet and Like buttons for sharing on Twitter and Facebook. The Twitter and Facebook buttons also use cookies which are activated when those buttons are clicked.
Our Facebook Connect plugin activates if the user is already logged into Facebook, and it sets cookies to identify the user’s Facebook session and interaction with Warwick Arts Centre’s website.
We don’t control the dissemination of these third party cookies and you should check the relevant third party’s web site for more information.
We don’t sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we disclose the information to third parties, except where required by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).
We sometimes use Google Ads Remarketing pixels to assist with our marketing and delivery of online advertising across the Internet, in particular on the Google Display Network. By better understanding what our audiences are interested in, we can more efficiently promote Warwick Arts Centre’s events. The technology to do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a “remarketing cookie” during your visit.
Google Ads remarketing will display ads to you based on what parts of Warwick Arts Centre’s website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your web browser. This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer or mobile device. The cookie is used to indicate to other websites that “This person visited a particular page, so show them ads relating to that page.” This way we can show you ads that are personalised to you.
If you do not wish to see personalised ads from Warwick Arts Centre you can opt out in several ways:
Opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings
Opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting youradchoices opt-out.
Please note that opting out won’t stop you seeing adverts, just that they won’t be tailored specifically to you.
