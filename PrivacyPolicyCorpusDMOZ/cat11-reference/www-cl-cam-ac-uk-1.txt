Privacy policy for the Computer Laboratory web server
As is the case with most web sites, our web servers
www.cl.cam.ac.uk and www.cst.cam.ac.uk
produce log files that record, for each HTTP request, the IP address
from where our servers believe the request came from (which is often
the address of an intermediate proxy server), the date and time, the
HTTP request itself (command and URL), our server's result code, and
the number of bytes transmitted. If a user has logged into one of our
web services, we may also record that user's identity. Such logins may
be verified via the University of
Cambridge Raven authentication
service. We may enable the recording of additional data from time to
time as the need arises.
All data is available to the server's administrators and will be
used primarily to monitor the server's performance, to optimize the
content of our web site, and to detect malfunctions or malicious
behaviour. Log files may also be made available to other members of
the department or the University Information Services (UIS), for
similar purposes and for use in research projects. We may keep our log
files indefinitely. Our detailed log files are not normally available
to anyone outside our department or the UIS, unless we are required to
transfer such data by UK law. We may publish summary statistics
generated from our web-server logs, which do not contain information
related to individual users.
Our sites may store HTTP cookies in your web browser as part of
user authentication (login) and to store information needed by other
facilities.
Our sites may store HTTP cookies in your web browser as used by
Google Analytics.
As is the case with most web sites, individual pages on our sites
may contain links to images on other web sites. If your web browser is
configured to fetch images automatically, similar data may be recorded
by these other web servers as well, as the images are being loaded.
Individual pages on our web sites may contain forms for interacting
with databases and other interactive services. Any data entered into
such forms may be recorded by the respective server and, where
personal data is collected, we ask the operator of such a service to
provide a link to a privacy policy for this service.
The Department regularly uses names, research profiles and
photographs of present and past students, staff, visitors and
collaborators on publicly accessible webpages available on our
websites www.cl.cam.ac.uk
and www.cst.cam.ac.uk. If you do not wish for some or all
of your details to be included, please contact the Department using
the following email address:
[Javascript required], naming
the members of staff with whom you have worked.
