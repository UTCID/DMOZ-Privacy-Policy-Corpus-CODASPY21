Roadside GeorgiaPrivacy Policy
This privacy policy discloses all information gathering techniques and policies on use of said information currently used by Roadside Georgia.
This web site is created and managed by Golden Ink, Inc., a Georgia Corporation.
Golden Ink solicits e-mail addresses for the purposes of further communication with a party.
Any e-mail address sent to Golden Ink is deemed confidential and will not be shared with any individual, organization, or corporation other than Golden Ink.
Golden Ink maintains a number of mailing lists through a third-party vendor, Topica.com, which is owned by Topica, Inc. and to which Golden Ink has access.
The addresses maintained in this database are also deemed confidential by Golden Ink and Topica, Inc and will not be released by Golden Ink or Topica, Inc, or any employee of either corporation.
We will not contact any person who submits any e-mail address for any purpose other than the original intended communication.
Email addresses will not be added to any future mailing lists, sold, or in any way disclosed to a third-party.
Golden Ink also collects addresses for additional information by mail.
These addresses are used expressly for the purposes collected.
Because of the diversity of some of the locations involved mail may come from more than one location, however, addresses collected through this means are never divulged to any third-party.
