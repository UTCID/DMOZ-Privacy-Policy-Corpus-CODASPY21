User data: When users decide to register in iAgora, or in the international careers platforms managed by iAgora, the necessary data will be requested to allow them to find the best job offers and apply to them.

Recruiter Data: For the human resources services that iAgora offers companies and organizations, iAgora collects and processes the personal data of the people who will manage job offers in order to identify them and communicate with them.

For technical reasons, some personal data may continue to exist for an indefinite period of time on the iAgora servers after they have been deleted from the system (eg backup copies). iAgora makes sure that these data are not processed in any way.
The personal data of users who have been invited to an International Careers platform by their training center but who did not complete their registration will be automatically erased after a few months.
