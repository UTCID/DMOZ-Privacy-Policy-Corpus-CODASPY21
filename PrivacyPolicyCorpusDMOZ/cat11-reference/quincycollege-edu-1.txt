Annual Security Reports
Pursuant to the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery Act”), the Quincy College, Quincy and Plymouth campuses, are required to annually compile and publish an Annual Security Report. This report contains definitions of reportable Clery Act offenses, required policy statements pertaining to campus security and safety, and statistics for reportable Clery Act crimes for the past four calendar years.
Quincy College does not own or control any student housing, and is therefore exempt from keeping a fire log or submitting a fire safety report. Quincy College is also exempt from having a policy in place for campus notification of missing persons, which is only required for those institutions that provide campus housing.

Appropriate Virtual Learning Technology Use and Privacy Requirements
In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, one step Quincy College has taken is to shift to providing virtual learning opportunities for its students. Aspart of our virtual learning plan, Quincy College has and will, where appropriate, continue to engage educational opportunities using various College authorized providers to deliver a synchronous video conferencing platform. This platform has the capability to capture video and sound within range of a student’s computer camera and/or microphone. Prior to engaging in this form of virtual learning, Quincy College would like to clarify expectations for use of virtual technology for educational purposes as outlined in the Appropriate Virtual Learning Technology Use and Privacy Requirements.
