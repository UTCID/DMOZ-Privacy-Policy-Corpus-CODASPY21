Pronouns
Beginning September 13, 2019, students will be able to indicate their pronouns in the Gaucho On-Line Data (GOLD) system, which will then be displayed in various campus systems. Pronouns are words used in place of someone’s name when a person is referred to in the third person. This new functionality will result in pronouns showing up on course rosters so students are being referred to by the correct pronouns. For more information about pronouns and their use, please visit the Pronouns 101 page provided by UCSB's Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity. Providing Pronoun informationStudents can specify their pronouns by going into GOLD and visiting the 'My Personal Info' page (under the 'About Me' menu).
Students will be able to choose one of the following options from the drop down list:He/Him/HisShe/Her/HersThey/Them/TheirsZe/Hir/HirsI do not use a pronounOther; please askI use all gender pronouns Impacted SystemsFor the initial rollout, the project scope has been limited to the systems most commonly used by instructors to view their course rosters.  The list of systems will expand over time and we hope to make it so that employees and other campus affiliates may provide pronouns in the future.System NamePurposeDisplay LocationOther informationGauchoSpaceGauchoSpace is the primary campus Learning Management SystemCourse Rosters, Discussion ForumsThe user profile in GauchoSpace has additional settings to better control display behavior throughout the system. Goes live on September 20, 2019.Updates made in GOLD may take up to 24 hours to update GauchoSpace.eGradeseGrades is the system used by instructors to view current course enrollment and assign student grades.Course Roster and Class List DownloadGOLDGOLD is the front end application students use to access and interact with information in the campus Student Information SystemMy Personal InfoThis system is currently used by students to provide their personal pronouns.  This functionality may shift to the campus Directory Editor at a future date.
