RVCC Identity Verification Statement
HomePolicies & Consumer Information RVCC Identity Verification Statement
AccreditationRaritan Valley Community College (RVCC) is fully accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) with authorization to offer courses and programs via Distance Education.
Middle States Commission on Higher Education
3624 Market Street, 2nd Floor West, Philadelphia, PA 19104See our Statement of Accreditation Status.Legal Basis for Identity VerificationBased on the United States Federal Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), Public Law 110-315 the MSCHE requires our accreditation agencies to confirm that RVCC has processes in place through which we establish that the student who registers in a distance education or correspondence education course or program is the same student who participates in and completes the course or program and receives the academic credit.The RVCC Office of Instructional Technology meets this requirement as per the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 34 Section 602.17 Paragraph (g) in that we:Verify the identity of a student who participates in class or coursework by using at least one of the following options in all Distance Education courses or programsA secure login and pass code;Proctored examinations; andNew or other technologies and practices that are effective in verifying student identification; and
Make clear in writing that we use processes that protect student privacy and notify students of any projected additional student charges associated with the verification of student identity at the time of registration or enrollment.  This information is available on in the Student Handbook.How Identity is VerifiedVerifying the identity of students in our courses and programs is a significant, multifaceted, and ongoing process.  Identity verification begins when a student applies for admission to the institution and continues through their graduation, transfer or withdrawal from study.Procedures related to student identity verification include but are not limited to: our registration, advising and transcript procedures, and the login and security functions of "WebStudy" - our course Learning Management System (LMS) - wherein we create a unique username and password for each individual student.  This unique set of login credentials consists of data which the student is likely to know, and which others are unlikely to know.  The student is required to use these credentials to access our LMS. We encourage our students to reset their confidential password.  Data transmission of login information is secured using standard encryption technology.Privacy of Personally Identifiable InformationPersonally identifiable information collected by the college may be used, at the discretion of the institution, as the basis for identity verification.  For instance, students requesting that their WebStudy password be reset may be asked to provide two or more pieces of information for comparison with data in our records, such as their RVCC Student ID number and course identification, or other similar information, as determined by college staff members in the performance of their duties.  However, with the exception of established "Directory Information" no such data will be disclosed without the consent of the student.  User ResponsibilityUsers with access to the LMS (WebStudy) are responsible for maintaining the security of usernames, passwords and any other access credentials assigned to them.  Access credentials may not be shared or given to anyone other than the user to whom they were assigned for any reason.  Users are responsible for any and all use of their account.  RVCC recommends that all users change their password when necessary to maintain security.  Users are held responsible for knowledge of the information contained within the most recent RVCC catalog as well as the RVCC Student Handbook.  Failure to read and comply with college guidelines, requirements and regulations will not exempt users from responsibility.  It is particularly important that you follow the standards of academic honesty and integrity as outlined in the located on in the Student Handbook, as well as the Computer and Network Use Policies.Costs to StudentsCourse fees for Online and Hybrid course sections are listed on our Tuition and Fees page.Academic IntegrityThe RVCC Code of Conduct, also located in the Student Handbook, applies fully to college activities and courses held online, as well as those held on and off campus.  Students are expected to abide by the standards established for academic integrity in all course sections at the college.  However, technology and personal accountability alone are unable to fully verify identity or ensure academic integrity.  Instructional design, which replaces high-stakes objective testing with individualized and authentic assessment techniques, is utilized wherever possible.  RVCC best practices for course design use varied instructional methods and employ several built-in features of the LMS to reduce academic dishonesty.Public NoticeThis document is publicly available online to all students and potential students.QuestionsQuestions regarding this document should be directed to techservices techservices@raritanval.edu.
