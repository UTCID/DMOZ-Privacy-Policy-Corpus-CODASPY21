Data for Statements of Account
Since CEEOL is obliged to provide for the copyright-holders statistical data regarding content usage and accounting data regarding downloads of payable content, all information needed for these reports and statements is automatically collected. The reports of CEEOL, however, do never provide any individual or personal, but only statistical data to third parties.
CEEOL provides COUNTER-enabled statistics to institutional customers. These statistics give some indication on downloads per IP address within the IP range of the institution. In the exceptional case that one IP address is linked to only one user, this may allow the reader of the statistics to draw a conclusion about this person.
Data Security
We have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect online. We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from www.ceeol.com. In the event that we discover or are notified of a security breach where personal information is at risk, we will notify you electronically if we have your email address. If you do not wish to be notified via email in the event of a breach, please contact us at info@ceeol.com.

CEEOL may disclose personal information
if required to do so by law;
if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding;
