Unless expressly permitted, you may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, enter into a database, display, perform, modify, create derivative works from, transmit or in any way exploit any part of our site or any content thereon, except as permitted under the last sentence of this Section and except that you may make one print copy that is limited to occasional articles of personal interest only.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (but subject to the last sentence of this Section), you may not distribute any part of this site or any content thereon over any network, including, without limitation, a local area  network, or sell or offer it for sale.  In addition, these files may not be used to construct any kind of database.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, The TRIZ Journal respects the right of others to make “fair use” of the materials contained on The TRIZ Journal Website, and as a result, you may from time to time excerpt and use materials set forth on this site consistent with the principles of “fair use”.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice.
The TRIZ Journal respects the intellectual property of others, and, particularly as to user generated content in comments, discussion boards or in other user contributed content, as applicable, The TRIZ Journal asks our users to do the same.  If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide The TRIZ Journal the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest; (b) description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed; (c) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site; (d) your address, telephone number and email address; (e) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.
Indemnification.
Except as prohibited by law, you will indemnify and hold harmless The TRIZ Journal from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, whether in an action of contract, negligence or other tortious action, or arising out of or in connection with these terms and conditions, including without limitation any claim arising from (i) your use of and access to The TRIZ Journal Website; (ii) your violation of any of these terms and conditions; (iii) any breach by you of your representations and warranties hereunder; (iv) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (v) any claim that your content caused damage to a third party.  This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these terms and conditions and your use of The TRIZ Journal Website.
