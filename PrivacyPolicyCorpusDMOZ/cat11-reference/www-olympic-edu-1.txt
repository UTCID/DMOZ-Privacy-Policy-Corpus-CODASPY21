Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act
Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act
Notification Regarding the Release of Student Directory Information
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
Under FERPA, education records are described as those records, files documents, and other materials which:
Contain information directly related to a student; and
Are maintained by an educational institution
Under certain circumstances the College may release student educational records, which includes:
School officials with legitimate educational interest;
Other schools to which a student is transferring;
Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
Accrediting organizations;
To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;
Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.
FERPA also allows the College to release student Directory Information without consent of the students. Olympic College defines Director Information as:
Name
Dates of attendance
Degrees received
Major program
Height and weight of athletes.
Students may opt out of the release of Directory Information by contacting Records & Registration and completing a form.
Take the FERPA tutorial.
Learn more about Students Rights under FERPA.
