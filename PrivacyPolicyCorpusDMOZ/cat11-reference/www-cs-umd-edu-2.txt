This is Dr. Katz's Distinguished Scholar-Teacher talk. It targets a general audience while aiming to also be interesting to experts. The Distinguished Scholar-Teacher Program, established in 1978, honors a small number of faculty members each year who have demonstrated notable success in both scholarship and teaching. By honoring the Distinguished Scholar-Teachers with this prestigious award, we reaffirm our commitment to excellence in teaching and scholarship. The Distinguished Scholar-Teacher Program is sponsored by the Office of Academic Affairs and administered by the Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs.
