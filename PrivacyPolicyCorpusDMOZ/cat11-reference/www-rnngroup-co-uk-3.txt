Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking
Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking
The RNN Group is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking within its supply chains or in any part of its services through due diligence wherever possible.
Further details of the Group’s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement can be found here: Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
British Values
British Values
RNN Group Colleges (Rotherham College, North Notts College and Dearne Valley College) and providers recognise British Values as core principles which support our learners and staff to be active and successful citizens in their local communities.
The Department of Education define British Values as:
Democracy
The rule of Law
Individual liberty
Mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs
In actively promoting these values, all learners and staff are encouraged and supported to develop their knowledge, understanding and practice of these principles. This is achieved through clear and enforced policies, innovative programmes of teaching and learning and visual media campaigns.
As part of our statutory duty to safeguard learners, the Prevent agenda is regularly reviewed against our policies and action plans to ensure a safe learning environment is provided to our learners. A variety of teaching, learning and pastoral delivery raises staff and learners’ awareness of their responsibility to “prevent people from being drawn into terrorism” (Counter Terrorism and Security Act, 2015)
See below the outline and frameworks which support the RNN Group approach to embedding and promoting British Values and the Prevent agenda.

Counter Terrorism and Prevent
Counter Terrorism and Prevent
Users of the RNN Group’s systems should be aware that the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act (2015) makes it an offence for an individual to collect or make a record of information of a kind that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, or to possess a document or record containing information of that kind (e.g. a terrorist training manual).
The Counter-terrorism and Security Act (2015) also makes it an offence to disseminate terrorist publications in order to encourage others to engage in terrorism.
The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act (2015) requires the RNN Group “to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism.”
Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015
The RNN Group has an established ethics approval processes and secure storage systems for staff and students who require access to and potentially store sensitive or extremism/terrorism-related materials as part of their bona fide studies or research. All users considering accessing and storing such materials are very strongly advised to first obtain ethics approval from the appropriate staff members and to make use of the secure storage facility for such materials.
Section 26 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 places a duty on all FE and training providers, as listed in Schedule 3 of the Act, to have “due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism”.
The Prevent duty is also part of the Safeguarding duty for providers but one that extends to all learners of all age groups and also staff.
The government has defined extremism in the Prevent strategy as: “vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.” This also includes calls for the death of members of the British armed forces.
British values are defined as “democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance for those with different faiths and beliefs”; institutions are expected to encourage students to respect other people with particular regard to the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010.

Investigatory Powers
Investigatory Powers
As required by UK legislation, the RNN Group draws to the attention of all users of the Group’s data and telephone networks the fact that their communications may be intercepted as permitted by the Investigatory Powers Act (formally the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000).
Investigatory Powers Act 2016
The legislation allows the RNN Group to intercept without consent for purposes such as recording evidence of transactions, ensuring regulatory compliance, detecting crime or unauthorised use, and ensuring the operation of their telecommunications systems. The Group does not need to gain consent before intercepting for these purposes, although we need to inform staff and students that interceptions may take place.
In the course of their normal duties, some staff have the authority and are indeed required to carry out, certain monitoring activities in order to ensure the correct operation of telecommunications systems. This does not imply that all communications are monitored, just that they MAY be for the above purposes.
Safeguarding
Safeguarding
RNN Group places the safety and wellbeing of students and staff at the forefront of all its operations and acknowledges the range of activities that contribute to creating and maintaining an environment that promotes effective safeguarding practice.
The Safeguarding for All Policy provides for a coherent framework of practice to be in place and for all policies relating to this framework to address this priority. The Safeguarding for All Policy is reviewed each year and when/or changes in law, policy, guidance or best practice occur in order to ensure that it remains a key driver in the development of strategy on safeguarding.
RNN Group recognise its duties, statutory and otherwise to ensure that the Colleges function with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children receiving education and training at all Group sites.
The Policy applies to all as Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility.
Key RNN policies that contribute to the overarching Safeguarding for All Policy are available on request. Each policy addresses College strategy and operations relating to key college activities and safeguarding provision is made within all activities.
