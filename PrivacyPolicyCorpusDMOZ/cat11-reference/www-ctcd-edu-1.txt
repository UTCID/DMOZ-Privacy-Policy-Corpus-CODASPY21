Web Privacy Policy

Web Privacy Policy
Required Link
Each web application or site must contain a link for "Web Privacy" that links to this policy.
Purpose
The Central Texas College District (CTCD) is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of confidential information. CTC does not actively share personal information gathered from its web servers. However, because CTC is a public institution, some information (including the summary server log information, emails sent to websites, and information collected from web-based forms) may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act, which grants the sharing of information with law enforcement agencies in some cases.
As part of its commitment to maintain the privacy of its web users, CTC has developed this privacy statement. The statement has two following purposes:
To educate users about privacy issues
To inform users about specific privacy policies and guidelines employed at Central Texas College
CTC also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education/student records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to CTC students, the College is equally committed to protecting the privacy of all CTC website visitors.
Scope
Central Texas College (by and through its academic, research, and administrative units and programs) owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (CTCD Web). This Web Privacy Policy applies to all domains within the CTCD Web.
Exceptions
The Central Texas College website contains links to many external websites. Central Texas College cannot be held liable for any damages or loss of personal information once a user has left the CTC domain.
Information Gathered by Central Texas College
CTCD Web servers generate temporary logs that may contain the following information:
Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
Webpages requested
Referring webpage
Browser used
Date and time
UIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)
The data is used in aggregate by CTC employees to improve website content and user interface and is not ordinarily associated with specific individuals.
Raw data from these logs is only shared with the custodian of each website. Summary reports produced from the logs help web publishers determine what browsers and pages are most popular.
Information collected via an email or form to CTC may be redirected to the appropriate department(s). This information will not be used or distributed to any parties outside of CTC unless legally required.
Third-Party Content
Some pages within ctcd.edu or ctcfacstaff.ctcd.edu domains may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a ctcd.edu website might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party.
The following code would represent an example of third party content:
<img src="/%3Ca%20href%3D"http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif">http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" />
In the above example, logo.gif would be third party content served from a web server outside the ctcd.edu domain (other-org.com). Third party content through ctcd.edu is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.
CTC does not transmit any information to these third parties. However, when you visit ctcd.edu pages that contain third party content, information such as your IP address, date, browser, and requested page are transmitted from your computer to that third party. CTC is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external third parties.
Third-Party Hosted Sites
The College uses several secure sites to collect information on behalf of CTC. These sites maintain their own privacy policies to protect personal information. Information collected by these hosted sites is only shared with relevant departments within Central Texas College.
(Please note that some of these hosted sites will require the use of cookies in order for users to login.)
Cookies
Definition: An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser, that may store it and send it back together with the next request to the same server. Typically, it's used to know if two requests came from the same browser allowing to keep a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
Cookie/Tracking Technology. The Site may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site, and understanding how visitors use the Site. Cookies can also help customize the Site for visitors. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.
We use cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of the website, and their access preferences. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. We use temporary “session” cookies to maintain the information we need to have for you to browse from page to page. Session cookies are temporary and disappear after you close your browser. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information. You can prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether by accessing your browser’s preferences menu.
Google Analytics
Central Texas College utilizes the reporting and assessment capabilities of Google Analytics to continuously improve user experience. Google Analytics is a tracking, analyzing, and data reporting site that collects and stores information on their protected servers. Individuals may opt-out at the browser level by visiting Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On.
To learn more about Google's privacy policy, visit the Google Privacy & Terms webpage.
Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information
CTC does its best to ensure that personal information is kept accurate. Users can check and update personal information (e.g., home address, email address, or phone number) via WebAdvisor.
While no computer system is 100% secure, CTC has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under CTC’s control. These security measures and CTC’s systems are audited by certified, independent security specialists.
E-commerce
Several sites within the CTC domain let you to pay for products or services online with a credit card. These transactions are encrypted unless otherwise noted. Likewise, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site, it is College policy that confidential information entered via a transaction is used only for the purposes described in that transaction.
Sharing of Information
CTC shares information with other parties and gathers information from other private data providers. (For example, the college receives test scores from testing agencies and sends transcripts to other schools.) This is done only at the request of the user (the person to whom the information applies). Unless specifically required by a public information request filed under the Texas Public Information Act, it is against College policy to release confidential information gathered through the web (e.g., pages visited or personalized preferences).
In accordance with FERPA, CTC does not release personal student information (other than public directory information) to other parties unless we receive explicit written authorization to do so. (Examples of directory information include first and last name, address, and date of birth.) Enrolled students can restrict the release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.
Public Forums
CTC has made public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. While CTC does not ordinarily log public chat sessions, any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Users should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such places.
Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Blackboard, may be logged. However, these educational records are protected from disclosure by FERPA.
Open Records Requests
Except for educational records governed by FERPA, all information collected from the CTC website (including the summary server log information), emails sent to the website, and web-based forms may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.
Texas Public Information Act
The Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives you the right to view the information that CTC collects about you. It also gives you the right to request a copy of that information and to have the College correct any information that is wrong. You may request this information or corrections to it by contacting the Records Office in Killeen, Texas.
Questions
If you have questions about this privacy statement or you believe that your personal information has been released without your consent, please send email to help.desk@ctcd.edu.
