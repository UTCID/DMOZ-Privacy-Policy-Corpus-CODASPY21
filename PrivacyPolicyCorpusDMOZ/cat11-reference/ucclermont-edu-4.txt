Paralegal Studies
Now more than ever, lawyers are looking to provide affordable, effective legal services for clients —and paralegals are the solution.
As employers —including law firms, corporate legal departments, insurance companies and banks — reduce costs, paralegals perform an ever-expanding variety of indispensable tasks in intellectual property, healthcare and elder issues, and in criminal, environmental and international law.
For those looking to pursue this exciting career path, the University of Cincinnati Clermont College offers its premier Paralegal Studies program, approved by the American Bar Association (ABA). For over 18 years, the college's dynamic program has featured courses taught by experienced attorneys offering practical, hands-on legal training that prepares students for real-world success. Our graduates can be found working in small, medium and large law firms in the greater Cincinnati area; at state and federal government agencies; and in legal roles in a growing number of private companies.
Whether you're a recent college graduate seeking to expand your marketable skills, a professional looking to change careers, returning to the workforce or considering law school, UC Clermont offers affordable, flexible options for you. Explore our post-baccalaureate certificate, post-associate certificate or associate degree programs that will equip you with the tools to enter the legal workforce.
