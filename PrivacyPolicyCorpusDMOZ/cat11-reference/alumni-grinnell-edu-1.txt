The Personal Data collected by us, or on our behalf, is collected: (i) to provide requested products and services; (ii) to respond to your inquiries and provide customer support; (iii) for our internal marketing purposes, which include, but are not limited to, sending you material about products, services, updates, etc., that we think may be of interest to you; (iv) to analyze how sites and services are being accessed and used; (v) for investigation of information security and information asset protection-related incidents; (vi) to test, correct, and improve our content, applications, and services; (vii) to develop new applications, products, and services; (viii) to improve site and service performance and delivery; and (ix) for other purposes as described under “Other Uses of Personal Data” below.

Where we have determined that the legal basis for processing your Personal Data is that it is necessary to serve our legitimate interests, we have concluded that our interests do not inappropriately impact your fundamental rights and freedoms with respect to your Personal Data.

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out herein unless a longer period is required under applicable law, or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights, or otherwise to comply with our legal obligations.  Where we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent, we will retain your Personal Data for the period of time necessary to carry out the processing activities to which you consented, subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased.

Where we are processing your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests, we will retain your Personal Data for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest in question, taking into account your fundamental rights and freedoms with respect to your Personal Data.
Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data will be stored on Grinnell’s servers, which are in the United States, and on the servers of cloud-based services Grinnell engages. If you are outside of the United States, you should understand that we may transfer your Personal Data to the United States.  Because the United States has not sought or received an adequacy decision under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we rely on appropriate safeguards and on derogations for specific situations that are recognized under GDPR when transferring your Personal Data to the United States.
Your Rights with Respect to Your Personal Data
To the extent required by and in accordance with applicable law, upon your request, we will provide you with information about the Personal Data of yours that we possess.  In addition to obtaining that information from us, you may have a right to: (i) correct any of your Personal Data that is inaccurate; (ii) restrict or limit the ways in which we use or process your Personal Data; (iii) request that we delete your Personal Data; and (iv) obtain a copy of your Personal Data in an easily accessible format. You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data where our processing is solely based on your consent, subject to certain limitations at law; provided, however, that in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn your consent and requested that we delete your Personal Data, if we have a legal basis to do so.  For example, we may retain Personal Data that is needed to comply with our legal obligations, if we still need the Personal Data for the lawful purposes for which we obtained it, or if it is necessary to retain the Personal Data to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping our services and operations safe and secure.
Questions/Concerns/Complaints
If you have questions, concerns, or complaints about how we are using your Personal Data, or wish to make any requests regarding your Personal Data, we ask that you contact our Data Protection Officer using the information listed below.
