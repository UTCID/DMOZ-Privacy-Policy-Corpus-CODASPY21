We are deeply committed to the health and safety of our patrons and employees. Throughout December and January, the library will be open to faculty, staff, and students in approved categories on select dates in accordance with state social distancing guidelines. Please see December 2020 and January 2021 Libraries Access for more information on access policies for different periods and Hours & Directions for day-by-day information on hours of operation.
Seating will be reduced to accommodate social distancing protocols and library visitors will be limited to quiet, independent study. All campus Libraries will also continue to serve the UVM community with robust online access to collections and services.
A valid CATcard ID is required to enter the library. Capacity is limited to 225 visitors at a time. People will be asked to return at another time or wait in line if the library is at capacity.
