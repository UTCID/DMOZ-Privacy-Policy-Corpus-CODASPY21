Privacy Breach Protocol
On June 10, 2006, the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) were extended to all Ontario universities.  King’s, in connection, with Western’s Freedom of Information and Privacy (FOIP) Committee has prepared for this new requirement.   King’s complied with all of the regulations required.   Since its inception in 1954,  King’s has demonstrated its commitment to the principles of privacy protection (demonstrated by the college policies which are linked from this page) and prides itself on its open, collegial governance.
King’s had benefited from its participation in Western’s Freedom of Information and Privacy (FOIP) Committee and wishes to thank this group for its expertise and support.  The FAQ links and resources on this page are courtesy of the Western University Secretariat. Its Information and Privacy pages provides extensive information and expertise.
