THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED
1) Website(s):
The following applies to all information collected or submitted on KMI’s operated website(s). On some pages, you can order products, make requests, submit information, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include; name, address, email address, phone number, credit/debit card information, as well as other similar personal information.
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you register a student sub-user, you may need to submit the student’s email and/or mailing address. In these circumstances, the types of personal information collected may be:
name, address, phone number, and/or email address. While student first name, last name combinations are readily available to the public, we nevertheless provide a method for preventing students from entering more than a single initial for last name. If you would like this feature turned on for your district, contact support@knowledgematters.com. Email addresses often follow a standard format and are readily guessable by the public. However, for schools that don’t want to expose student emails, we offer an option to use unique, computer generated usernames instead of email addresses. For more info on using this option, click here.
We also collect and store the results of each sub-users progress through the course materials which will be available to the holder of the license of the services for purposes of assessment. We do not store any official grades. We store only assignment-level grade recommendations for student simulation and quiz work.

Knowledge Matters does NOT authorize any district to use KMI systems as a repository for official district assignment, midterm, final or transcript-level grades at any time. To lessen the total amount of student assignment work and grade recommendations on our systems, beginning July 2018, we will permanently delete any student work and grade recommendation data for courses ending more than 12 months prior. Instructors should export any data needed prior to that time. For information on how to do this, click here.
