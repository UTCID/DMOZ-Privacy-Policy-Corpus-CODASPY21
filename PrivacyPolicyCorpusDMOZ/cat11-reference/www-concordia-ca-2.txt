Email privacy
Concordia collects your personal information mainly to stay in touch with you. Email communications in particular are aimed at keeping you informed about Concordia news, events, surveys and appeals.
Alumni may send a request to alumni@concordia.ca to be removed from mailing lists. Since some communications programs may already be in progress at the time a request is received, alumni may continue to receive communications for a short time before the change is being implemented.
Concordia students, faculty and staff cannot unsubscribe from the NOW newsletter or emails sent by the university.
