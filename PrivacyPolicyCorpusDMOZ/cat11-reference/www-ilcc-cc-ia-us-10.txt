Privacy of Records
Iowa Lakes Community College complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  of 1974 which affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. They are:
The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the college receives a request for access. A student should submit to the director of records and registration/ registrar or other appropriate official a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the registrar, the registrar shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. A student may ask the college to amend a record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. The student should write to the college official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. (Note: FERPA was not intended to provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments which are correctly recorded. The rights of challenge are not intended to allow a student to contest, for example, a grade in a course because the student felt a higher grade should have been assigned.) If the college decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the college will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to college officials with 45 legitimate educational interests. A college official is a person employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff, if any); a person or company with whom the college has contacted (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agent); a person serving on the college board of trustees or a student serving on an official committee, such as a discipline or grievance committee, or assisting another college official in performing his or her tasks. A college official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the college discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures of Iowa Lakes Community College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202.
