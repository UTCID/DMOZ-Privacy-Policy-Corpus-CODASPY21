You may choose whether to provide personal information online.
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable
to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's
name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not
considered personal information.
We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to

may choose not to contact us by email, participate in a survey, or to provide any
personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these
activities will not impair your ability to browse the Edmonds College website and
read or download any information provided on the site.
If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state
law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information
is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and
copying if not protected by federal or state law.
If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than
what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Vice President of Human Resources,
as shown in the Contact Information Section of this statement.
The Edmonds College website is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect
any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of
personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail
will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public
access.
Public Access to Information
In the state of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that
the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by
state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to
access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.
Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.
All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject
to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
RCW 42.17.260(1) states that
Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection
and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions
of subsection (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or
other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records.
To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests
protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details
in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or
publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion
shall be explained fully in writing.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act
or other law governing the agencys disclosure of records, the Public Records Act
or other applicable law will control.
