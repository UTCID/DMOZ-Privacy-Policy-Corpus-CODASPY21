Discrimination Policy
The University of Exeter is committed to equality of opportunity and does not discriminate on grounds of age, disability, race, sex or beliefs. Where we ask for information about such matters, it is to comply with our legal obligations or to assist us in allocating appropriate accommodation to students’ needs and preferences. Collection of payment is more risky, difficult and expensive from overseas, and payment procedures for international students may vary from payment procedures for UK students to reflect that.
