Minors on Campus (Virtual)
Due to COVID-19 and the current safety measures the University has implemented to ensure the safety of University students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors, the University has canceled all in person summer programs, activities, and events aimed at minors. HSC campus safety measures for COVID-19 state children of students and employees are not allowed on campus.
In response to the COVID-19 restrictions, the Minors on Campus Committee has created the University Virtual Programs Aimed at Minors Protocols and Release forms that can be utilized for University sponsored programs for minors if employees wish to host activities in a virtual format.
