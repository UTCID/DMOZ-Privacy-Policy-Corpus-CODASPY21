AIM Hallmarks
What are the AIM Hallmarks?
The AIM Hallmarks distil and share the experience of two generations of leaders of independent, innovative and imaginative museums, combined with respected thinking and research. Since they were first published in 2015, AIM has worked with museums and heritage organisations across the UK to put the ideas in the Hallmarks into practice.

Hallmarks at Home
Hallmarks at Home takes the existing principles and applies them to the recovery and reopening of the museum sector post-coronavirus. This programme of online events is intended to help AIM members get into the best position to prosper and thrive in the long-term.
To see what events are coming up and book your place, please visit our events page.
All events are free and take place via Zoom. Places are limited, giving you the chance to have your own questions answered and hear from fellow AIM members facing similar challenges to you.
