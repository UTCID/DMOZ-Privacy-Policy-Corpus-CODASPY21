UVM's Institutional Policies Website
WELCOME TO UVM’S POLICIES WEBSITEThis site is the definitive source for official, approved, and most recent versions of University Policies, University Operating Procedures (UOPs), and University Guidelines.  University Policies, UOPs or University Guidelines located on other websites may be incorrect or obsolete.  Individual departments are advised to link to this site rather than placing a copy of a University Policy, UOP or Guideline on their own websites.
One goal of the Office of Compliance and Privacy Services is to simplify the understanding of the many external laws, regulations and University Policies, UOPs and Guidelines that members of the University community need to follow and to help them make good decisions.  With this goal in mind, please share your thoughts on how we can improve our services.  Call us at  (802) 656-3086 or email us at policy@uvm.edu.WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICIES?This site is managed by the Office of Compliance and Privacy Services; however, Responsible Officials (ROs) have full responsibility for the content and regular review and update of University Policies, UOPs and University Guidelines.DOES THIS SITE CONTAIN ALL UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES?No. This site only hosts institution-wide Policies, Procedures and Guidelines. Individual departments, units, colleges or divisions may have their own policies, procedures and/or guidelines that apply to operations for those particular areas.Additional policies that pertain to academic processes or specific University groups not listed below are posted separately. Click on “Additional Policies” section on the right menu for links to these policies.HOW DO I KNOW IF I’VE GOT THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF A POLICY, UOP OR GUIDELINE?Any time a policy has a leading web address of https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/, it indicates that the policy resides on this site and is the most current version available. If you are looking at a website that does not start with that leading web address, there is a chance it is not the most current.MY DEPARTMENT HAS A POLICY THAT CONFLICTS WITH ONE ON THIS SITE. WHICH ONE DO I FOLLOW?Official University Policies, UOPs, and University Guidelines will always supersede those local-level policies, procedures and/or guidelines regarding issues of University-wide application and in the event of a conflict between policies.
