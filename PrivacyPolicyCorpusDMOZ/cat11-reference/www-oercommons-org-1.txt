Accessibility

The “Learner Options” feature allows you to change the display of some elements of the site to meet your unique viewing preferences. The feature is found in the top right-hand corner of each page of the OERC Platform. You can find a step by step guide with images here: https://www.oercommons.org/authoring/1504-oer-commons-learner-options/view.
Pages on the OERC Platform are intended to be compatible with screen readers and accessible to keyboard navigation.

The OERC Platform supports several AFA and A11y metadata fields. Use the Accessibility criteria in Advanced Search to find resources that include features such as ARIA long descriptions, transcripts, and captions, or that support specific learning modes such as auditory, visual, or textual.
Limitations to Accessibility. While ISKME strives to ensure the accessibility of the OERC Platform, you may find some limitations.

You can learn more about creating material via Open Author at https://www.oercommons.org/authoring-overview#open-author-section.

ISKME endeavors to provide information about the copyright status of the educational materials in the OERC Platform, and to identify any other terms and conditions that may apply to your use of such materials. However, ISKME offers no guarantee or assurance that all pertinent information is provided or that the information provided is correct in each circumstance. In all cases, it is your sole responsibility to determine what permission(s) you may need in order to use materials available from the OERC Platform and, if necessary, to obtain such permission(s).

Please note that Educational Materials and metadata are not considered User Content, but rather are discussed above, in the section titled Educational Materials.

We make User Content and Educational Material (including its metadata) available at our sole discretion and may disable access to any User Content or Educational Material at any time and for any reason. By using the OERC Platform, you acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee access to and/or hosting of User Content or Educational Material that is published through the OERC Platform.
