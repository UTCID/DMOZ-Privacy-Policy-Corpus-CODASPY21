In order to enter into a contract, we will need certain information, for example your name and address. A contract will also contain obligations on both your part and our part, and we shall process your data as is necessary for the purpose of those obligations. For example, in order to process payroll, a national insurance number and bank details will be required.
2. Compliance with legal obligations (regulatory and statutory obligations):
We must comply with a number of statutory provisions when providing our Recruitment Services, which necessitate the processing of personal data. These include the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, which amongst other things requires us to:

Section 3: This section applies to all personal data
Transfer of data to other jurisdictions
In the course of the provision of our Recruitment Services we may transfer data to countries or international organisations outside of the EEA. This may, for example, be to Clients or Candidates, or third parties who provide support services to us. Where information is to be so transferred, it may be to a country in respect of which there is an adequacy decision from the EU Commission. However, if this is not the case, it is our policy to take steps to identify risks and in so far as is reasonably practicable, ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. This would only apply when individuals are applying for roles in overseas international schools and is done at the request of the candidate.
If you do not wish to provide us with necessary data
There may be circumstances where we require you to provide data which is necessary in order for us to meet statutory or contractual obligations or perform our Recruitment Services. If you do not wish to provide us with information, we request then please notify us. However, please be aware that as a result we may be unable to provide you or the party who you represent with a Recruitment Service, and in some cases may result in a breach of the contract we have with you or a third party you represent.
Group companies transfer
Although this Privacy Notice applies to us your data may be accessible to, and shared with other organisations within our branch offices and our subsidiary companies of Eteach Group for any of the purposes set out within this Privacy Notice, or where we have shared administration systems and staff.In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or the transfer of all or part of our assets to a third party, we may need to transfer your information to a third party. Any transfer will be subject to the agreement of the third party to this Privacy Notice and any processing being only in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Data Security and Confidentiality
It is our policy to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, that our systems and records are secure and not accessible to unauthorised third parties in line with contemporary practice.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is downloaded on to your computer when you visit a website, which enables the website to tailor its offerings to your preferences when you visit it.View our Cookies Policy here: https://www.eteach.com/cookies/
Retaining your data
In most circumstances your data will not be retained for more than 6 years from the last point at which we provided any services or otherwise engaged with you and it is our policy to only store your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate business interests. However, we may retain data for longer than a 6 year period where we have a legal or contractual obligation to do so, or we form the view that there is otherwise a continued basis to do so, for example where your personal information identifies specialist skill sets which may remain in demand, or we are subject to a legal obligation which applies for a longer period.If, however you believe that we should delete your personal data at an earlier date, please inform us in writing of your reasons. Please see Section 4 'Your Rights' below.
Changes to this Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice is regularly reviewed and may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our business, or legal or commercial practice. Where an update is relevant to our processing of your data, we shall notify you of the same.
Section 4: Your rights
We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and it is important that you know your rights within that context, which include rights to:• Request a copy of the personal data that we hold• Object to our processing of your data where that processing is based upon legitimate interest and there are no compelling grounds for the continued processing of that data• Request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances• Request that data is erased where the continued use of that data cannot be justified• Object to any decision, which significantly affects you, being taken solely by a computer or via another automated process• Withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data for a particular purpose at any stage. However, please note that we may continue to retain, or otherwise use your personal information thereafter where we have a legitimate interest or a legal or contractual obligation to do so. Our processing in that respect will be limited to what is necessary in furtherance of those interests or obligations• Request that inaccurate or incomplete data is rectified• Request that data provided directly by you and processed by automated means is transferred to you or another controller; this right only being applicable where our processing of your data is based either on your consent or in performance of a contract• Make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office Request that direct marketing by us to you is stopped
Please note that should you exercise your right to request that we erase data or cease any processing activity, we may retain a record of this request and the action taken in order to both evidence our compliance, and to take steps to minimise the prospect of any data being processed in the future should it be received again from a third party source.
If you have any questions concerning your rights or should you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact gdpr@eteach.com.
Complaints
If you are dissatisfied about any aspect of the way in which your data is processed you may, in the first instance refer the matter to gdpr@eteach.com. This does not affect your right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office.
