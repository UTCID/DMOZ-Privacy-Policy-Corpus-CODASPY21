Advertising Events Online
Use of technology to advertise University events is often the most convenient and direct way of reaching the Detroit Mercy community. Many areas within the University host events and too much advertising of all these events can be overwhelming for any individual. At many universities, advertising of events is centrally controlled but Detroit Mercy has yet to take this step. All use of technology for advertising have rules and restrictions that are enforced. Before attempting to advertise, please become familiar with the rules and restrictions.
Advertising via Email Listservs
The ITS department manages a number of specialized listservs to provide a convenient way to reach various groups of the Detroit Mercy community very easily. Members of the community are automatically enrolled based upon their status. A guideline on when and how to use the lists was created by the Shared Governance IT Team and adopted as policy by the ITS department. Senders who wish to use these listservs should review the guidelines in their entirety before attempting to send a message. All messages send (except those to the faculty listserv) are reviewed by an individual during normal business hours before being released for distribution. The guidelines are available here.
Advertising via Detroit Mercy TitanTV Channels 97 or 98
The ITS department manages the closed-circuit cable TV environment that provides service to the 500+ residence rooms as well as various locations across the McNichols campus. Two of the channels on the system, 97 and 98, are dedicated to Detroit Mercy content. Channel 97 provides video content and channel 98 is the standard public access content station that provides a sequence of slides of events. Promotional information for University events may be requested for play on either channel by submitting the request through the ITS Help Desk system (hd.udmercy.edu) and selecting the appropriate category. Video content will need to be provided in an MPG or MP4 format.
Advertising via My Portal Announcements Channel
When users log into My Portal, an Announcements channel is presented and generally contains information pertaining to major events taking place on campus. To request the posting of a message in the My Portal Announcements channel, please submit a Help Desk ticket.
Advertising via Campus Connection
Authored by the Marketing & Public Affairs department, Campus Connection is an electronic newsletter that contains information on University events, news and employee accomplishments.  It is published on a varying schedule (typically once a week during Term I and II and once a month during the summer). To submit information for Campus Connection, visit the newsletter and use the "Submit News/Events" link.
Advertising via the Detroit Mercy Events Calendar
The public events calendar is also maintained by the Marketing & Public Affairs department, which determines which events to include.
McNichols Campus events will be considered for the calendar if they are submitted via the Event Request process and promotion is asked for in the request form.
For consideration of events scheduled on the Riverfront (Law) or Corktown (Dentistry) campuses, send information to marketing.pub.aff@udmercy.edu.
Advertising via www.udmercy.edu
Requests for advertisement on the University's main website should be submitted to the Marketing & Public Affairs department. Bear in mind that the main website is intended primarily for recruitment of potential students.
Advertising via Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
Requests for advertisement on the University's official Facebook and Twitter accounts should be submitted to the Marketing & Public Affairs department.
