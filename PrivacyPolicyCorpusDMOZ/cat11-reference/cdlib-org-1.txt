The California Digital Library is a unit within the department of Academic Planning, Programs, and Coordination at the UC Office of the President. The UC Office of the President promulgates the majority of policies that guide the CDL, most notably in the area of information technology. When appropriate, CDL develops policies specific to its role within the UC and broader digital library communities.
