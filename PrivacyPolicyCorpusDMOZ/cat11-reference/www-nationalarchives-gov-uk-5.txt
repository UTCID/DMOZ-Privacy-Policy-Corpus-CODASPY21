Cookies
When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on the device you are using, for example, your computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as ‘cookies’. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
These pieces of information are used to improve services and ensure they work for you through:
enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task
recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested
measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast
You can manage internet browser cookies yourself and learn more about them by visiting Gov.uk.
