15. TERMINATION.
These Terms of Use, as may be modified from time to time by us without notice, are effective until we provide notice of termination thereof on our Site. You agree to be bound by the Terms of Use as displayed on the Site at the time you use the Site and/or any part of the Service provided in connection therewith. You may not terminate any provision of these Terms of Use. Your sole and exclusive remedy in the event that you no longer desire to be bound by any of the provisions of these Terms of Use is to discontinue your access and use of our Site and the Service, and to destroy all Materials and other items obtained from the Site, whether pursuant to the License, or otherwise, together with all related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, except for purchased products. We may terminate your access to our Site, and/or any part of the Service, at any time in our sole discretion, and we reserve the right at any time to discontinue the operation of the Site, and/or the provision of any part of the Service. We may immediately terminate your right to access and/or use our Site and/or the Service, without notice, if, in our sole discretion, you fail to comply with any provision of these Terms of Use.
16. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
16.1 You acknowledge and agree that the unauthorized use of our Site, Information, Content, Materials, and/or any part of the Service could cause irreparable harm to us and/or organizations or individuals that may be associated with us. Accordingly, you agree that that in the event of any unauthorized use of our Site, any Information, Content, Materials, and/or any part of the Service, we shall be entitled to obtain an injunction proscribing such unauthorized use, without the necessity to post bond, and in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.
16.2 These Terms of Use, as may be amended by us from time to time, constitute our entire agreement with respect to your use of our Site and the Service. These Terms of Use supersede all prior agreements, understandings and representations between us with respect to your use of our Site and the Service. You cannot amend or alter the terms of these Terms of Use.
16.3 These Terms of Use, including the License, are personal to you, and neither can be assigned by you. You agree not to allow any other person to access and/or use our Site or the Service unless such other person agrees to be bound all of the provisions of these Terms of Use. You further agree to assume all responsibility and liability arising from any third party access to, or use of, our Site and/or the Service (a) using, or under, any of Your Accounts, or any of your Passwords; and (b) that you permit, knowing that such third party has not agreed to be bound by all of the provisions of these Terms of Use.
16.4 We may at times send you information by e-mail that we believe will be of interest to you. If you register at any of our Sites, and you do not want to receive e-mails from us, please let us know by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the message received or contacting us through information on the Site.
16.5 If any provision of these Terms of Use is finally found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid, unenforceable or otherwise contrary to law or equity, the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use that can be given effect without such void or unenforceable term or provision, shall be given full effect and binding on the parties.
16.6 Our failure to enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use, or to penalize any violation by you of these Terms of Use, shall not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use, or to penalize you for any further violations of any provision of these Terms of Use.
16.7 These Terms of Use shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving any effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity, and/or any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, our Site, the Service, and/or your access, and/or use, of any of CTI's Sites or the Service, shall be filed and litigated only in the state or federal courts located in DuPage County, Illinois. You hereby consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action or claim.
16.8 All of the provisions of these Terms of Use, which by their nature, survive the termination of these Terms of Use, shall so survive, including without limitation, the provisions of Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
