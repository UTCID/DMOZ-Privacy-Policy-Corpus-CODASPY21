Privacy Policy
for Quandaries and Queries that you submit:
Identification information: We use this data (1) to contact you by email when we have posted your question and our reply on the web site and (2) to understand which broad categories of the public are making the most use of this service (information is aggregated). When we post your question and our reply to our database/web site, we don't post last names or email addresses. If you identified yourself as a teacher, for example, we just add one to our total of teacher-originated questions.
Question itself: When you send us a question, you are giving us permission to post the question (and any clarifying information you may subsequently send us) on the site along with our response. This is an educational website and much of its value to the public lies in demonstrating how to solve real questions from the public through its Quandaries and Queries archive.
If you have any further questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at
