The AUC Woodruff Library’s Brawley Greenscape and Pedestrian Parkway is an outdoor area intended to be enjoyed by students, faculty and other members of the AUC. Reading, studying, socializing and organized events are some of the activities that can be enjoyed in the Greenscape.
To ensure a safe and pleasant environment and to maintain the beauty and functionality of the space, specific guidelines have been implemented and must be observed by everyone who uses the Greenscape. Additionally, rental policies have been put in place to govern the rental process and use of the Greenscape for special events.
