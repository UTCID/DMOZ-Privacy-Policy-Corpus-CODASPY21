Terms & Conditions
1. Services
Libsuite Hospitality Hosting  provides a number of services to its customers. The services and products provided to you by Libsuite Hospitality Hosting , as set out on our website, are referred to as the Services. We provide the Services to you based on the description of them on our website as of the Effective Date. Should our website change subsequent to the Effective Date, we have no obligation to modify the Services to reflect such a change.
The Services may be provided by third parties. These third parties may have reserved the right to make changes, including material changes, to the services provided by them. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you of those changes. However, you may not terminate this TOS based on such a change by a third party.
Domain Name Services
We resell domain names. When you apply to register a domain name, your request is transmitted to Internet.bs. You are bound by Internet.BS ‘s domain name registration policies and procedures. These policies and procedures are available on the website. Because there is often a period of time between your registration request and the actual registration of the domain name, we do not guarantee that your registration domain name will be registered.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or update domain names. However, circumstances beyond our control, such as billing issues, may result in your domain name failing to register, or to lapse. Our liability in such a case is limited by paragraph 12 below. For this reason, it is your obligation to ensure that your domain name does not lapse.
Virtual Private Server
If you purchase Virtual Private Server services from us, you also agree to be bound by Part B of this TOS which provides additional terms and conditions that govern our Virtual Private Server services. Part B supplements this TOS. Its provisions do not replace it.
cPanel
Please review paragraph 3(b) of the cPanel End User License Agreement (http://www.cpanel.net/eula.html). It is expressly incorporated into this TOS by reference.
2. Contact Information
You are required to provide us with accurate information when setting up your account, during the course of our relationship, and when corresponding with us. On occasion, we may need to communicate with you by e-mail about the Services. You agree to maintain a working e-mail address that is monitored daily. We have no responsibility, or liability, for interruptions in the Services, or damages of any sort, based on communications that are misdirected as a result of your failure to provide us with updated contact information.
3. Term
All prospective customers are subject to a credit check and screening for potential fraud. We are not bound by this TOS until these procedures are completed to our satisfaction.
The “Effective Date” of this TOS will be the day on which we receive payment from you.
This TOS will begin on the Effective Date and continue for the term set out on the page describing the Services (Initial Term). After the expiration of the Initial Term, this TOS will renew for successive periods of equal length (Renewal Term). If the page describing the Services does not contain an Initial Term, the Initial Term shall be one month.
4. Payment
Your invoice is generated 10 days prior to its due date. The due date is the day of the month you signed up (Due Date). Your credit card will be charged on the Due Date. You are responsible for the fees and charges set out on the page describing the Services you have purchased, according to the terms set out on that page. In addition, certain aspects of the Services may be billed by third parties to you, through us. All of these are referred to collectively as “Fees.”
5. Termination
Either party may terminate the services by providing written notice to the other no later than 25 days from the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term.
We reserve the right to immediately terminate this TOS, and suspend or cancel the Services: (i) for a violation of any of our policies, including those incorporated by reference; and/or (ii) your failure to pay any amounts due. This right of termination is without prejudice to any other rights we may have. You are not entitled to any type of notice or protest should we exercise these rights.
Upon termination, your account will be closed. We have no responsibility to forward e-mail, or other communications, for you once your account is closed. You are encouraged to keep the Service active during a transition period should you seek to forward your e-mail or other communications.
One party may also terminate this TOS upon the occurrence of a material breach, which has not been cured by the other party within 10 days of their receipt of written notice of the breach. For the purposes of defining a material breach, materiality shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable business person with significant experience in Internet business. Notices of material breach must contain sufficient detail for the party against whom the assertion of material breach is directed to identify the breach and attempt to take corrective action.
6. Cancellation
You may cancel this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to us as provided in the paragraph entitled “Termination” We only accept cancellations through our online cancellation form found in My Libsuite Hospitality Hosting. It is important to note that if the Order Form contains a term commitment, you will be responsible for all termination charges based on your cancellation. The fact that you cancel this Agreement does not relieve you of responsibility for these charges. If you have a term agreement with us, we strongly suggest you contact prior to canceling to determine what your cancellation obligations will be.
7. Money Back Guarantee
Hosting services carry an unconditional 30 day satisfaction guarantee. To cancel your hosting services and receive a refund, you must contact us within 30 days from the Effective Date of the particular Services you wish to cancel. Only your monthly fees are refundable. Set up, domain name registration, SSL Certificate, and other one-time fees are not refundable. If you paid us by credit card we will credit the card on file, Paypal payments will be refunded on-line. Payments made by check are not refundable. Any custom orders or configuration setups are non-refundable.
8. Use of the Services
Your use of the Services are governed by our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Privacy Policy which are incorporated into this TOS by reference. In the event of inconsistencies between this TOS and the AUP, on the one hand, or the Privacy Policy, on the other, the AUP or Privacy Policy shall govern.
The terms “unlimited” and “unmetered” are defined by our experience with similarly situated customers. This means that your use of our resources may not exceed that of similarly situated customers. Examples of primary purposes for an account that are not allowed include, but are not limited to:
Audio/Video streaming (other than that which is incidental to a site’s operation)
Very large photo galleries
Storage of a large amount of uncompressed or full-size digital images
Online file (FTP) serving
Distribution of large audio or video content such as MP3 files
Online backups (i.e. backup of desktop/laptop computer, files, or anything not directly related to the website)
You may not place excessive burdens on our CPUs, servers or other resources, including our customer support services. You understand that bandwidth, connection speeds and other similar indices of capacity are maximum numbers. Consistently reaching these capacity numbers may result our need to place restrictions on your use of the Services. You agree that we may place restrictions on your use of the Services or customer support services to the extent that they exceed the use of these resources by similarly situated customers.
Shared Hosting accounts are allowed to use a maximum of 300,000 inodes and 35 concurrent HTTP connections to the server. cPanel backups older than 90-days in a customer account may be removed from the server at our discretion. Complimentary Server Rewind for shared web hosting backups are limited to a 50GB quota. If you exceed 50GB of disk usage in your account, your account will no longer be backed up. Please download any cPanel backups and store them locally.
