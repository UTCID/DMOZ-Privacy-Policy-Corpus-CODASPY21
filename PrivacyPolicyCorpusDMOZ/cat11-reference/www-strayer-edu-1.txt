Ownership of Our Sites and Their Content
Our Sites, including all of the software and code comprising or used
to operate our Sites, and all of the text, photographs, images,
illustrations, graphics, sound recordings, video and audio-video
clips, and other materials available on our Sites, including without
limitation content submitted by users of our Sites (collectively
“Content”) are protected under applicable intellectual property and
other laws, including without limitation the laws of the United States
and other countries. All Content and intellectual property rights
therein are the property of SEI or the material is included with the
permission of the rights owner and is protected pursuant to applicable
copyright and trademark laws.
The presence of any Content on our Sites does not constitute a
waiver of any right in such Content. You do not acquire ownership
rights to any such Content viewed through our Sites. Except as
otherwise provided herein, none of this Content may be used, copied,
reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, modified, displayed,
posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including, but not
limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or
otherwise, without our express prior written permission.
Permission is hereby granted to the extent necessary to lawfully
access and use our Sites and to display, download, or print portions
of our Sites on a temporary basis and for your personal, educational,
noncommercial use only, provided that you (i) do not modify the
Content; (ii) you retain any and all copyright and other proprietary
notices contained in the Content; and (iii) you do not copy or post
the Content on any network computer or broadcast the Content in any media.
Responsibility for User Generated Content Posted on our Sites
In these Terms of Use, “User Generated Content” refers to all of the
text, photographs, images, illustrations, graphics, sounds, video and
audio-video clips, and other content you and others post on or through
our Sites that does not constitute “Feedback”.
You are responsible for User Generated Content you post on our
Sites. You are solely responsible for the User Generated
Content that you post on our Sites. Under no circumstances will we be
liable in any way for any User Generated Content posted to our Sites.
Such User Generated Content may be posted on or accessed through our
Sites in our sole discretion.
This means that you, not SEI, are entirely responsible for all User
Generated Content that you upload, post, transmit or otherwise make
available to others using our Sites and that you can be held
personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or
libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of
confidentiality, or the rights of others.  If any part of the User
Generated Content you submit is not your original work, it is your
responsibility to obtain any necessary permissions before you post
that User Generated Content on our Sites.
Because we do not control the User Generated Content posted on our
Sites, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness,
integrity, suitability, or quality of that User Generated Content. You
also agree and understand that by accessing our Sites, you may
encounter User Generated Content that you may consider to be
objectionable. We have no responsibility for any User Generated
Content, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein.
We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you claim was
incurred as a result of the use of any User Generated Content posted,
e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on our Sites,
whether by us, individual users of the Sites, or our third-party
contractors or licensors. The communications posted on our Sites
express the personal opinions of the individuals who posted them and
do not necessarily reflect the views of SEI or any person or entity
associated with SEI.
You own User Generated Content you submit, but we may use it.
With the exception of Feedback, which is defined and addressed
below, and to the extent your UGC is copyrightable, you own the
copyright in any original work you post on or through our Sites. We do
not claim any copyrights in User Generated Content created and posted
by individual visitors to our Sites, unless that User Generated
Content constitutes Feedback. However, by uploading, posting,
transmitting or otherwise making any User Generated Content available
on or through our Sites, you are granting us and our subsidiaries,
affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid,
worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license
(with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of
sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and
perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and
commercialize that User Generated Content in any and all media or form
of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without
obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or
attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize
others to do the same.  For this reason, we ask that you not send us
any User Generated Content that you do not wish to license to us,
including any confidential information or product ideas. Please see
our Privacy Policy for a description of how we may
use certain types of User Generated Content that you post on our Sites.
We may disclose and/or remove User Generated Content. SEI
reserves certain rights.  SEI reserves the right (but does not have
the obligation) to monitor all User Generated Content.  We reserve the
right to require that you avoid certain subjects if we believe that
doing so will help ensure compliance with applicable laws.  We reserve
the right (but do not assume the obligation) to remove any User
Generated Content at any time without notice at our sole and absolute
discretion.  We reserve the right to disclose any User Generated
Content and the identity of the user who posted or transmitted that
User Generated Content in response to a subpoena or whenever we
believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a
court order, to prevent or investigate a possible crime or other
violation of law, to protect the rights of SEI or others, or to
enforce these Terms of Use. In addition, we reserve the right (but do
not assume the obligation) to terminate your access to and use of any
of our Sites, or to censor, edit or block your transmissions thereto
in our sole discretion. You agree that our exercise of such discretion
shall not render us the owners of the User Generated Content, and the
user who made such User Generated Content available on the Sites will
retain ownership thereof as described above.
Restrictions on User Generated Content. It is a condition of
these Terms and Conditions that you do not:
upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any
User Generated Content that is unlawful, harmful, hateful,
threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene,
vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially disparaging, indecent,
or invasive of another’s privacy; any User Generated
Content that constitutes or promotes any illegal activity,
including, without limitation, any User Generated Content
constituting or encouraging conduct that would be a criminal
offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any
local, state, national or foreign law; any User
Generated Content that is false, misleading, or fraudulent;
any User Generated Content that you do not have a right to
make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary
relationships (such as inside information or proprietary and
confidential information learned or disclosed as part of
employment relationships or under nondisclosure
agreements); any User Generated Content that violates or
infringes upon the rights of others, including User Generated
Content which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark
rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights,
confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of
any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity;
any User Generated Content that contains the image, name or
likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person
is at least eighteen years old and you have first obtained
his/her express permission or (ii) that person is under eighteen
years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
any request for or solicitation of any personal or private
information from any individual; any request for or
solicitation of money, goods, or services for private
gain;  any material that contains software viruses or any
other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt,
destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or
hardware or telecommunications equipment; or any User
Generated Content that contains advertising, promotions or
marketing, or which otherwise has a commercial purpose.
impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or
otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
or violate any local, state, national or international law,
rule or regulation.
By posting User Generated Content to our Sites, you represent and
warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the
User Generated Content you post and have the right to grant the
license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the User Generated
Content you post is accurate; and (iii) you are at least eighteen
years old and you have read and understood—and your User Generated
Content fully complies with—these Terms of Use and applicable laws and
will not cause injury to any person or entity.
Remember, you are legally responsible for your User Generated
Content.  You can be held personally liable if your User Generated
Content is defamatory, obscene, or libelous, violates an obligation of
confidentiality, or violates the rights of others.  You are also
legally responsible for any User Generated Content submitted by anyone
logging onto our Sites using your username and password, including
those doing so without your authorization.
Your Feedback
In these Terms of Use, “Feedback” refers to information you submit
to us through our Sites that is specifically about how we can improve
our Sites and the courses, information, and services we make available
through our Sites.  Although we do not claim ownership of User
Generated Content you post on or through our Sites, the Feedback you
provide to us through our Sites will be and remain our exclusive
property.  Your submission of Feedback will constitute an assignment
to us of all worldwide rights, title and interests in your Feedback,
including all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in
your Feedback.  We will be entitled to reduce to practice, exploit,
make, use, copy, disclose, display or perform publicly, distribute,
improve and modify any Feedback you submit for any purpose whatsoever,
without restriction and without compensating you in any way.  For this
reason, we ask that you not send us any Feedback that you do not wish
to assign to us.
Removal of Content
In general. If you believe Content on our Sites violates your
rights or is otherwise inappropriate and you want us to remove it, you
may be able to flag it. Otherwise, please contact us at the
information above. While we do not have any obligation to remove
Content merely because of a removal request, we will review all such
requests and will remove Content that we determine should be removed,
in our sole discretion and in accordance with our Terms of Use,
Privacy Policy, and applicable law.
Violation of copyrights.
SEI does not knowingly violate or permit others to
violate the copyrights of others.  We will promptly remove or disable
access to material that we know is infringing or if we become aware of
circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.
If you are requesting removal of Content because of a violation of
your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who
believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights
under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your own work, or the
work of a third party for whom you are authorized to act, is featured
on any of our Sites or has been otherwise copied and made available on
our Sites in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please
notify our DMCA Designated Agent immediately.  Your notice must be in
writing and must include
an electronic or physical signature of
the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of the copyright interest; a description of the
copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; a
description of where the material that you claim is infringing is
located on our Sites (including the URL, title and/or item number if
applicable, or other identifying characteristics); your
name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, and, if you are
not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner; a
written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the
disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
the law; and a statement by you, made under penalty of
perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and
that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the
copyright owner's behalf.
Your statement may be e-mailed to legal@StrategicEd.com or mailed to
the following address:
Strategic Education, Inc. Office of the General Counsel
ATTN: DMCA Designated Agent 2303 Dulles Station Blvd. Mail
Stop 6C Herndon, VA 20171
Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act
on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall
not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer
upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which
infringing material or acts are evident.
Trademarks
The SEI names and logos, all product and service names, all page
headers, all custom graphics, all button icons, and all trademarks,
service marks and logos appearing on our Sites, unless otherwise
noted, are trademarks (whether registered or not), service marks
and/or trade dress of SEI (the “SEI Marks”). All other trademarks,
product names, company names, logos, service marks and/or trade dress
mentioned, displayed, cited or otherwise indicated on our Sites are
the property of their respective owners. You are not authorized to
display or use the SEI Marks in any manner without our prior written
permission. You are not authorized to display or use trademarks,
product names, company names, logos, service marks and/or trade dress
of other owners featured on our Sites without the prior written
permission of such owners. The use or misuse of the SEI Marks or other
trademarks, product names, company names, logos, service marks and/or
trade dress or any other materials contained herein, except as
permitted herein, is expressly prohibited. In particular, you may not
use any trademark displayed on our Sites as a “hot” link without the
prior written approval of the trademark owner.
Your Obligations
In consideration of your use of our Sites, you agree to provide
true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself.
Your account, including your username and password, are personal to
you and may not be used by anyone else. You are responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of your password and username and are
fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or
username by you or by anyone else using your username and password,
whether or not authorized by you. You agree to change your password
immediately if you believe your password may have been compromised or
used without authorization. You also agree to immediately inform us of
any apparent breaches of security such as loss, theft or unauthorized
disclosure or use of your username or password. Until we are so
notified you will remain liable for any unauthorized use of your account.
You agree to use our Sites in a manner consistent with any and all
applicable rules and regulations. You agree not to upload or transmit
through our Sites any computer viruses, trojan horses, worms or
anything else designed to interfere with, interrupt or disrupt the
normal operating procedures of a computer. Any unauthorized
modification, tampering or change of any information, or any
interference with the availability of or access to our Sites is
strictly prohibited. We reserve all rights and remedies available to us.
You agree to indemnify, release and hold us harmless as well as our
officers, directors, agents, representatives and employees from any
claim, liability, loss, expense or demand, including legal fees,
related to your violation of these Terms and Conditions or your access
or use of our Sites (including any information, materials, products or
services available through our Sites).
DISCLAIMERS
WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO OUR SITES
OR THEIR CONTENT, OR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE AVAILABLE ON OR PROMOTED
THROUGH OUR SITES. OUR SITES AND ALL OF THEIR CONTENT (INCLUDING USER
GENERATED CONTENT) ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS,
WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SEI, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SERVICE
PROVIDERS AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY STATUTE, CUSTOM,
COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR IN ANY OTHER WAY, WITH
RESPECT TO OUR SITES, THEIR CONTENT, AND ANY COURSES, PROGRAMS,
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SITES.  WITHOUT
LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SEI, ITS AFFILIATES, AND
THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES (A) OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (B) RELATING TO THE SECURITY OF OUR SITES;
(C) THAT THE CONTENT OR OTHER INFORMATION ON OUR SITES, OR TO ANY
SITES WITH WHICH THEY ARE LINKED, IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE OR CURRENT; OR
(D) THAT OUR SITES WILL OPERATE SECURELY OR WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERROR.
WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR SITES, THEIR SERVERS, OR ANY
TRANSMISSIONS SENT FROM US OR THROUGH OUR SITES WILL BE FREE OF ANY
HARMFUL COMPONENTS (INCLUDING VIRUSES).
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT
APPEARING ON OUR SITES. WE DO NOT ENDORSE ANY OPINION, ADVICE,
COMMENT, OR STATEMENT MADE ON OUR SITES BY USERS OF OUR SITES. USER
GENERATED CONTENT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REFLECT THE OPINION, ADVICE, OR
STATEMENT OF SEI. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MISDELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE
COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA. YOU ACCEPT THAT
OUR SHAREHOLDERS, OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS CLAUSE.
APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES,
SO ALL OR PART OF THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY USER
GENERATED CONTENT. ALTHOUGH WE INCLUDE STRICT PROVISIONS REGARDING
USER GENERATED CONTENT IN THESE TERMS OF USE, WE DO NOT CONTROL AND
ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT USERS POST ON OR THROUGH OUR SITES AND
ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OFFENSIVE, INAPPROPRIATE, OBSCENE,
UNLAWFUL, INFRINGING OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE OR ILLEGAL USER
GENERATED CONTENT YOU MAY ENCOUNTER ON OUR SITES OR IN CONNECTION WITH
YOUR USE OF OUR SITES.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, WE, ON BEHALF OF
OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND
SERVICE PROVIDERS, EXCLUDE AND DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSSES AND
EXPENSES OF WHATEVER NATURE AND HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; LOSS OF USE; LOSS OF DATA; LOSS
CAUSED BY A VIRUS; LOSS OF INCOME OR PROFIT; LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO
PROPERTY; CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES; OR OTHER LOSSES OF ANY KIND OR
CHARACTER, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OUR
SITES OR ANY WEBSITE WITH WHICH THEY ARE LINKED, OR ANY MERCHANDISE
AVAILABLE ON OUR SITES. YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ESTABLISHING SUCH PROCEDURES FOR DATA BACK UP AND VIRUS CHECKING AS
YOU CONSIDER NECESSARY. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES WHETHER
THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS.
IF ANY PART OF THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID
OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE
RELEASED PARTIES FOR LIABILITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN
LIMITED SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10.00).
These Terms of Use give you specific legal rights and you may also
have other rights which vary from country to country. Some
jurisdictions do not allow certain kinds of limitations or exclusions
of liability, so the limitations and exclusions set out in these Terms
of Use may not apply to you. Other jurisdictions allow limitations and
exclusions subject to certain conditions. In such a case, the
limitations and exclusions set out in these Terms of Use shall apply
to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable
jurisdictions. Your statutory rights as a consumer, if any, are not
affected by these provisions, and we do not seek to exclude or limit
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.
Links to Sites Operated by Third Parties
Certain portions of our Sites may be “powered by” third parties. In
addition, our Sites may provide links to Websites operated by third
parties.  We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we
do not warrant the products or offerings of, any of these businesses
or individuals or the accuracy or content of their Websites.  We do
not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product,
and content of any such sites.  Before you use any site you should
review the applicable conditions of use and policies.  The inclusion
of a link in our Sites does not imply our endorsement of the site.  If
you decide to access linked third-party websites, you do so at your
own risk.
Modification and Discontinuation
We reserve the right at any time and from time-to-time to modify,
edit, delete, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently our
Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or the information, materials,
products and/or services available through our Sites (or any portion
thereof) with or without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable
to you or to any third party for any such modification, editing,
deletion, suspension or discontinuance of our Sites.
Interpretation
As used in these Terms of Use, the term “including” means
“including, but not limited to.”
Waiver
Our failure at any time to require performance of any provision of
these Terms of Use or to exercise any right provided for herein will
not be deemed a waiver of such provision or such
right.  All waivers must be in writing.  Unless the written waiver
contains an express statement to the contrary, no waiver by SEI of any
breach of any provision of these Terms of Use or of any right provided
for herein will be construed as a waiver of any continuing or
succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself,
or a waiver of any right under these Terms of Use.
Severability
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be
changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the
original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the
remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force
and effect.
Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue
These Terms of Use will be governed under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to its conflicts of law
provisions.  All actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to
these Terms of Use will be venued exclusively in state or federal
court in Fairfax County, Virginia.  You hereby irrevocably consent and
submit to the personal jurisdiction of said courts for all such
purposes. However, we retain the right to bring legal proceedings in
any jurisdiction where we believe that infringement of his agreement
is taking place or originating.
Entire Agreement
