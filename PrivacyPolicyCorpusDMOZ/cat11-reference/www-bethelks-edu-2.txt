Refund Policy and Return of Title IV Funds
Refund Policy and Return of Title IV Funds
Federal regulations require each educational institution to have a written policy for the refund and repayment of aid received by students who withdraw from all classes during a term for which aid has been approved. These policies are effective only if the student completely terminates enrollment (e.g., voluntarily withdraws from all classes or is dismissed from all classes.)
Title IV funds include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Subsidized/Unsubsidized Family Federal Education Loan and the Federal Plus Loan. At Bethel College the same policy will be used for state, institutional and outside aid sources.
Tuition and room and board charges for students who withdraw or are dismissed on or after the first day of classes during the semester will be prorated on a daily basis, including weekends, over the first 60% of the semester (the end of the ninth week). All other fees and personal costs are not prorated and are non-refundable. No refunds are given for tuition, room or board under any circumstances of withdrawal or dismissal after the ninth week of a semester. Refunds are issued for partial drops only during the first 10 days of classes.
Refunds for tuition, room, and board for students who withdraw from their interterm classes will be prorated on a daily basis including weekends over the first 60% of the interterm. There will be no refunds given under any circumstances after 60% of the interterm has been completed.
Financial aid that is not earned (as a result of the prorated amount of time the student has been in school for the semester) will be forfeited. If a student has not earned all of the federal aid received to date at the point of withdrawal, funds will be repaid in the following order:
Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan
Federal Perkins Loan
PLUS Loan
Federal Pell Grant
Federal SEOG Grant
TEACH Grant
State Grant and Scholarship funds
Institutional aid
Outside Grant/Scholarships
If there is a student account balance resulting from these adjustments, the student is responsible for payment. Further details and examples can be obtained at Financial Aid/Student Accounts Office.
