Student Records and FERPA
Rights Under FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An “eligible student” under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution. “Education record” is defined as those records that contain information directly related to a student and which are maintained by an educational institution or party acting for the institution. These rights include:
The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days after the day American International College (the “College”) receives a request for access.
A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate school official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.
A student who wishes to ask the College to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants to be changed, and specify why it should be changed.
If the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. (For more information, see below).
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance Office
U.S. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20202
Student Education Records Disclosure Notice
The College will disclose personally identifiable information (PII) from students’ education records upon receipt of written consent. FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from students’ education records, without the consent of the student, if the disclosure meets certain conditions found in §99.31 the FERPA regulations.
Except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the student, FERPA regulations require the institution to record the disclosure. Eligible students have a right to inspect and review the record of such disclosures.
In compliance with FERPA regulations, the College may disclose PII from the education records without obtaining prior written consent of the student:
To other school officials within the College whom the College has determined to have legitimate educational interests.
A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the College who performs an institutional service of function for which the College would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the College with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the College.
Upon request, to officials of another school where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student’s enrollment or transfer.
To authorized representatives of the U. S. comptroller general, the U. S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education, or state and local educational authorities, such as a state postsecondary authority that is responsible for supervising the College’s state-supported education programs. Disclosures under this provision may be made in connection with an audit or evaluation of federal or state-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or compliance with federal legal requirements that relate to those programs. These entities may make further disclosures of PII to outside entities that are designated by them as their authorized representatives to conduct any audit, evaluation, or enforcement or compliance activity on their behalf.
In connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or which the student has received, if the information is necessary to determine eligibility for the aid, determine the amount of the aid, determine the conditions of the aid, or enforce the terms and conditions of the aid.
To organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of the College, in order to: (a) develop, validate, or administer predictive tests; (b) administer student aid programs; or (c) improve instruction.
To accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting functions.
To parents of an eligible student if the student is a dependent for IRS tax purposes.
To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, provided that reasonable notice is given to the student prior to compliance.
To appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency, subject to §99.36.
To a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense. The disclosure may only include the final results of the disciplinary proceeding with respect to that alleged crime or offense, regardless of the finding.
To the general public, the final results of a disciplinary proceeding, if the College determines the student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and the student has committed a violation of the College’s rules or policies with respect to the allegation made against him or her.
To parents of a student regarding the student’s violation of any federal, state, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the College, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the College determines the student committed a disciplinary violation and the student is under the age of 21.

The Disclosure of Student Information Related to Emergencies and Disasters
The purpose of this statement is to indicate that in situations related to a disaster or other health or safety emergencies, American International College will disclose non-directory information to appropriate parties in connection with an emergency, if knowledge of that information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. The guidelines set forth by the exception to FERPA’s general consent requirement will be followed. The release of health and safety information is only temporary and lasts the duration of the incident that necessitated the waiver. A copy of this policy may be obtained in the Course Catalog.

If it is determined that a violation of this policy has occurred, disciplinary action up to and including the dismissal of students and referral for prosecution may result. Applicable legal sanctions for the unlawful use, possession or distribution of alcohol and other drugs are summarized in the following section. This information appears here to meet the requirements of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. In addition to this policy, other College policies remain in effect.
Please see the separate document titled, “Statement on Drugs and Alcohol.”
I. Summary of Alcohol and Other Drug Laws
The legal drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 years of age. A person over 21 years of age may not buy alcohol for a person under 21 years of age, unless their relationship is that of parent and child or husband and wife, and even in those situations, liquor must be bought at a package liquor store, not a restaurant or tavern. Whoever furnishes any such beverage or alcohol for a person under 21 years of age shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both. Alcohol may not be purchased or attempted to be purchased by a person under 21 years of age. A person may not lie about his/her age to purchase alcohol, present false identification, or make arrangements with someone older to buy alcohol for him/her. Any person who knowingly makes a false statement as to the age of a person who is under 21 years of age in order to procure a sale or delivery of such beverages or alcohol to such person under 21 years of age, either for the use of the person under 21 years of age or for the use of some other person, and whoever induces a person under 21 years of age to make a false statement as to his age in order to procure a sale or delivery of such beverages or alcohol to such a person under twenty-one years of age, shall be punished by a fine of $300. Any person without a license to serve alcohol may not serve someone under 21 years of age, unless their relationship is that of parent and child or husband and wife. Any person who furnishes any such beverage or alcohol for a person under 21 years of age shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
Any person who transfers, alters, or defaces an identification card, or who makes, uses, carries, sells, or distributes a false identification card, or furnishes false information in obtaining such a card, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $200 or by imprisonment for not more than three months.
It is unlawful for a person under 21 years of age knowingly to drive a car with alcohol in it unless accompanied by a parent. To do so may result in a fine of up to $50 or suspension of the driver’s license for three months, or both. Persons may not drive while drinking from an open container of an alcoholic beverage. Violators shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $500. Persons may not drive while under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicating substance. Violators shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than two and one-half years, or both such fine and imprisonment. If a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe a person is driving under the influence, a breathalyzer test may be given. If the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or analysis, after having been informed that his license or permit to operate motor vehicles or right to operate motor vehicles in the Commonwealth shall be suspended for a period of at least 180 days and up to a lifetime loss, for such refusal, no such test or analysis shall be made and he shall have his license or right to operate suspended in accordance with this paragraph for a period of 180 days. Conviction for a first offense be punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500 or by imprisonment for not less than 30 days nor more than two years, or both, and for a second offense by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or in a house of correction for not less than 30 days nor more than two and one half years, or by a fine of not more than $1000, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
Massachusetts has criminal penalties for use of controlled substances, or drugs, with penalties varying with the type of drug. In general, narcotic, addictive, and drugs with a high potential for abuse have heavier penalties. Possession of drugs is illegal without valid authorization. While penalties for possession are generally not as great as for manufacture and distribution of drugs, possession of a relatively large quantity may be considered distribution. Under both State and Federal laws penalties for possession, manufacture and distribution are much greater for second and subsequent convictions. Many laws dictate mandatory prison terms and the full minimum term must be served. Massachusetts makes it illegal to be in a place where heroin is kept and to be “in the company” of a person known to possess heroin. Anyone in the presence of heroin at a private party or dormitory suite risks a serious drug conviction. Sale and possession of “drug paraphernalia” is illegal in Massachusetts. Under Federal law, distribution of drugs to persons under the age of 21 is punishable by twice the normal penalty with a mandatory one to three years in prison depending on the class of drugs; a third conviction is punishable by mandatory life imprisonment. These penalties apply to the distribution of drugs within 1,000 feet of a college or school. Federal law sets greatly heightened prison sentences for manufacture and distribution of drugs if death or serious injury results from the use of the substance.
The Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended suspends aid eligibility for students who have been convicted under federal or state law of the sale or possession of drugs, if the offense occurred during a period of enrollment for which the student was receiving federal student aid. For more information contact AIC’s Financial Aid Office or the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1.800.4.FED.AID (1.800.433.3243).
Please see the separate document titled “Statement on Drugs and Alcohol” and Section 8.
II. Notice of Federal Student Financial Aid Penalties for Drug Law Violations
A student who has been convicted of possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving federal Title IV financial aid loses eligibility for federal and state government financial aid (including Title IV, HEA grant, loan, or work-study assistance) for a period of time specified in the law (HEA Sec. 484(r)(1)); (20 U.S.C. 1091(r)(1)). The period of ineligibility depends on whether the conviction was for possession or sale of (including conspiring to sell) illegal drugs. For further information, please visit the College’s Financial Aid Office.
III. Delivery of Services
American International College assumes no liability for the delay or failure in providing educational or other services or facilities due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Causes include, but are not limited to power failure, fire, strikes by College employees or others, damage by natural elements, and acts of public authorities. The College will, however, exert reasonable efforts, when it judges them to be appropriate, to provide comparable services, facilities, or performance; but its inability or failure to do so shall not subject the College to liability.
American International College will endeavor to make available to its students a fine education and a stimulating and congenial environment. However, the quality and rate of progress of an individual’s academic career and professional advancement upon completion of a degree or program are largely dependent on his or her own abilities, commitment, and effort. In many professions and occupations, there are requirements imposed by federal and state statutes and regulatory agencies for certification or entry into a particular field. These requirements may change while a student is enrolled in a program and may vary from state to state or country to country. Although the College stands ready to help its students learn about requirements and changes in them, it is the student’s responsibility to initiate the inquiry.
