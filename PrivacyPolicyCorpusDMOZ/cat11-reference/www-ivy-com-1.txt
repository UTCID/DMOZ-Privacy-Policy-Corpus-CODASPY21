All Premium Services subscriptions are offered for a one-year period (“Subscription Period”).

If You choose the monthly payment option, You agree to pay the monthly Fees every month for the Subscription Period. Subscription Periods are automatically renewed as set forth in Section 11(b).

12. Limited Warranty.
(a) The Websites, Services (including the IvyCard and IvyCard Offers) and/or Content are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. It is Your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of the Content, and any information or other content available through the Websites and/or Services, together with other information available to You. Each of You and us represents and warrants that it has the legal power to enter into this Agreement. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 12, WE PROVIDE NO OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON–INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, ALWAYS AVAILABLE, ERROR-FREE OR WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR, AND NO WARRANTY IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO, THE CONNECTIVITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THE WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES.
(b) WE DO NOT: (i) GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR USEFULNESS OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED OR POSTED ON THE WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, OR (ii) ADOPT, ENDORSE OR ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY OPINION, ADVICE, OR STATEMENT MADE BY ANY PARTY OTHER THAN US. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ANYONE’S RELIANCE ON INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT POSTED ON THE WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, POSTED BY ANY USERS, OR TRANSMITTED TO OR BY ANY USERS.
13. Limitation on Liability.
(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL IVY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR COSTS OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE WEBSITES, SERVICES, CONTENT, OR ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL POSTED BY USERS, THE IVYCARD, THE IVYCARD OFFERS, OR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL IVY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED (I) IF YOU ARE A PAYING SUBSCRIBER, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO IVY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING ANY CLAIM, OR (II) IF YOU ARE NOT A PAYING SUBSCRIBER, ONE HUNDRED ($100) U.S. DOLLARS. THIS LIMITATION IS CUMULATIVE AND NOT PER CLAIM.
14. Indemnity.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless IVY, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and representatives from any and all third-party claims, losses, liability, damages and/or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising from Your use of the Websites, Services, Content, any information and/or content posted by You or using Your Login Credentials through the Websites and/or Services, Your violation of this Agreement, and Your infringement, or infringement by any other user of Your accounts, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.
15. Geographic Limitations.
You will only use the Websites and Services in a manner consistent with this Agreement and any and all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, United States export control laws. You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country which the United States has (i) embargoed goods, (ii) identified as a “Specially Designated National”, or (iii) placed on the Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders. Registration for, and use of, the Websites and/or Services are void where prohibited. To the extent that the Services are not legal in Your jurisdiction, You may not use the Services. The Websites and/or Services may not be used where prohibited by law.
16. Arbitration.
You and IVY agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services, including the Websites, user interfaces, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to this Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and IVY are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your IVY membership. Any arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. Unless IVY and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in New York. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. YOU AND IVY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and IVY agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void and in such event, you and IVY agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services, including the Websites, user interfaces, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, shall be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York, NY.
17. Miscellaneous.
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of law where such principles would permit the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. You and IVY acknowledge and agree that this Agreement relates solely to the performance of services (not the sale of goods) and, accordingly, will not be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code of any state having jurisdiction and shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party is authorized to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of, or in the name of, the other or to bind the other in any manner. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or Your rights and obligations hereunder without IVY’s prior written consent. IVY may freely assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder. IVY retains ownership of all intellectual property rights to its Content, technology, software, documentation and tools used in connection with the Websites, Services and/or Content. Notices delivered under this Agreement must be given in writing and will be effective when received. This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any additional terms and conditions and any written agreement between You and IVY, contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions and matters contemplated hereby, supersedes all previous communications, understandings and agreements (whether oral or written), and cannot be amended except by a writing signed by both parties or by notice to You by IVY via e-mail or to Your account on the Services. The headings and captions used in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement. If any part of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
18. Digital Millennium Copyright Notice Act.
If You believe that Your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible on the Websites, please notify IVY’s copyright agent, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). For Your complaint to be valid under the DMCA, You must provide the following information in writing:
1. An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work that You claim is being infringed;
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Site;
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit IVY to contact You, such as Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
5. A statement that You have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
6. A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that You are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.
