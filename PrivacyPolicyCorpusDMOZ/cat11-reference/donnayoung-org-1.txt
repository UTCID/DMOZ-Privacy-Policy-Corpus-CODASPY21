As Few Cookies as Possible
DonnaYoung.org does NOT implement social sharing scripts, many of which track you and benefit
neither you nor me.
DonnaYoung.org does NOT implement any type of FaceBook, Twitter, or Pinterest widget. If I do link to my social connections they will be plain links requiring no scripts.
The "at DonnaYoung.org" Links
The links at donnayoung.org that have a header worded something like "at DonnaYoung.org" or "Related at DonnaYoung.org" are links to somewhere on this website (donnayoung.org). Not all of the DonnaYoung.org links will have the "at DonnaYoung.org" header. DonnaYoung.org is a big web site and Donna Young hopes that the "at DonnaYoung.org" links are useful.
These links are simple links, meaning they do not track nor do they set cookies. They are laboriously provided for your benefit.
Links to Other Web sites, Off Site Links
Donnayoung.org
rarely contains links to other web sites of interest. Links are live and true on the day that they are linked, however; links can become broken
and they can point to content that is different from the original content. Donna Young is not informed when others change their websites.
Once you use an off-site link and
leave donnayoung.org, you should
note that Donna Young does not have any control over that other web site.
Therefore, Donna Young cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of
any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such
sites that are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise
caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the web site in
question.
Unusual or Unexpected Advertising
Donna Young runs a clean website and no longer uses 3rd party ads. If you see
adult-only ads or experience pop-up or pop-under ads on this website please check your computer for malware or adware.

Donna Young has not reviewed every home school book that she has used.
Donna Young might link the reviewed book with an "affiliated link" if such a link is available; otherwise, a plain link will be used or no link.
Donna Young does not review books by request.
