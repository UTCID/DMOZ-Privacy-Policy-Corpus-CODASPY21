MOSD ALUMNI ARE OUR HEARING HEROES!
Since 1959 MOSD has helped equip students with spoken language skills so that they may enter the mainstream setting with hearing peers. Many former students are leading independent lives with limitless opportunities in their futures! Now, our alumni are giving back!
Take a look at our former students who are giving monthly gifts in order to support current students in their journey to learning spoken language!
THANK YOU TO OUR "HEARING HEROES!"

Sponsorship gives children the gift of brighter futures – one child at a time.
MOSD alumni are making a noticeable impact each month by sponsoring students currently enrolled at Memphis Oral School for the Deaf. We are so proud of the ways our former students continue to strive to reach individual goals and the heart they have to give back to younger children. Thank you for being great examples and for your financial gifts that provide limitless opportunities for others.
Monthly donations help cover costs such as specialized spoken language instruction in the classroom, daily aural habilitation (listening therapy), daily speech therapy, and audiological support. A monthly commitment to pay for part of these unique services makes a profound impact on a child learning listening and spoken language skills needed to mainstream into kindergarten.
If you are interested in making a monthly commitment  to help these children learn to listen and talk, prepare them to enter mainstream kindergarten with their hearing classmates and lead an independent life, click below to get started!

THE VALUE OF HEARING EVERYTHING AND HAVING A VOICE IS PRICELESS!
