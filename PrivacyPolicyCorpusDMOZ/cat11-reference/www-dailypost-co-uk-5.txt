Chilly Cow ice cream, based in the Vale of Clwyd, set up a portable freezer and an honesty box at Stryt Fawr farm, Llanychan, near Ruthin. During the spring and summer as many as 150 walkers and cyclists dipped into the freezer each day, helping to keep the business afloat during the dark days of lockdown. It meant a planned expansion is now very much back on the agenda: a 20ft shipping container has been brought in to provide space for product packaging instead of a cramped spare bedroom that doubled as an office. It was sourced from Denbigh’sContainer Sales Centre (CSC), whose multi-sized units are finding a myriad of uses – from housing a flight simulator to an indoor coffee bar. Anna Taylor, who set up Chilly Cow six years ago at the organic dairy farm her husband David runs with his parents, said the honesty box had been a “real godsend”.
“We had 33 summer events in the diary, from shows to weddings, and they were all cancelled,” she said. “We thought we’d give the honesty box a go and it’s been amazing how it has taken off. “With so many people on furlough and children off school, a lot of families have been out and about.”

Only 3% of Stryt Fawr’s milk – sourced from the farm’s 90 Brown Swiss cows – is made into Chilly Cow ice cream. Most of the rest is bought up by fast food giant McDonald’s for its children’s range of Happy Meals.
A small tub of ice cream is just £2 and, according to David, it proved a useful tactic for parents wanting to get kids out into the countryside. He said: “Sometimes you’re here in the farmyard and you can hear the kids saying, “Are we there yet?” “There’s even a handy little seat just down the lane by Llanychan Church and some days there’s a queue to sit there.” During lockdown Chilly Cow kept supplying local stores, butchers and farm shops. Once cafes and restaurants re-opened, the wholesale side of the business picked up again, prompting the need for more storage.  This problem was solved by CSC, which supplies 8ft high shipping containers ranging from 20ft to 40ft in length. New units costing up to £4,000 are watertight and, as they can be insulated, are popular as offices. The company also supplies used containers in various states of repair from as little as £350.

CSC sales consultant Lisa James said the containers can be put to a range of uses. “We offer the full range from brand new to used ones and buyers can fit them out to their own bespoke requirements. “Buyers they can do whatever they like within the space,” she said. “Some people insulate them and even fit windows to use them as an office. Others just want them as a simple and safe storage facility. “You can also paint the exterior to your own taste, including having your company branding.”northwalesliveFollow @northwalesliveMore OnDenbighRuthinFarmingNorth Wales Food and DrinkFoodDenbighshire
