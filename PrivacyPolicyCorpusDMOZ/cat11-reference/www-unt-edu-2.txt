Privacy Statement Requirements
Privacy Policy
(Excerpted from the web Publishing Policy)
All UNT web sites must provide a privacy statement on their top-level web
page (also called home or index pages). Each privacy statement must identify the information collected from site visitors, describe its use, and assure site visitors of the integrity of their information during transmission and storage.
Privacy Notice
Each privacy statement must identify both passive and active information
collected from site visitors and describe its use. Passive information is collected without alerting the site visitor. Active information is purposely provided by the site visitor.
Examples of passive information include:
browser detection: browser type and browser version
remote host name: the DNS entry for the computer accessing the web site
cookies: hidden identifiers used to store data during a visit, and cumulatively over time
Examples of active information include:
name of the site visitor
e-mail address of the site visitor
comments or answers to questions provided by the site visitor
Security of Private Information
Each
web site at UNT will assure site visitors of the integrity of their
information, in transit and in storage. This assurance should include
whether or not the data is encrypted in transit via Secure Socket Layers (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS), the positions or UNT
employees that will be able to access the information, and under what
conditions that information will be accessed.
Because
the university has special responsibilities to protect students'
information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, any
university web site collecting data falling under FERPA guidelines must
carefully review its handling of such data and insure that its
procedures adhere to the act.

Students
and instructors that log in to Blackboard Vista classes have more detailed
records. Once logged in with a Blackboard Vista User ID, the browser, browser
version, remote host and Blackboard Vista User ID will be tracked throughout Blackboard Vista
class activities. All actions taken by that Blackboard Vista User ID in a Blackboard Vista
class are logged and accessible by the Blackboard Vista Course instructor and the
Blackboard Vista System Administrator (at the request of the Blackboard Vista Course
instructor or in the course of diagnosing a technical difficulty).
Blackboard Vista courses are archived once a semester on the day after grades are
due. These archives are kept on tape backup for at least five years. Blackboard Vista course archives are accessible by the Blackboard Vista System Administrator,
and will be accessed only in the event of a request from the instructor
of that course or governing body of the university, or in the course of
diagnosing a technical difficulty.
