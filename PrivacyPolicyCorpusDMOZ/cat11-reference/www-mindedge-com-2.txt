5. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MindEdge from and against all liability, claims, actions and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of your use of the Platform or your breach or alleged breach of any term, condition, obligation, representation or warranty in these Terms.

6. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
You and MindEdge agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section). A sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules will handle our arbitration. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and MindEdge are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
7. OTHER
You agree that the Platform shall be deemed a passive interactive service based solely in Massachusetts and shall not give rise to personal jurisdiction over MindEdge, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Massachusetts. These Terms of Service shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law principles. You agree that any legal action or proceeding between MindEdge and you for any purpose concerning these Terms of Service or your use of the Platform shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.
Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to any of the foregoing matters must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is barred.
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and MindEdge concerning the Platform and the services provided by MindEdge. If any provision of any such document is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions thereof, which shall remain in full force and effect. MindEdge’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Service. MindEdge may assign its rights and duties under these Terms of Service to any party at any time without notice to you.
Most communication between MindEdge and you will be sent and received electronically. You agree that all electronic communication between MindEdge and you shall satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in writing.
Any rights of MindEdge not expressly granted herein are reserved.
