The Policy guides how we collect, store and use information about our members, and it will be periodically assessed against new technologies, business practices and the changing needs of our members.
TheEducatorsNetwork.com may, from time to time, modify this Customer Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. In that event the changes will appear at this location.
Our Policy recognizes that personal data deserves the highest level of protection. Personally-Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail addresses, names and addresses of members, and "click stream" data that tracks user activity on a Web site or online service.

Please be aware that if you disclose Personally-Identifiable Information on a Website message boards or chat areas, that information may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of TheEducatorsNetwork.com.
Notification. members will be notified (usually at the point where Personally-Identifiable Information is collected) as to the uses the business unit may make of the Personally-Identifiable Information collected from them.

However, sharing Personally-Identifiable Information with an entity working on behalf of TheEducatorsNetwork.com or transferring Personally-Identifiable Information in conjunction with the sale or similar transfer of a business unit is considered an Onward Transfer and will be handled as described below.

Access: Review and correction. Procedures have been developed through which members can, upon request, review and correct the Personally-Identifiable Information that has been collected from them by TheEducatorsNetwork.com. These procedures may not, however, compromise the security, integrity and privacy of either TheEducatorsNetwork.com's own proprietary databases or databases licensed from third party companies.
Onward Transfer. Whenever TheEducatorsNetwork.com permits a third party outside of TheEducatorsNetwork.com to access Personally-Identifiable Information through either External Distribution or Onward Transfer, commercially appropriate procedures will be followed to help ensure that the Information is used only for authorized purposes and by authorized persons in a manner consistent with the choices members have made under this Policy, and that the security, integrity and privacy of the information is maintained.
