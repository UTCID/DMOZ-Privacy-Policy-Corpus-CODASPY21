Privacy
Overview
Data is at the core of many of today’s innovations, but often the data used is highly personal or sensitive. My research aims to develop and deploy algorithms and technologies that enable data-driven innovations while preserving privacy. To that end, I study how the data-mining techniques commonly used in the context of the web and social applications have to be changed so that they preserve the rigorous privacy guarantee of differential privacy while remaining useful, and demonstrate how quantitative analyses and machine learning techniques can identify novel privacy risks and support development of tools to empower companies, governments, and individuals to protect privacy.
