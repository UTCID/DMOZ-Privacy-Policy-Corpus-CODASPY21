Information gathering
For every visitor to this website, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain. We also collect information volunteered by visitors to this website, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website by identifying which parts of our site are most heavily used.
Our staff occasionally monitors search terms that users enter into the Project Zero search engine but this tracking is never associated with individual users.
Use of information
Our staff uses the information gathered as discussed above to tailor site content to user needs, and to generate aggregate statistical reports. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis and then deleted completely from our systems.
The information we collect is not shared with or sold to other commercial or other nonprofit organizations. If you supply us with your postal or e-mail addresses online, you will receive mailings only from Project Zero or Harvard Graduate School of Education.
