Student Right to KnowPolicies and ResourcesThe Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 requires universities to make available to current and prospective students important information concerning each institution’s academic programs, retention rates, graduation rates, crime reports, financial aid procedures and more in an effort to ensure fairness and transparency for all higher education consumers.
Trine's goal is that this effort, by the University and the Department of Education, to provide data will enable prospective students to make the best college decision for them and their future.
For additional information about Trine University, please see the College Navigator website maintained by the U.S. Department of Education, in which you can compare Trine to more than 7,000 higher learning institutions across the United States.
