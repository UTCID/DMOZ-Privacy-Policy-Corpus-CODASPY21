Privacy Statement
HGSE Website Privacy Statement
Our web server logs automatically record certain information about your visit to the website, including your IP address, information about your browser and device, and your travels on the site. We also collect information volunteered by visitors to this website, such as, but not limited to, survey information and/or site registrations.
Our staff occasionally monitors search terms that users enter into the Harvard search engine, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.
Use of Information
We use information in the web server logs to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the Harvard network.
We may also tie your IP address and information about your browser to information you have volunteered. The information we collect may be disclosed to perform marketing, promotions, and advertising, either directly or through third parties.
Our staff and contracted third parties use the information gathered as discussed above to tailor site content to user needs, inform and optimize marketing campaigns, and to generate aggregate statistical reports. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis and then deleted completely from our systems, but we may retain information pulled from server logs and combined to your volunteered information for a longer time. We prohibit our contracted third parties from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services to us or our users.
We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect our rights and safety and the rights and safety of our users or others.
Except as described above, the information we collect is not shared with or sold to other commercial or other nonprofit organizations. If you supply us with your postal or e-mail addresses online, you will receive mailings only from Harvard University. If you do not wish to continue receiving such mailings, please let us know by sending an e-mail to us.
