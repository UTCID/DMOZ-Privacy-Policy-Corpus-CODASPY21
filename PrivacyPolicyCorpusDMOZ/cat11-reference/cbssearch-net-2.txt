1. Definitions.
“CBSSEARCH.NET” is an online service operated by ASL MARKETING, LLC (“ASL”) on the World Wide Web of the Internet, consisting of certain services and content provided by ASL, its parent, affiliated and subsidiary companies and third parties.
2. General.
(A) This End User Agreement (the “Agreement”), sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to use of CBSSEARCH.NET by each end user thereof (“End User”). By using CBSSEARCH.NET (other than to read this Agreement for the first time), End User agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to use CBSSEARCH.NET is personal to End User and is not transferable to any other person or entity. End User shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of End User’s password(s), if any. End User shall be fully responsible for the use of CBSSEARCH.NET by any other person it permits to access CBSSEARCH.NET.
(B) ASL shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of CBSSEARCH.NET, including, but not limited to, content, hours of availability, and equipment needed for access or use.
3. Changed Terms.
ASL shall have the right at any time to change or modify the terms and conditions applicable to End User’s use of CBSSEARCH.NET, or any part thereof, or to impose new conditions, including, but not limited to, requiring user registration, adding fees and charges for use. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, posting on CBSSEARCH.NET, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means by which End User obtains notice thereof. Any use of CBSSEARCH.NET by End User after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by End User of such changes, modifications or additions, unless the End User notifies ASL in writing that it has terminated this Agreement within five (5) business days of receipt by the End User of such notice, in which case the End User’s conduct shall be deemed governed by the Agreement without such changes, modifications or additions.
4. Equipment.
End User shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telephone, computer hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of CBSSEARCH.NET and all charges related thereto.
5. End User Conduct.
(A) End User shall use CBSSEARCH.NET for non-commercial, lawful purposes only. End User shall not post or transmit through CBSSEARCH.NET any material which violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others, which is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability or otherwise violates any law, or which, without ASL’s express prior approval, contains advertising or any solicitation with respect to products or services. Any conduct by an End User that in ASL’s discretion restricts or inhibits any other End User from using or enjoying CBSSEARCH.NET will not be permitted. Without limiting the foregoing, prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to, (1) distribution of unsolicited chain letters, (2) propagation of computer worms, viruses and other such malicious code, (3) using (directly or indirectly) CBSSEARCH.NET or its computer network to make unauthorized entry to any other machine accessible via CBSSEARCH.NET or its computer network and (4) use of CBSSEARCH.NET to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation, including, but not limited to, the solicitation of users of CBSSEARCH.NET to become users of other on-line services competitive with CBSSEARCH.NET. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of ASL, violations of the foregoing may result in removal of violative communications and/or early termination of the End User’s access to CBSSEARCH.NET.
(B) CBSSEARCH.NET contains copyrighted material, trademarks and other proprietary information that may include, but is not limited to, text, software, photos, video, graphics, music and sound, and the entire contents of CBSSEARCH.NET are copyrighted as a collective work under the United States copyright laws. ASL, as between itself and End User, owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement of such content, as well as in the content original to it. End User may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit, any of the content, in whole or in part. Except as otherwise expressly permitted under copyright law, no copying, redistribution, retransmission, publication or commercial or non-commercial exploitation of downloaded material will be permitted without the express permission of ASL and the copyright owner. In the event of any permitted copying, redistribution or publication of copyrighted material, no changes in or deletion of author attribution, trademark legend or copyright notice shall be made. End User acknowledges that it does not acquire any ownership rights by accessing or otherwise using copyrighted material.
(C) End User shall not upload, post or otherwise make available on CBSSEARCH.NET any material protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right and the burden of determining that any material is not protected by copyright rests with End User. End User shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm resulting from such a submission. By submitting material to any public area of CBSSEARCH.NET, End User automatically grants, or warrants that the owner of such material has expressly granted ASL the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, edit and distribute such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material. End User also permits any other End User to access, view, store or reproduce the material for that End User’s personal use. Please note that ASL does not want to receive confidential information from any End User and any information received will be deemed NOT to be confidential.
(D) From time to time, CBSSEARCH.NET may, at its sole discretion, allow End User to submit certain content including, but not limited to, photos, messages, notes, text, information, music, video, advertisements, listings, or other content (collectively, “User Content”) and make available such User Content on CBSSEARCH.NET. End User understands that, regardless of whether or not such User Content is published or otherwise made available on CBSSEARCH.NET, ASL in no way guarantees any confidentiality with respect to any User Content.
End User is solely responsible for any User Content that End User End uploads, transmits, shares, publishes or displays (collectively and hereinafter, “Post”) on or through CBSSEARCH.NET, or transmits to or shares with other End Users. End User is and shall be at all times solely responsible for its own User Content and the consequences of Posting such User Content and affirms, represents, and warrants that End User owns, or has the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize ASL to use, all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or any other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in any manner contemplated by ASL and these Terms of Use. End User may not Post User Content on CBSSEARCH.NET that End User did not create or that End User does not have permission to Post. End User understands and agrees that ASL may, but is in no way obligated to, review CBSSEARCH.NET and/or any User Content and may delete or remove (without notice) any User Content in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including User Content that in the sole judgment of ASL violates this Terms or Use, or which might be considered offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of users or others. End User is solely responsible, at End User sole cost and expense, for creating any backup copies or replacing any User Content End User Posts on CBSSEARCH.NET.
In posting User Content to CBSSEARCH.NET, End User authorizes and directs ASL to make such copies thereof as it deems necessary in order to facilitate the Posting and storage of the User Content on CBSSEARCH.NET and End User automatically grants, and End User represents and warrants that End User has the right to grant, to ASL an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, royalty-free worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, on or in connection with CBSSEARCH.NET or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing. End User may remove User Content from CBSSEARCH.NET at any time; however, End User expressly acknowledges that ASL may retain archived copies of User Content. The Site does not assert any ownership over such User Content; rather, as between ASL and End User, subject to the rights granted to ASL in these Terms of Use, End User retains full ownership of all of User Content and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with User Content.
End User further agree that End User will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless End User is the owner of such rights or has permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant CBSSEARCH.NET all of the license rights granted herein.
End User understands and agrees that CBSSEARCH.NET does not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and CBSSEARCH.NET expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content.
(E) The foregoing provisions of Section 5 are for the benefit of ASL, ASL parent and affiliated companies and its client companies, third party content providers and licensors and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.

10. Trademarks.
Trademarks appearing on CBSSEARCH.NET are the property of ASL, affiliates of ASL, or their respective owners.
11. Third Party Content.
ASL is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and End Users. Accordingly, ASL has no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers, End Users or any other user of CBSSEARCH.NET, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of ASL. Neither ASL nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to Section 6 above for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.) In many instances, the content available through CBSSEARCH.NET represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, End User, or other user not under contract with ASL. ASL and the ASL PARTIES neither endorse nor are responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on CBSSEARCH.NET. Under no circumstances will ASL or the ASL PARTIES be liable for any loss or damage caused by an End User’s reliance on information obtained through CBSSEARCH.NET. It is the responsibility of End User to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other content available through CBSSEARCH.NET.
12. Miscellaneous.
This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of CBSSEARCH.NET, including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained in CBSSEARCH.NET and any operating rules for CBSSEARCH.NET established by ASL) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, and the unenforceability of any one or more provisions will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions. In addition, if any provision of the Agreement, for any reason, is declared to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable law, preserves the original intentions and economic positions of the parties. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.
13. Privacy Policy.
ASL knows that the privacy of End User’s personal information is important to End User. Therefore, ASL has established a Privacy Policy governing the use of this information, which is located at here and is part of this Agreement.
14. DMCA Notice.
(A) ASL owns, protects and enforces copyrights in its own creative material and respects the copyright properties of others. Materials may be made available on or via CBSSEARCH.NET by third parties not within the control of ASL. It is our policy not to permit materials known by us to be infringing to remain on this site. If End User is a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Content, or other content, infringes upon End User’s copyrights, End User may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, as amended (the “DMCA”) by providing us with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): (i) the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (iii) identification of the User Content, or other content, that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact End User, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the User Content, or other content, in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that End User is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Pursuant to the DMCA 17 U.S.C. 512 (c), ASL has designated the Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Alloy, Inc. as its agent (“Agent”) for notification of claims of copyright infringement with respect to information residing, at the direction of a user, on the CBSSEARCH.NET Web site. The Agent contact information is: www.CBSSEARCH.NET, c/o Alloy Digital LLC, Attn: Chief Legal Officer/ General Counsel, 151 W. 26th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10001, email: legal@cbssearch.net
For purposes of clarification, solely DMCA notices should go to the Agent; all other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed as set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. End User expressly acknowledges that if End User fails to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 14, End User’s DMCA notice may not be valid.
(B) If End User believes that End User’s User Content, or other content, that has been removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that End User has authorization from the actual copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to law, to submit, post and make use of such User Content, or other content, End User may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Agent: (i) End User’s physical or electronic signature; (ii) identification of the User Content, or other content, that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content, or other content appeared on CBSSEARCH.NET prior to the point at which such User Content, or other content, was removed or disabled; (iii) a statement that End User has a good faith belief that the User Content, or other content, was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content, or other content; and (iv) End User’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address, a statement that End User consents to the jurisdiction of the federal court in New York, New York, and a statement that End User will accept service of process from the party that provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by the Agent, CBSSEARCH.NET may send a copy of such counter-notice to the original complaining party informing such party that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at CBSSEARCH.NET’s sole discretion.
(C) CBSSEARCH.NET suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Please also be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
