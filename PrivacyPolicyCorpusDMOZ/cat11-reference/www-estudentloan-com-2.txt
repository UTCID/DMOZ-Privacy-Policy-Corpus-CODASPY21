In determining liability and/or awarding damages or other relief, the arbitrator will follow the applicable substantive law (consistent with these terms of use and the FAA) that would apply if the matter had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any damages or other relief or remedies permitted by applicable law. The arbitrator will write a brief explanation of the grounds for the decision. A judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.For any Disputes that total less than $75,000.00 and at your written request, Unigo will pay all filing, hearing and other fees that JAMS or the arbitrator charge you for the Dispute to the extent that those fees exceed the lesser fee, if any, for filing a claim in state or federal court in the judicial district in which you reside. If you file a claim in state or federal court prior to initiating arbitration, you will not be required to pay any fees for arbitration if the dispute totals less than $75,000 and you submit a written request to Unigo to pay the fees. JAMS may allow you to seek a waiver of any fees for the arbitration. We will always pay any fees or expenses that are required to enforce this Arbitration Clause or that the law or JAMS’s rules require us to pay.You acknowledge that participating in arbitration may result in limited discovery. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will, if requested, take reasonable steps to protect your personal information and our information from disclosure outside of the arbitration proceeding.If any portion of this Arbitration Clause (other than the class action waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed from this Arbitration Clause, and the remainder of the Arbitration Clause will be given full force and effect.
