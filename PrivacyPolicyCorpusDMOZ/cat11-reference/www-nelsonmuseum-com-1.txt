PRIVACY POLICY
Nelson Museum values your privacy. We treat your personal information with the highest standards of security and confidentiality.
Nelson Museum does not collect any personal information without your knowledge. We don't sell, rent, or give your personal information to unrelated third parties without your prior permission.
Each time a visitor comes to Nelson Museum, information is collected to help us improve the overall experience of our site. This information allows us to determine which areas of the site are used more frequently than others, how certain features of the site are used, and how users make the most of the content available. We collect visitor domain names or IP addresss (e.g., whether the user is logged on from netscape.com or yale.edu or 255.255.255.0), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to Nelson Museum), and browser/platform types (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
Likewise, Nelson Museum also counts, tracks, and aggregates visitor activity into our analysis of general traffic flow (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from and how traffic flows within the site). Nelson Museum may merge this information into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with potential advertisers, research firms, and business partners. However, Nelson Museum will never disclose your individual identity or personal data. If Nelson Museum presents any aggregated information to potential advertisers, research firms, and business partners, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
Nelson Museum never shares, sells, or rents any personal information without your permission, unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you e-mails based on your request for information.
