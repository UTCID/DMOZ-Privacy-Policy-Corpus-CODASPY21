Introduction
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Health Sciences uses Google Analytics to collect information about our website users.
Personal data we collect
We have certain features in Google Analytics enabled that allow us to collect personal data about our website users. The enabled features provide information about the age and gender of our users, along with the interests they express in their online purchasing activities. We also collect location information (country and city).
The data we collect is aggregated, so there is no personally identifiable information available to us.
We do not share data with any third party.
What we use the data for
We use the data to guide us in increasing our student enrollment. For example, information in the location data may indicate that we should begin marketing to, or market better to, prospective students in the Pacific Northwest.
Opt-out
You can opt-out of the data collection on our website, or any other website using Google Analytics, by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
