Office of HIPAA Privacy
Overview
At Nova Southeastern University (“NSU”), we are committed to protecting the confidentiality of health information and in complying with Federal and state regulations regarding protected health information. The standards for protecting patient health information are described in the Federal law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This website provides information and guidance on the policies and procedures related to HIPAA Privacy compliance at NSU.
The NSU Office of HIPAA Privacy works with members of our workforce including faculty, staff, and students to help them understand their responsibilities.  We do this through policy and procedure, training, and monitoring.  Additionally, each NSU health care center, department and business unit that conducts covered functions such that they are designated in the Health Care Component (HCC) of the NSU Hybrid Entity has identified an individual to act as the HIPAA Liaison to assist with ongoing HIPAA Privacy compliance.
HIPAA Liaisons are designated by each HCC to work with the Office of HIPAA Privacy on policy and procedural issues. The HIPAA Liaisons may also receive requests from patients including but not limited to access, amendment, appeals and accountings of disclosures regarding their PHI. (See, the List of HIPAA Liaisons located on this website).
If you have a HIPAA Privacy question or concern, please call either the HIPAA Information Security Hotline at 954-262-0448, your designated HIPAA Liaison, or the NSU Ethics and Compliance Reporting Hotline at 888-609-NOVA (6682), if you wish to remain anonymous.
