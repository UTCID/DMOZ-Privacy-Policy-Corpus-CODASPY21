Plans and policies
Keele University is committed to managing water use efficiently whilst also ensuring robust plans are in place to minimise the risk of pollution from water related activities. As such we implemented our first Water Management Plan in 2019 and have seen water consumption in the 19/20 academic year reduce by 20% year on year.
The Keele University campus is similar to a small city. As such, we look after a vast network of privately owned utilities including more than 16km of mains water pipes. We provide water for Halls of Residence, Staff Flats and Housing, Academic and Central Services Buildings, including laboratories, and the Science Park buildings.
During the 2018/19 academic year Keele University campus consumed 332,336m3 of water (That’s 330 million litres!).
