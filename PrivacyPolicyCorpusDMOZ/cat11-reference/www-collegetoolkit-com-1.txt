6. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Edvisors responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the DMCA (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further information). To file a notice of infringement you must provide a written communication that sets forth the items specified below. You may be liable for damages (including damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that the Websites, a web page or any content on the Websites is infringing your copyright. As such, before submitting a DMCA notice, it’s important to consider if the manner in which the material is used falls under the doctrine of fair use. If you are not sure whether material located on a Edvisors site infringes your copyright, or if it is subject to fair use protections, you should first consider seeking legal advice.
A. Notification. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other Edvisors content infringes upon your copyright, you may submit a written notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our Copyright Agent (listed below) with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that I allegedly infringed; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by the notification, a representative list of such works on or in the Services: (iii) a description of the location on the Services or Websites of the allegedly infringed material(s); (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material(s) in the matter complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a written statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Edvisors’ designated Copyright Agent for notice of claims of infringement is:
Compliance Department
College Loan Corporation

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the notice requirements of the DMCA, your notice may not be valid.
B. Termination of Repeat Offenders. In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Edvisors shall, in appropriate circumstances, terminate access, at Edvisors’ sole discretion, of any general user or Member that Edvisors finds to be a repeat infringer of other copyrights.

19. Arbitration: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS
A. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting Edvisors at info@edvisors.com. In the event that we cannot resolve your concern, binding arbitration through the following procedures shall be your sole and exclusive remedy. Any arbitration under these Terms of Use will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
B. Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, Edvisors and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, regardless of legal theory, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising and claims relating to any and all use of the Service(s), whether brought during or after the term of these Terms of Use. References to “Edvisors,” “you,” and “us” include our respective corporate subsidiaries and parents, affiliates, agents, employees, officers, directors, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under these Terms of Use or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.
You agree that, by accepting these Terms of Use, you and Edvisors are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Section 19 shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.
C. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Edvisors shall be addressed to Edvisors Network, Inc., 10000 W. Charleston Blvd., Suite 200, Las Vegas, NV 89135, Attention: President (“Edvisors Notice Address”). The Notice to you shall be addressed to any such addresses, including email addresses you may have provided Edvisors. If you have never provided Edvisors with any such address, Edvisors will, after using due diligence to discover, send Notice to your last known mailing address. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Demand must be made within a reasonable time after a dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the claim or facts forming the basis of the dispute. If Edvisors and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim informally within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Edvisors may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Edvisors or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Edvisors is entitled.
D. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must issue a written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which an award is based. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provisions in this Section 19 are for a court to decide. Unless Edvisors and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Clark County, Nevada. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator unless otherwise directed by the AAA Rules. Each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Arbitration fees will be allocated in accordance with the AAA Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator, if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes only in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
E. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief to the extent it affects conduct between a party and a non-party. YOU AND EDVISORS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING SUCH AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR MASS JOINDER PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Edvisors agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
F. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if Edvisors makes any material change to this Section 19 (other than a change to the Edvisors Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, to the Edvisors Notice Address, within 30 days of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of these Terms of Use in the form prior to such rejected change.
20. Compliance with FTC Guidelines on Endorsements/Testimonials
If you choose to promote our services to the public, including your own personal social networks, you agree that you will comply with the FTC's Guidelines Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising ("Guidelines").
21. Jurisdiction
These Terms of Use and any dispute of any kind that arises with Edvisors shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws. You further agree to irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Clark County, Nevada.
22. Entire Agreement
These Terms of Use together with any other terms and conditions or policies that incorporate these Terms of Use by reference, constitutes the complete, final and exclusive understanding between Edvisors and you relating to the subject matter hereof and governs your use of the Service(s), superseding all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements and/or communications with respect to such subject matter. You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you obtain or use third-party content, third-party software or goods and services provided by or through Clients, Sponsors, Reward Partners, Affiliates or other third-parties.
23. Assignment
These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Edvisors without restriction.
24. Invalidity; Waiver
If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. It is the parties’ intention that the court modify such invalid provision to give it the fullest effect permissible under applicable law. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Edvisors’ failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
25. Termination
A Member may terminate their membership in any of the Registered Services with or without cause at any time. A Member’s termination of Registered Services is effective upon Member’s terminating his/her membership on the Service’s Website. A visitor to any Edvisors Website who is not a Member but who does not agree to any of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use should not use any of the Services and should exit the Website immediately.
Edvisors may terminate membership and use of any of the Registered Services and may remove User Submissions in its sole discretion, effective immediately and without prior notice, for any reason, including, without limitation, failure to provide accurate Registration Data; lack of use; or if Edvisors believes that Member or has violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.
Upon termination by either you or Edvisors: (i) Edvisors may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services: (ii) your rights to use the Service(s) ceases immediately, including any rights to contests, games, or activities active at the time of termination; (iii) should you object to any of these Terms of Use or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.

C. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
We use tracking technologies to help provide content, to measure promotional effectiveness, to offer advertisements and/or other offerings, to recognize you and your preferences when you return to our site, to help us learn more about how our users use our sites, to personalize your experience, to assess which areas of our site you visit, and to remarket to you after you leave our site.
Third Party Tracking: We permit third parties that we have agreements with us to track you when you are on our web site. When you leave our web site there is a chance that these third parties may continue to track you.
A few tracking technologies include, without limitation, images, scripts and subsequent technology and methods later developed:
Cookies: Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user and help store your preferences and activity. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors Site.
Web Beacons: Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming which may be included in our services. Web beacons can be invisible to you and are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate our Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many specific articles or links were actually viewed.
HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects: Similar to cookies are “locally stored objects” which we may also use for storing analytics information. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.
Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies: Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This web site also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, and the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information. By using this web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by a third-party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
For some of our products, we use Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations, and Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting.
These features use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) for connecting the tracking activity performed by Google Analytics and its cookies with the Adwords advertising network and the DoubleClick cookie (a third party cookie). The use of these cookies allows us to optimize the delivery of ad content specifically targeted to a visitor’s interests based upon previous visits to our site.
You may opt out of the Google Analytics service with Google’s Browser Add-on that’s available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
For information in general about Google’s remarketing ad campaigns, and specifically about information regarding DoubleClick cookies and how to control and manage Google’s advertising cookies for these campaigns, visit https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.

Our web site may also use, on some pages, the HotJar Analysis and Feedback tool. The HotJar service helps us analyze how visitors use our Site. It reveals the online behavior and feedback of our web site's visitors. By combining both A) Analysis and B) Feedback tools, Hotjar gives us the 'big picture' of how to improve our web site visitor’s experience and the site’s performance. We do not collect through the HotJar service or transfer to HotJar any personally identifiable information. We only use the HotJar service to record, for some visitors on some websites and on a completely anonymous basis, information such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as non-personally identifiable information text you type in some of our Site. Information about the browser (type, version, screen size, etc.), basic information about the user (IP address, language, time zone) and data containing mouse movements, clicks, and scroll events are sent to HotJar.

Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies: Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our Site and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.” We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on websites across the Internet. Edvisors adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.
Third-party companies may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on this web site. These technologies may be used directly on this web site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
Notwithstanding the above, we may share information collected from you with third party data providers including web log data and/or hashed email addresses. Third party data providers may place anonymous cookies on your browser to receive customized ads or content, which you can opt out of at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
For more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Cross-device and cross-app technology: We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on your devices that interact with the internet. We and our customers may use technology that establishes deterministic or statistical connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes. This includes cross device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related.
D How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals
Some web browsers or mobile device operating systems incorporate a “Do Not Track” (a/k/a DNT) feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. We do not respond to web browser and/or mobile device operating systems “Do Not Track” signals at this time.

Offer Walls: Our Site may display third-party advertisers’ offers. These advertisers may in turn display their own offers. These offers are not controlled by or made by Edvisors. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or other anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Edvisors or a partnering Third Party Platform. Edvisors may provide points or other virtual rewards to users in exchange for interaction with an advertisement or completion of a specific activity in furtherance of the advertiser’s promotion. Such activities may include signing up for an account with the advertiser. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier and anonymous demographic information may be shared with the offer provider. This information is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be returned to an Edvisors website or service.

If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose web sites may contain links to ours.
