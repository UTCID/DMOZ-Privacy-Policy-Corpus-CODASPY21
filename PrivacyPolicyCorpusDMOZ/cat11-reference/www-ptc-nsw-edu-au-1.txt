Prior learning and skills are recognised, valued and utilised. Clear procedures for planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting contribute to quality assurance and effectiveness of professional development activities.Professional Development is intended to contribute to the growth of the individual, improve student learning and enhance the standing of the profession within the community.Recent Posts Dismantling of Professional Development in NSW Education PTC World Teachers Day Media Release & Announcement of PTC 2020 Award Recipients NESA News – VET: NSW Training Awards 2020 Celebrate NAIDOC Week: 8-15 November 2020 APTA News in Brief – OctoberCategoriesDirector forumNewsEvents1 DecTechnology Educators AssociationAgriculture and Food Technologies – Food Law & RegulationsRead More 1 JanAustralian Society for Music Education NSWZooming into Music Education with ASME NSWRead More 1 JanSociety and Culture AssociationA Taste of the Core!Read More See all events
