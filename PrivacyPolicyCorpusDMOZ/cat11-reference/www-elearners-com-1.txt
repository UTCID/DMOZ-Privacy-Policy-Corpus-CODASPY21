Visit our corporate site at www.educationdynamics.com.Why We’re HereEducation is often the foundation to a person’s development and can change their life in monumental ways. We here at eLearners work hard to provide students with the information they want and need when considering a degree program that may influence their lives for years to come. We also strive to provide access to schools that offer programs that may align with students’ education goals. eLearners hopes that if even one person is hesitant about going back to school and is inspired by the information we have available, then we’ve done our job! Who We HelpHopefully, YOU!Enrolling in a degree program or going back to school can be an intimidating and overwhelming process. Some students don’t know where to start or how to find a program that fits their education goals, their budget, and their busy schedule. The eLearners site offers students a wealth of information on different subject areas and career paths, as well as topics that have to do with going back to school, researching funding options for college, compelling interviews with experts in the field, and so much more. The eLearners management team is devoted to making the school matching process as easy, quick, affordable, and informative as possible. Our match forms are designed to ask simple questions—like year of high school graduation, number of college credits completed, contact information— that our users have the answers to. Then, they select what subject areas and concentrations they’re interested in, and our match algorithm provides program options that fit their interests. Our PartnersThe EducationDynamics mission is deeply committed to student interests; we aim to serve schools best by serving students first.
