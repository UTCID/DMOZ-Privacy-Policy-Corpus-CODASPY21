Frequently Asked Questions
Who we are
The University of St Andrews Students’ Association (‘the Students’ Association’) offers a range of services to students of the University of St Andrews, who are automatically members of the Students’ Association. We are here to make the student experience as strong as it can be, provide services you need and to represent your views to the University and beyond. We operate premises in St Andrews at St Mary’s Place, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9UZ. We are a charity registered in Scotland (SCO19883) regulated by the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR).
Purpose
This Policy explains when and why we collect personal information about our members and other people who visit our website, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.
The Students’ Association is a “data controller”. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you. We are required under data protection legislation to notify you of the information contained in this privacy notice.
Our commitment
The Students’ Association is fully committed to handling personal information in accordance with data protection legislation and data protection and information security best practices. This means that your personal information will be:
Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.
Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.
Only collected so far as required for our lawful purposes.
As accurate and up to date as possible.
Retained for a reasonable period of time, in accordance with retention policies.
Processed in a manner which ensures an appropriate level of security.
Whether through this notice or otherwise, we hope to ensure that everyone has a good understanding of why we processes personal information and, where we do, the rights they may have.
How do we collect personal information?
As students at the University are automatically enrolled as members of the Students’ Association we obtain information about our members directly from the University as part of the matriculation process. We also obtain information about you when you use our website, for example, when you contact us about events and room bookings, to enquire about commercial services, to purchase goods or tickets from our online shop, and if you register to receive our newsletter. In addition, like most organisations that handle personal information, there are various ways in which we collect information from the people we deal with.
Email and written correspondence.
Telephone discussions.
Social media.
Application forms and other information requests.
Direct contact at the Students Association and elsewhere.
In nearly all instances, it should be obvious to you when we are collecting your personal data.
What personal information do we collect?
The personal information most commonly collected is as follows:
Name.
Contact details (including term time and home address, business addresses, email – both University and personal, telephone number).
For visitors to our website – your IP address, and information regarding what pages are accessed and when.
If you make a purchase via our website, your card information is not held by us, it is collected by a third party payment processor, who specialises in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions, as explained below.
Date of birth.
Records of enquiries, meetings and other direct engagement.
Copies of physical and electronic correspondence.
Images obtained from our CCTV system for the purposes of crime detection and health and safety.
How is your information used?
We may use your information to:
keep your membership details up to date;
to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into by you and us;
dealing with entries into a competition;
seek your views or comments on the services we provide;
notify you of changes to our services; and
send you communications which you have requested and that may be of interest to you. These may include information about events, campaigns, societies, appeals, other fundraising activities or promotions of our services; and
process a room booking.
We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations (for example the collection of Gift Aid). We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, such as membership or for room / event bookings, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.
What is the lawful basis for the Students Association’s processing activities?
We will only process personal information where we believe we have a lawful basis to do so. The basis for processing will vary from activity to activity. In some instances, processing may have more than one lawful basis.
The following information below summarises the basis on which we process personal information.

where we use third party suppliers for processing data, such as images captured during our events and published on our website and social media sites.
Do we share personal data with third parties?
We will not sell or rent your information to third parties and we will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes. However, in certain circumstances the processing activities set out above will require us to share personal information with third parties. Whenever we share personal data, we take all reasonable steps to ensure it will be handled appropriately and securely by the third party. However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes. Please be reassured that we will not release your information to third parties for them to use for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.
When you are purchasing event tickets and merchandise via our website, your transaction is processed using an encrypyted payment system which ensures that card data is captured and processed securely. If you have questions regarding secure transactions, please contact us.
We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our members and customers. However, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
The following is a list of the main third parties with whom we share personal information:
Oversight regulators and statutory bodies (e.g. HMRC and OSCR).
Local authorities and health care agencies, such as the NHS.
Software providers which allow us to operate efficient digital processes, including: Sage and Sage Pay
For practical reasons, this is an indicative, but not exhaustive list. Please also note that the list may be updated from time to time.
How long do we retain personal information?
The periods for which we retain personal information depends on the purpose for which the information was obtained but, in general terms, we will retain personal data for so long as required by law, or as may be required for record keeping and legal claims purposes.
Where do we store personal information?
Personal information is mostly processed by our staff at the Students’ Association in St Andrews. To allow us to operate efficient digital processes, we need to store information in servers owned by the University which are located in the UK. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Policy.
We use Sage Pay for our online payment processing. Sage pay holds users personal information on servers located in the United States of America (the U.S.), which is recognised by the EU as an 'adequate' country (i.e. safe country) to receive and process EU personal data, pursuant to European Commission Decision 2013/65/EU. For EU residents, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the U.S. Sage Pay has in place transfer mechanisms that satisfy the requirements relating to the transfer of data from the European Union to the U.S.
By entering personal information into the Services, you consent to that personal information being hosted on servers located in the U.S. While your personal information will be stored on servers located in the U.S., it will remain within Sage Pay’s effective control at all times. Each data hosting provider’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to Sage Pay, and Sage Pay have taken steps to ensure that its data hosting providers do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, your personal information. They do not control, and are not permitted to access or use your personal information, except for the limited purpose of storing the information.
To ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection we have put in place the following appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection: For example, a binding data sharing agreement which includes data access, data security and information sharing clauses. If you require further information about these protective measures, you can request it using the contact details below.
