This notice explains how F&M will collect and process your personal data when you access this website.
1. Automated Collection of Personal Information
When you access the College’s website, certain information will automatically be recorded by F&M’s third party website hosting company, Linode, which is managed by our third-party website software vendor, P’unk Ave.  Information collected includes your IP address, what browser you are using, and information related to the pages you visit. This information informs decisions about future site improvements and in some instances could aid detection in the event of a security breach.
2. Non-Automated Collection
Where you are required under this website to provide personal data, the uses of this data will be indicated at the point of collection, for example when filling out an online form requesting more information or to sign up for a College event.
3. Third-party access
The personal data you provide will only be sent to third parties with which Franklin & Marshall College has a contractual relationship and that 3rd party assists in one or more aspects of the College’s data processing for business purposes.
Disclosures
Your data is held confidentially and securely in all of these systems.  These partners are only allowed to use your data in accordance with the strict instructions of F&M.  Neither party will use your data in any other way nor will they share it with any other organization.
F&M revises this notice annually.  To learn of any changes to these exceptions since the publication date (seen at the bottom of the notice), contact dpo@fandm.edu
Area #1 - online admissions-related inquiries and applications
F&M, similar to all U.S.-based institutions of higher education works with third-party partners (the Coalition for Access, Technolutions, The Common Application, FrontRush, Hobbson’s, RaiseMe, CHEGG, and The College Board) as part of our admissions processes.  These partners assist with some or all of the following: identifying potential applicants, processing admissions inquiries, tour scheduling, email marketing, and application processing for both Admissions and Financial Aid. Should you be offered admission to F&M, a 3rd-party payment processor will process your credit card deposit payment.
If you submit data through any of the online forms related to admission on F&M’s website, our partner organizations will use your personal data to respond to your inquiry and/or process your application.  You will be asked to acknowledge our intent to collect and process your data in each of these online forms.
Area #2- online engagement with alumni and friends of the College
F&M works with a third party partner (iModules) to provide an alumni portal, process online gifts, send email communications, and accept online event registrations.  If you submit data through any of the online forms related to alumni, our partner organization will use your personal data to respond to your inquiry and/or process your gift or registration.
Area #3 - to provide better student and employee experiences
F&M works with several third-party providers (TerraDotta, HandShake, Blackboard, Maxient, Instructure, OCLC’s WorldShare Management System, FrontRush, ATS, ScriptSafe, National Student Clearinghouse, Interfolio and Interview Exchange, and Rave Mobile Tracker) to provide services to students and in some cases employees as well.  These vendors provide services such as a study abroad application portal, career services and mentoring portal, ID card and dining plan management, athletic team membership management, conduct management, online course management, library lending, academic transcript production, faculty and staff recruitment and hiring support and emergency notification systems.

6. Email marketing
Admission, Athletics, Advancement, and general Communications email marketing to prospective students as well as parents and alumni may include UTM codes. A UTM code is a simple code that you can attach to a custom URL in order to track a source, medium, and campaign name. This enables Google Analytics to tell F&M which particular marketing message brought you to our website. All email marketing provides an opportunity for you to completely unsubscribe from all F&M-related emails or only from select marketing campaigns.
