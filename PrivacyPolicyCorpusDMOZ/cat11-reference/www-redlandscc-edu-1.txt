ACADEMICS
Few colleges the size of Redlands have such a wide range of academic programs — not to mention the levels of excellence. Redlands houses a chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the largest Honors Society for two-year colleges.
Undergraduates at Redlands get to be involved in conducting research. Plus, all classes are taught by the full professor: there are no graduate-student teachers.

Paying for Redlands
A college education at Redlands costs less than the Oklahoma state average for public institutions (based on cost per credit hour). For students planning to attain a four-year degree, completing the first two at Redlands can save you thousands.
Figuring out the process of paying for college can be intimidating, especially in households where parents haven't gone themselves. We make it easy.
