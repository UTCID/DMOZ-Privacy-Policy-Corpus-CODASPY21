A cookie contains a unique number that allows Lesson Planet to recognize your computer. We use both session (temporary) and persistent cookies. A session cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and expires when you close your browser. We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you navigate website pages. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the service. Persistent cookies, for example, allow us to keep track of your username and password (if you are a Member), so you don’t have to re-enter that information each time you visit.Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. The Help function on most Internet browsers contains information on how to set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of Lesson Planet may not function properly if cookies are disabled.We use web beacons (also known as clear gifs) on some of our website pages in conjunction with cookies to compile statistics about site usage. Web beacons are small pieces of code that are embedded on the pages of websites or applications so we can detect when they have been viewed. We or our service providers use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on Lesson Planet, such as the frequency with which our Members visit various parts of our website or use our other products and services, such as mobile applications, and to measure site effectiveness.We also use web beacons in HTML emails that we send our Members and visitors to determine whether recipients have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails.When you post comments on resources, we record the IP address from which your posts originate. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server. We use this information to safeguard the Community from harmful behavior and to determine, generally, the regional makeup of our membership.On their own, cookies and web beacons do not contain or reveal any Personally Identifiable Information. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. However, if you choose to furnish Lesson Planet with Personally Identifiable Information, for example by subscribing to Lesson Planet, this information can be associated with the data collected using cookies or web beacons. These technical methods, which may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to our service providers, allow us to make our website and services, and any emails you have agreed to receive, more relevant to you.We use third party vendors, including Google, to direct online advertisements about Lesson Planet to visitors to our site who we think might benefit from our services.
