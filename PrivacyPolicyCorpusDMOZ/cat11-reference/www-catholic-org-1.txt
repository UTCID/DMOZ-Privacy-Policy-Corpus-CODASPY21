CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC may allow third parties to display or provide Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services on or through the Site. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC, its partners and/or advertisers, or social networks, may use third party servers to serve or present the Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services that appear on the Site and to conduct research about the Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services. Any of these third party servers may collect non-personal information, such as your browser, operating system, date/time of viewing, IP address, Device ID, or clickstream data. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC cannot control the activities of such third parties, web sites or social networks. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVERS OR SOCIAL NETWORKS.
Tracking Technologies.
CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC or its third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and Web Beacons, to collect information about users who visit or use the Site and view or interact with Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services on or through the Site.
4.1 Cookies. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC uses "cookies" to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site.
a.
A "cookie" is a small file or tool stored on your computer or device containing information that allows CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC to deliver customized information to you. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on the Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer or device. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer or device and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer or device for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.
b.
You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies. Certain features of the Site, including certain Content, Promotions or Services, may not, however, function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC cannot recognize you, CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC wants you to be aware that these programs are available.
We ask you, humbly, to help.
Hi readers, it seems you use Catholic Online a lot; that's great!
It's a little awkward to ask, but we need your help. If you have already donated, we sincerely thank you.
We're not salespeople, but we depend on donations averaging $14.76 and fewer than 1% of readers give. If you donate just $5.00, the price of your coffee, Catholic Online School could keep thriving.
Thank you. Help Now >
4.2 Web Beacons. During your use of the Site, you may encounter Web Beacons, which may come from CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC or from third parties that display or provide Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services on the Site.
a.
A "Web Beacon" (sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif") is a small graphic image in a web page, a web-based document or an email message that generally allows the party that set the Web Beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or email message and may allow access to certain cookies. Web Beacons are usually invisible to the user because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). In general, however, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an Advertisement or Content, can act as a Web Beacon.
b.
Web Beacons on the Site typically collect the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon originates, the type of browser requesting the Web Beacon, the IP address of the computer or Device ID of the device to which the Web Beacon is sent and the time that the Web Beacon was viewed.
c.
Certain Web Beacons used by third party advertisers, content providers or other service providers may collect information that allows such third parties to determine how many people are viewing and/or clicking on certain Advertisements or viewing certain Content, Promotions or Services for purposes of helping these parties serve and manage their Advertisements, Content, Promotions and Services. These Web Beacons do not collect or store Personal Information but they may, however, be used in conjunction with cookies to identify certain aggregate information about users.
4.3Do Not Track Disclosures.
a.
CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC or its third parties may also use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across third-party websites or other online services. The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is a cooperative group of ad serving providers. The NAI has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere. The NAI is committed to providing consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet generally. For more information about the NAI, third party ad servers generally and the opt-out options offered through the NAI, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp.
b.
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC responds to "Do Not Track" browser settings. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC continues to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
To all our readers, Please don't scroll past this.
Today, we humbly ask you to defend Catholic Online's independence. 98% of our readers don't give; they simply look the other way. If you donate just $5.00, or whatever you can, Catholic Online could keep thriving for years. Most people donate because Catholic Online is useful. If Catholic Online has given you $5.00 worth of knowledge this year, take a minute to donate. Show the volunteers who bring you reliable, Catholic information that their work matters. If you are one of our rare donors, you have our gratitude and we warmly thank you.
