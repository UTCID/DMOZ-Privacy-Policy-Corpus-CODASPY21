The University of Michigan School of Information collects no information from website visitors in any personally-identifiable fashion. As an entity, we store no cookies and don’t track your progress across this or any other site. We’ve actively removed tools from our site specifically because we didn’t agree with their tracking policies.
We do employ tools to serve you content and track overall site traffic in aggregated forms, which do track your visit on the site in a non-personally-identifiable way, combining it with others’ to present a comprehensive whole. This includes services for site analytics, uptime status, heat maps, and tracking JavaScript errors.
Because we occasionally use Google AdWords to direct visitors to our site, our analytics module does include AdSense.
