Recording and Privacy PolicyIf faculty plan to record the classroom sessions:Let students know you’re going to record class sessions.Offer students the option to mute their video during the recordings.Only share the recordings by placing recording link on MOLE/Schoology.Ask students not to reproduce and share recordings in any fashion.Add syllabus recording and privacy statements to your syllabus.Class RecordingIn some classes videoconferencing software will be used to record live class discussions. As a student in such classes,
student participation in live class discussions will be recorded. These recordings will be made available only to students
enrolled in the class, to assist those who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like
to review content that was presented. All recordings will become unavailable to students in the class when the class ends.
Students who prefer to participate via audio only will be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured.
Students should discuss this option with their instructors. The use of all video recordings will be in keeping with the Privacy
Statement shown below:PrivacyAssuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and
robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom.
As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class
purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered.
Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent
of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have
been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.
