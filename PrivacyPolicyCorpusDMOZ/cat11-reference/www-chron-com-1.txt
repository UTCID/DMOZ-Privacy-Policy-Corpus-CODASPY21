As parents who traditionally depend on public school pivot to the new normal of at-home learning, online resources used or created by homeschool parents can provide a platform to learn about supporting educational needs.
Sam Sorbo, a homeschool parent and representative of the non-profit Texas Home School Coalition, said the organization stepped into action after public school closures due to the novel coronavirus. THSC developed a website for parents to provide educational tools for learning from home that will be offered for free through April 30.
ON HOUSTONCHRONICLE.COM: Now more than ever, Houston’s ‘digital divide’ puts children’s education in peril
Sorbo, who has been the home school educator of her three children for over 10 years and published two books, recommends signing up for daily curriculum emails on the THSC coronavirus education website. Sorbo said parents and children can learn together about the world through home education.
“I think the struggle we have today is that parents feel completely inadequate to the task of education, and that is too bad. They are infinitely adequate to the task of education, especially because they don’t know what they’re doing,” Sorbo said. “...A parent who doesn’t know very much about the world, as long as they are willing to learn, they can show the child how to learn about the world, and that’s a wonderful thing.”
CORONAVIRUS CLOSURES: Humble ISD extends school closures through May 1 after Gov. Abbott’s order
With the closures of public schools, Sorbo said this is an opportunity for parents to see what their children are learning in school. She recommends downloading the curriculum they provide and compare and contrast what public schools and homeschooling programs are teaching. Sorbo said the reason she starting teaching from home was that what her school was providing was inadequate based on a systemic issue.
“The idea is that the parents now have this opportunity that they’ve been given to see what the kids are learning in their schools and to come alongside the children and help them in their endeavor to satisfy their curiosity about the world,” Sorbo said.
