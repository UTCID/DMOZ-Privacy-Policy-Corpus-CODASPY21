AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
NTC is committed to making its digital content accessible for all users. In accordance with this commitment, and with the knowledge that accessible digital content generally enhances usability for everyone, this Policy is established to ensure accessibility for those with disabilities. If you have a disability that may cause any difficulty in accessing any part of this digital content, please feel free to email us at help@newteachercenter.org. We will work with you to provide the necessary accommodation(s) you seek to ensure our digital content  is accessible for you consistent with applicable law.
COPYRIGHT POLICY
Tell us if you think a user has violated your copyright using the Site, or if you think someone incorrectly reported that you violated his or her copyright.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Site;
Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
We may terminate the accounts and/or prevent content posting of users who repeatedly infringe copyright holders’ copyrights. A “repeat infringer” is a user who, on more than two occasions, has been determined by final order of a United States court to have infringed the copyright rights of a third party by providing infringing content through the Site.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to copyright@newteachercenter.org or at New Teacher Center, 1205 Pacific Avenue, Suite 301, Santa Cruz, CA 95060. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
