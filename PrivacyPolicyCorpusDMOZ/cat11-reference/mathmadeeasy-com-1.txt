About
Math Made Easy was established in 1985 by a group of distinguished math educators with years of
teaching experience both on high school and college levels.
The underlying mission of Math Made Easy is to utilize modern technology to help enhance the visual
experience of learning mathematics. Many students are stymied by the fast paced learning in most
math classes and these video presentations offer visual enhancements to review lessons until it finally
"clicks".
Over the course of the last 35 years, Math Made Easy programs have helped thousands of students who
were struggling in their classes to pass their tests and even excel at math! The programs have been
updated and redesigned to incorporate new improved visual technologies and to incorporate all the
topics that are part of today's curriculum.
