Wish List
The greatest return on an investment is to give it a voice.
The cost to educate one child at MOSD is $50,000 per year. Because of your help, no child has ever been turned away for a family’s inability to pay. Your support is vital to ensuring that these children receive the necessary services at the most critical time for learning speech and language.
Your gifts throughout the year provide specialized speech and language training - without the use of sign language - so that our young students are prepared to go to their local kindergarten with their hearing classmates, ready to learn and succeed.
Our most sincere thanks to every individual, business, and organization for your gifts to MOSD. With your generous support our children can say "Thank You" for themselves!
