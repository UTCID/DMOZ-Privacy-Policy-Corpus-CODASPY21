What is Facebook Connect?
Facebook Connect allows users to share community information very quickly and efficiently based on their facebook account. To learn more about Facebook Connect http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=730
How does privacy work with Facebook Connect sites?
When you connect with a website, it can access information you've added through Facebook to allow you to interact with your friends in new and interesting ways. The Platform Developer Terms of Service restrict how Yellow Pages Group can access this information, and all sites are contractually obligated to respect the privacy settings you've chosen for your account. These are the same terms that developers who have created the applications you use on Facebook must follow.
This means that if you've blocked a user on Facebook, that user will not be able to see you on a "connected" site. When other users connect with a website, those users will not be able to see information you've added through Facebook that they wouldn't otherwise be able to see simply by browsing Facebook. You can decide what type of information your friends' applications can access from the "Applications and Websites" section on the Privacy Settings page.

Through new partnerships with leading online portals including TripAdvisor® and foursquare®, business profiles are enriched with content that online consumers are increasingly expecting to find.

First and foremost, we encourage users to share their opinions and experiences for any business type. Yellowpages.ca users can enter reviews on any business, from a restaurant or hotel to a dentist clinic or car repair shop.
An overview of what it means to write a review:
All reviewers must first be logged in, via Facebook Connect or your Yellow Pages account, before sharing an experience.
Once logged in, a reviewer will be taken to our review submission form and asked to rate, from 1 to 5 stars, the business service or product's overall performance.
Your opinion will reach further than you think! If you have provided us the permission via the review submission form, a Facebook news feed post will appear automatically, to share with all your friends about the review you've entered on YellowPages.ca site.
Moderation process for YellowPages.ca ratings and reviews - here's how it works
We have put in place automatic filters to screen any profanity from the get-go. Users will not be able to submit reviews before removing inappropriate terms.
Once submitted, reviews will not be instantly published online; they will be moderated by Yellow Pages Group to ensure any abusive content, privacy issues or liability matters are rejected. Text submitted will be screened against predetermined guidelines to ensure Yellow Pages Group publishes proper content that will enhance the online community experience.
All review rejection causes are listed and available within the review submission process (see details below).

Tips to write a great review:
Yellow Pages Group reviews are useful, relevant and real because our users are taking part in the community by sharing opinions and experiences on our businesses and their services.
The best reviews are detailed, personal and often provide helpful tips on how to make the most of visiting that specific business. The most useful reviews focus on what makes a business stand-out and which type of clientele has a high propensity to also like or dislike the business.
An overview of how to read and browse through reviews
All business owners' profile pages will be equipped with a new section dedicated to presenting all reviews received from our online visitors.
These listed reviews are a trustworthy source of information for online visitors that are in the process of selecting a service or product business provider.
Reading through the detailed reviews or sorting through them by number of stars will also enhance the online experience by presenting relevant information to the users.
