confidential resource; Health Education Services (HES) provides free and confidential counseling for students and the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) provides free and confidential counseling for faculty and staff. For more information on Title IX at Georgetown, including on- and off-campus resources, reporting options, and University policies, please visit the Georgetown University Sexual Misconduct website.
