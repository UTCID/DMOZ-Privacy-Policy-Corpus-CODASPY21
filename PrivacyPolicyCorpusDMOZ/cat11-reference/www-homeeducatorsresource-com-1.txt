Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice
explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way
your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information
may be requested.
The Information We Collect
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Home Educator's
Resource website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to
receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages
are:
Name Address Email address Phone number Credit/Debit Card Information (etc.)
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you
order a book online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit
the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information
collected are:
Name Address Phone Number (etc.)
The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to
complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to
the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to
ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside
parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another
person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that
purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not
used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to receive discou as well as
updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will
not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to
share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of
individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number
of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that
could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us
online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an
opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we
never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are
under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and
maintain by logging in to your account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending
us a request that credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your
identity before granting access or making corrections.
How To Contact Us
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please
contact us by filling out our Contact Us form here. Please be very specific as to why you are contacting us. Thank
