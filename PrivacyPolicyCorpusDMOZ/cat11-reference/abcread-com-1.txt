The program is great. I give it an A+ in my book. I love how I am learning how to understand the sounds. A program like this is very hard to locate. The cards work so well with the DVDs. The pictures on the DVDs and the flashcards help the person with a learning problem. I can review the program many times to help me understand. There is lots of material to learn, and I can do it at home. There is no rush to complete the program.
