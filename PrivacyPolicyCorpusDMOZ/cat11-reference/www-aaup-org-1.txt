Privacy Policy
The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the AAUP Foundation are committed to keeping any and all information collected from or about individuals that visit our websites and make use of our online facilities and services accurate, confidential, secure and private. This Privacy Policy applies only to the websites at www.aaup.org and www.aaupfoundation.org, and related interactions with those sites, and it shall govern any and all data collection and usage thereof. It does not apply to information we collect and maintain through other means.
It is highly recommended that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use as a means to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of, and share information collected.
SPECIAL ALERT TO NON-UNITED STATES USERS. Our servers are located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, be aware that the information you provide us may be transferred to the United States and the law applicable to the protection of user information in the United States may be different from the laws of your jurisdiction.

You may visit the portions of these websites that do not require registration without actively providing any personal information. However, we may collect any information provided by your web browser, including the IP address assigned to your computer when you access the Internet (including any information available through reverse-DNS lookup of that IP address, such as the domain name of your internet service provider), the address of the previous website that you visited, if you linked to one of our sites from another website, the address of the next website that you visit, if you visit it from a link on our website, as well as your browser type, browser language, type of operating system, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We may also collect information obtained from images embedded in HTML-format email or web pages (i.e., “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) to link email with your subsequent interactions on our website or to track your interactions among the websites we administer and those of third parties. If you view any content on these websites through an RSS feed, we may collect information obtained through your RSS reader.
These websites use cookies to identify your computer and browser, so that it can recognize that you are the same user from page to page. A cookie is a piece of data stored temporarily or persistently on your hard drive containing information we specify, which enables us to provide a consistent user experience and collect usage data about your visit, including the pages visited, items searched for and any other interactions you have with these websites. If you are logged in, we may link any such cookies (and the associated usage data) with the registration information you have provided and the other information we collect from you. We may permit third-party advertisers and content providers on these websites to set separate cookies, which shall be governed by such third parties’ privacy policies.
Portions of certain of these websites require registration, including those that involve membership application, meeting registration, and information requests. To register, you may be asked to provide a variety of information, including your name, email address and type (home or work), and address. To join or renew as a member, we also require your home address, institutional affiliation, and employment status (full-time, part-time, etc.)
We shall endeavor and shall take every precaution to maintain adequate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the very personal information under our control.
Any of the information we collect from you as described above may be used for the following purposes:

These websites contain links to other sites run by outside people and organizations. Our linking to such sites is merely a reference, and does not imply any endorsement or control of those sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such sites. Check the privacy policy of any such website before you reveal any personal information.
Except for the uses outlined above, we will release information you provide without prior notice to you only if required to do so in accordance with applicable laws and/or in a good faith belief that such action is deemed necessary or is required by law.
When you make comments on articles or participate in any other community activities on these websites, your user name, your comments, and any other information you may designate will be retained and displayed to other users. To the extent that we use any third-party authentication service in connection with comments or other community content, we may retain and display to other users the user name provided by such service. Your participation by leaving comments or participating in other community features of these websites is governed by our Commenting Policy. In the event that we migrate any of our community activities to another organization or website, we may also transfer the information you have provided in connection with your participation, so that it may be displayed by the new organization or on the new website.
This privacy policy is effective immediately.

This privacy notice also provides mandatory information as required under Articles 13 and 14 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding the transparency of personal data processing for anyone residing or browsing in a European Union country (“EU”). As a potential EU data subject, you may have rights under the GDPR. The AAUP will always fully respect your rights regarding the processing of your personal data. These are:
The right to be informed; this means anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.
The right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data.
The right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.
The right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten.’ This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.
The right to restrict processing; this gives the potential EU data subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being corrected.
The right to data portability; a potential EU data subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to a person, public authority, agency or other body by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
The right to object; the potential EU data subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; potential EU data subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.
