NewsCrozier Acquires West-Coast Based Fine Art Shipping (FAS)Crozier, an Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM) company and the nation’s leading fine art storage and logistics provider, announced the acquisition of the Los Angeles company Fine Art Shipping  (FAS). The exponential growth of the art market has fueled Crozier’s expansion from its New York City roots to provide full-service, global solutions to clients invested in the art world. The FAS facility will be Crozier’s first West Coast location, joining its eight existing facilities in the New York metropolitan area, Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware. This acquisition was part of Iron Mountain’s purchase of Bonded Services Group earlier this month, which formerly owned FAS.Since 1982, FAS has provided comprehensive storage, logistics, crating, handling, and installation services to a diverse roster of clients from its strategic location near the Los Angeles International Airport and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. FAS storage facilities provide a fully secure and climate controlled environment with a private viewing gallery. The company also operates regular art shuttle services from Los Angeles to San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area.“The West Coast, and Los Angeles in particular, are among the fastest-growing centers for all segments of the art market,” said Simon Hornby, President of Crozier. “As the fine art storage and logistics industry becomes increasingly competitive, a permanent presence on the West Coast is a key advantage in ensuring a streamlined and seamless trans-continental service experience for our clients, particularly our expanding Asian client base.”About CrozierBased in New York, Crozier is an industry-leader in art storage and logistics and an advocate for worldwide commercial standards.
