Student Conduct and Safety Policies
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student educational records. A FERPA form needs to be completed by the student in order to allow others to access their San Juan College records.
The Student Handbook includes student resources such as the policies and procedures of the College, including the behavioral standards expected of all San Juan College students, guest and visitors. In addition to policies, the student handbook includes student activities and department information.
In an effort to comply with Senate Memorial 63 set forth by the State of New Mexico, by 2020 all SJC campuses will be tobacco/smoke-free. Beginning August 15, 2015, SJC has adopted a step-down process that will begin with 7 designated tobacco use areas.
San Juan College believes that the basis for personal and academic development is honesty. Personal commitment, honest work, and honest achievement are necessary characteristics for an educated person.
Students wishing to submit written complaints regarding college student services issues may do so with the Vice President for Student Services. The student should first follow any documented procedures for handling of concerns as covered in the Academic Catalog before submitting concerns to the Office of the Vice President.
Student Rights
San Juan College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, age, genetic, veteran’s status, or on the basis of any other category protected under federal, state and local laws, in any educational programs and activities, or in its employment and admissions decisions.
Under the Clery Act, students have the right to know about crime on and around the SJC campus. San Juan College Department of Public Safety provides the annual crime rate information
San Juan College does not tolerate any sexual violence to include intimate partner violence which can be defined as any physical sexual, or psychological harm against an individual by a current or former partner or spouse of the individual.
