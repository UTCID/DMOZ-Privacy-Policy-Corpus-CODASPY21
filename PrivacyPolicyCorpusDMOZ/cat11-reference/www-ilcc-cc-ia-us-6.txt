FERPA
THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS
and PRIVACY ACT of 1974
FERPA Compliance
FERPA is an acronym for the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974, as amended.
This law protects the privacy of student educational records and gives students the right to refuse to permit any educational institution, including Iowa Lakes, from releasing or disclosing any information about them.
The purpose of FERPA is to identify the student rights pertaining to their educational records. Those rights include:
The right to inspect and review their educational records
The right to have their records amended
The right to control the disclosure of information from their records
FERPA sets forth requirements regarding the privacy of student educational records and limits the release of personally identifiable information.
FERPA governs release of these records maintained by an educational institution and access to these records.
Coverage under this act begins upon enrollment.  It also protects former students and student records from other institutions.
High school students enrolled in a college class are considered college students and fall under FERPA guidelines.
Parents and/or legal guardians cannot be given any information regarding classroom performance or grades unless there is a signed consent form on file in the Registrar’s office.
Compliance with FERPA regulations allows Iowa Lakes to offer Title IV funding (federal financial aid) to students
What is an "Educational Record?"
An “Educational Record” is any record maintained by the institution or its affiliates which is related to the student, including, but not limited to the following:
Academic records, regardless of their location
Advising records
Class notes and grades
Instructor records
Financial Aid Information and account records
Photographs
E-mails containing personally identifiable information about the student
All media including, but not limited to electronic data, video and audiotape
Letters to, from, or about students
Grade books –
Records kept by an affiliate of the institution, such as work experience or clinical notes etc. kept by the entity where the student is learning
Student conduct records
Disability records
Notes in any student information system or hand written and shared with others
Aggregate data that is grouped in such a way that someone could discern the identity of a student
Any written document, whether formal or informal that contains personally identifiable information about a student that is shared with another individual or individuals, becomes an educational record
Records that are publicly available elsewhere
Information that the student has publicly revealed
An Educational record does NOT include:
Information that is not “recorded” – that is personal knowledge.
Records or notes in the sole possession of the maker that are not accessible or revealed to any other person
Information not shared or accessible; kept by a single person as a “memory jogger.”  For example, the private notes an instructor may keep during the course of a semester for consultation when it comes time to set final grades
grades on peer-graded papers until collected and recorded
Employment records that have no relationship to student status
Law Enforcement records
Admission records, unless or until the prospect becomes an active student
Information: Confidential or Directory:
“Directory Information,” can be released without the student's written permission, UNLESS the student opts to consider directory information "confidential “
When the student elect’s privacy of their directory information, DO NOT RELEASE INFORMATION about the student
“Confidential information” can only be released with the written consent of the student
Directory Information at Iowa Lakes:
This information is considered directory information or public information and may be released unless specifically restricted by action of the student. It is best practice to refer any inquiry about student information to the Records Office.

FERPA Inspection/Review
Students have the right to inspect and review information contained in their educational records.  The student must make a written request to the Director of Records and Registration.
Health and Safety Emergencies
Institutions may release information from education records, without consent, in connection with an “articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals”
Disclosure may be made only to “appropriate parties” and must be limited to “information [that] is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals”
Verification of Student’s Identification/E-mail Contact
If e-mailing, ensure email address being used matches the e-mail address listed in student’s record
If email does not match, respond that you are only able to fulfill their request to the official email address on file

This includes, but is not limited to:

Feedback on assignments
Academic/course progress
Phone Contact
Do not release grade information or performance in a class, including, but not limited to, feedback on assignments or tests, clinical experiences, critiques of papers, and coop work experiences over the phone.
If a third party calls and provides the students’ SSN in an attempt to obtain directory information, the requested information cannot be disclosed at that time. It is suggested that you ask that the request for information be faxed or mailed to the Registrar’s office.
Please adhere to the following:
Lock your computer and/or log out when you walk away from your computer, whether on campus, at home, or in any other venue.
If you use a thumb drive–remove from your computer if it contains private student information
Carefully protect access to your passwords
Carefully log out of any publicly accessible computer and ensure that you have not saved any passwords or data on the hard drive
Your Access to Records
FERPA permits college officials access and use of student records for legitimate educational purposes.
“Legitimate educational purpose” is defined as a college official’s need to know in order to perform a job related task, an instructional task, a service or benefit for the student.
Service or benefit such as counseling, student financial aid, or student job placement, etc.
As an employee of Iowa Lakes, you have access to student records on a “need to know” basis. Accessing or using student information for other than legitimate educational purposes is strictly prohibited.  Their confidentiality, use, and release are governed by FERPA.  You have a responsibility to protect all education records in your possession or that you come in contact with during the course of your job.
Violation of FERPA is Serious
It can lead to:
Possible prosecution under criminal codes
Dismissal or Termination
Loss of Federal funding to the institution
If you have questions about what is permitted under the Act, contact the Registrar.
