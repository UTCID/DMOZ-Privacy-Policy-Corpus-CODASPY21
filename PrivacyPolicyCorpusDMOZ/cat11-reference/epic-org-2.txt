(c) Disclosure of personally identifiable information
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a cable operator shall
not disclose personally identifiable information concerning any
subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the
subscriber concerned and shall take such actions as are necessary
to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person
other than the subscriber or cable operator.
(2) A cable operator may disclose such information if the

activity related to, a cable service or other service provided by

the -
(I) extent of any viewing or other use by the subscriber of

over the cable system of the cable operator.

at a convenient place designated by such cable operator.
A cable
subscriber shall be provided reasonable opportunity to correct any
error in such information.
(e) Destruction of information

requests or orders for access to such information under subsection
(d) of this section or pursuant to a court order.
(f) Civil action in United States district court; damages;

violation of this section may bring a civil action in a United
States district court.

consistent with this section for the protection of subscriber
privacy.
(h) Disclosure of information to governmental entity pursuant to
court order
A governmental entity may obtain personally identifiable
information concerning a cable subscriber pursuant to a court order
only if, in the court proceeding relevant to such court order -
