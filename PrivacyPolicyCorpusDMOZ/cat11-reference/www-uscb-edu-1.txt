including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, subscribe
to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other
activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may

We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact
with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name,
the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to
our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized
and other similar information.
Web browser cookies
Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. A User's Web browser places
cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information
about them. Users may choose to set their Web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert
them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site
may not function properly.

How we protect your information
We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security
measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction
of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data
stored on our Site.
Sharing your personal information
We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others.
We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal
identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners,
trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. We may use third
party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer
activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share
your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that
you have given us your permission. Laws do exist in the State of South Carolina to
ensure government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records
and information possessed by a government agency. At the same time, however, there
are exceptions to the public's right to access certain records in order to protect
against the unreasonable invasion of personal privacy of individuals. Such exceptions
are authorized by both State and Federal law. Information collected from users of
this Site, similarly to information collected during in-person visits to a government
office, may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption
exists in law. In the event there is a conflict between this Privacy Statement and
a State or Federal law governing the disclosure of public records, the applicable
law shall control. The Family Privacy Protection Act of 2002 prohibits persons or
private entities from using personal information obtained from State agencies for
commercial solicitation purposes. A person knowingly violating this prohibition is
guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties specified in S.C. Code Ann. Section
30-2-50(D).
Third party websites
Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that links to the sites and
services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third
parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are
not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site.
In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly
changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and constituent
service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites
which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.
Changes to this privacy statement
University of South Carolina Beaufort has the discretion to update this privacy statement
at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed
about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge
and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy statement periodically
and become aware of modifications.
