Housing Policy
Residency Requirements
All full-time Campbellsville University students must live in one of our residence halls unless they meet one of the following provisions:
Be classified as a commuter (defined below) and live with parents or legal guardian within a 50-mile radius of Campbellsville University’s main campus.
Transfer to Campbellsville University with 80 hours or more with at least a 2.5 GPA.
Be 22 years of age or older.
Be a veteran of the U.S. military service.
A resident student is defined as a full-time student between the ages of 17-24 who lives in university campus housing.
A commuter student is defined as a student who is a dependent of parent or legal guardian with whom he/she has physical residence, living within a 50-mile radius of Campbellsville University’s main campus.
NOTE: Changing status from resident to commuter and moving off campus may affect and reduce financial aid. Students are encouraged to check with the Office of Financial Aid before making plans to change status and move off-campus. Any student approved to change status and live off-campus is automatically removed from the reservation list for a residence hall room and meal plan. Application forms to change status and live off-campus may be obtained from the Office of Student Services. Failure to complete and process this form could keep the student from completing registration and/or attending classes.
In the event that a resident student discovers that she is pregnant, the University wants to provide her with support and resources to ensure the health of both the mother-to-be and the baby.
Therefore, it is imperative that the mother-to-be inform the residence life staff as soon as the pregnancy is determined. The mother-to-be will be provided with the full support of the University’s resources to find suitable off-campus housing that both protects her and the baby and enables her to continue her education as long as possible. It is best that the transition to off-campus living is accomplished by the end of the second trimester of the pregnancy.
Room Assignments
Room assignments are made by the residence hall staff with some priority given to previous occupants and in order of receipt of room requests. The contractual statement of the application must be signed and constitutes a binding agreement between the student and the University. Written request for specific rooms and roommates are honored whenever possible. THE UNIVERSITY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ASSIGN ROOMS ACCORDING TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STUDENT AND THE UNIVERSITY. Requests for private rooms are honored only if space is available. In most cases, the student who has lived in the room for the longest period will have priority in assignment of that room.

Residence Hall Check-In/Check-Out Procedures
Check-In
For incoming new students, residence halls officially open at 10:00 am on the Saturday before classes begin each semester. For returning students, residence halls officially open at 1:00 pm on the Sunday before classes begin each semester. The residence hall staff will conduct check-in when the student first arrives. A health insurance card, as well as your license plate number, is required to complete the necessary paperwork. After receiving the room key, a resident assistant (RA) will show the student to his/her room and assist the student in filling out the Check-In Form This form is to record any damages that exist before the student moves into the room (blinds, carpet, furniture, etc.). This same form will be used to check each student out of his/her room at the end of the semester or upon leaving school. The purpose of this form is to ensure a student is not charged for damage he/she did not cause throughout the year. After signing off on the Check-In Form and signing the Residence Hall Contract, the student is then allowed to begin to move his/her belongings into the dorm.
Check-Out
Students must get approval from the residence hall director before moving out of their room. After approval is given, the resident must have an RA or RD complete the Check-Out Form. This form is again signed by the student stating that the condition of the room is accurately stated on the Check-Out Form. If a student does not check-out with an RA or RD, there is an automatic $50.00 charge applied to the student’s account along with any other damage charges found in the room that were not stated on the Check-In Form. It is imperative that the student checks out with an RA or RD to avoid any unnecessary charges.
No room changes will be made without approval from the residence hall director and director of residence life. Students will have three weeks at the beginning of the semester to request roommate or room changes. After the three weeks, unless there are extenuating circumstances, students will be expected to remain in the room assigned until the end of the semester. To move after this date may result in a charge.
To make a room change, a Room Change Request Form must be obtained from the residence hall director, completed and returned. The resident director will bring the form to the director of residence life. Upon approval, the residence hall director will be notified and, in turn, will inform the residents of the decision.
Care of Rooms
Each student is responsible for the care and cleanliness of his/her room/bathroom. He/she is responsible for keeping wastebaskets emptied, beds made and floors clean. In South Hall East, Broadway Hall and Residence Villages, occupants are responsible for keeping their bathrooms clean and providing their own cleaning supplies. There will be an announced weekly room-check. Fines will be assessed if room/bathroom is not satisfactorily clean. At the end of the semester, students will be charged a minimum of $50.00 for cleaning if rooms are not left satisfactorily clean.
The following electrical appliances are not allowed in residence hall rooms because of fire and safety hazards as determined by the fire marshal:
Electric Skillets
Grills (electric or non-electric)
Hot Plates
Toasters or Broilers
Space Heaters
Live/Artificial Christmas trees with strands of electrical lights
Neither candles nor incense are allowed in residence hall rooms.
Small refrigerators (approximately 1-3 cubic feet), microwaves, TV’s, stereos, computers, etc. are permitted in individual rooms. Power strips and surge protectors for these additional appliances are recommended.
It is prohibited to use nails, colored plastic, screws, magic mounts, tape or glue on walls, doors or furniture. Only white poster putty is approved for use.
Keeping in mind that we are a Christian university, sexually provocative pictures are not to hang in the rooms or on the doors of the rooms. Decorative alcoholic beverage containers or posters/advertisements are not allowed. The appropriateness of these items will be determined by the residence hall director or staff in the Office of Student Services. Violation of this guideline will result in having items described above confiscated.
The blinds or drapes in individual rooms are to be closed at dark. Only fireproof curtains/drapes are to be used on the room windows, according to fire marshal standards.
Additional Guidelines for Students Living in Residence Villages
Open house policy (or co-ed visitation) is in the common area and kitchenette areas ONLY. Bedrooms are excluded for opposite gender visiting. Open house visitation hours are every day from 6:00 pm-11:00 pm.
Residents are responsible for their own cleaning of their unit. Housekeeping duties will be assigned by the residence hall director and resident assistants.
Activities outside the house, in the yard or on porches are limited in respect to neighbors and within University policies.
Premium Residence Halls:
Villages, South Hall East, Broadway Hall
It is a privilege to live in one of our premium residence halls. If a student is required to be seen by the Judicial Council, Dean of Student Services, or Director of Residence Life that privilege is jeopardized.
Furniture
All furniture must remain in your room/apartment. You are responsible for any damage done to the furniture in your room/apartment. During room inspections, the RA’s will be checking to determine if all furniture is in your room. If any item is missing, you will be subject to disciplinary action and will be required to return the furniture to the room immediately. An inventory of the furnishings and the state of repair is taken at the beginning and end of each year and maintained by the residence hall director. During the first week, residents are required to complete and sign the inventory and conditions of the room and furnishings form. No furniture may be removed from the room unless permission is granted by the residence hall director. For the safety of the residents, beds are not permitted to be placed in front of windows. Residence hall staff will monitor placement of beds.
Alcohol/Drug Free Campus
As set forth in local, state and federal law, and the rules/regulations of Campbellsville University, the unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs and/or alcohol by students and employees, in buildings, facilities, grounds or other properties owned or controlled by Campbellsville University or as part of Campbellsville University activities is strictly forbidden. In addition, a student appearing on campus (including residence halls) whose use of alcoholic beverages/drugs on University related off-campus trips or group activities is strictly forbidden.
Smoke-Free Campus
Campbellsville University is a smoke-free campus which means there is no smoking anywhere on Campbellsville University premises, including all buildings and grounds.
Keys/Swipe Cards
A residence hall room key or entry swipe card is given to each resident student. That key or card is not to be duplicated and is to be turned in to the residence hall director whenever the student moves out or leaves at the end of the semester. A lost key/card or failure to turn in either at the end of the semester will result in a $50.00 charge.
Lofting
No cinder blocks are permitted in the residence halls. Raising of beds must be approved by the residence hall director. RA’s will check for compliance to this policy at each room inspection.
Security for Residence Halls
Back doors of all residence halls are locked for security reasons from 10:00 pm until 7:00 am daily. Front doors of all residence halls are locked for security purposes from 12:00 am until 7:00 am daily. Residence hall personnel will be on-duty in the main lobby of all residence halls until 12:00 am. The safety officer must open the door for late returnees after 12:00 am. Residence halls are locked from 12:00 am until 7:00 am in an effort to protect students and to keep unauthorized persons out of the residence halls.
DOORS ARE NOT TO BE PROPPED OPEN FOR REENTRY. A resident who wishes to enter the building during safety hours may do so by presenting his/her ID to the safety officer at the front door or by using his/her swipe card. Students caught propping any door will be issued a citation and a fine.
Safety Tips
Report immediately all suspicious activity or materials to the Office of Campus Safety and Security.
Always lock your residence hall room door (including deadbolt) when you leave, no matter how long you will be gone.
Always keep your vehicle doors locked and do not leave valuables visible.
Never walk alone at night; always have a partner; call the Office of Campus Safety and Security for an escort.
Never leave valuables (wallets, purses, phones, books, computers, iPods, etc.) unattended.
Record serial numbers and model numbers of all your personal items, such as TV’s, stereos, computers, etc.
Remember, most crimes committed on most campuses are crimes of opportunity. So, do not give crime the opportunity.
Security of Personal Property
In order to assure the safekeeping of personal property, student rooms must be locked at all times. The University cannot be responsible for loss of money or personal belongings within residence hall rooms or for automobile or personal property in parking lots. Efforts will be made to find items and/or investigate possible break-ins and thefts. Any missing personal items should be reported immediately to the residence hall director, the Office of Safety and Security, or the Office of Student Services for office files or police report if necessary. It is suggested that students bring locked security box to store small valuables and write initials on labels on clothing. Students are encouraged to purchase their own personal insurance coverage.
Search and Seizure
The University recognizes that a search is an intrusive action. However, the University reserves the right to conduct a search on campus at any time. This search includes the right to search vehicles on campus. The University staff seeks not to be arbitrary in performing a search; it is typically triggered out of concern about the behavioral choices of an individual or group. The University recognizes that a search risks creating a sense of disruption and distrust. A search may be conducted to dispel suspicion.
University staff members, particularly residence hall staff, in due course of carrying out their duties, are authorized to respond to any illicit item which may be in plain view anywhere on campus including student rooms and vehicles.
EXAMPLES INCLUDE: WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, AMMUNITION, FIREWORKS, ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, STOLEN PROPERTY AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. PRESENCE OF ILLICIT ITEMS/CONTRABAND IN PLAIN VIEW MAY BE USED AS PROBABLE CAUSE AND IS A GOOD AND SUFFICIENT REASON TO PERFORM A THOROUGH AND IMMEDIATE SEARCH TO SEIZE CONTRABAND.
For example, presence of alcoholic beverage containers, empty or full, in an open wastebasket may lead to a full room and/or vehicle search. Under stated guidelines for such search, regular guidelines for search and seizure apply; the principles of courtesy and privacy are to be observed in managing a search and removal of evidence in so far as this is possible.
A search typically is performed by two residence hall staff members. Although it is not a requirement for conducting a search, it is generally preferred that the resident(s) of a room be present during the search. All others will be excused. The room door is to remain closed during the search. Any search must be reported by staff to the director or residence life and dean of student services. If residents are not present at the time of the search, they are to receive written notice within 24 hours after the search is completed, listing the item(s) seized or removed from the room, and that a search was conducted. Residents are responsible for items found in their room.
A search and seizure is to be conducted with strong regard for the privacy of the student(s) involved. Alcoholic beverages/controlled substances are to be placed in unmarked, closed containers before removal from the room. Any controlled substance may be turned over to local authorities.
Firearms, weapons, bows/arrows, hunting knives, etc. are not allowed ANYWHERE on campus, including parked vehicles on campus.
Lost and Found
Any article found in the residence hall should be turned in to the residence hall director. Found articles may be claimed upon presentation of proper identification of the article and evidence of ownership. Lost articles found on campus should be turned in to the Office of Student Services.
Appropriate Dress on Campus
In order to uphold the Christian principles of Campbellsville University, the following guidelines/dress code must be followed pertaining to every student’s clothing/attire:
No shorts, skirts, or dresses shorter than the person’s finger tips when placed by their side.
No private areas are to be shown at any time, including midriff, backside, or cleavage.
Athletic clothing (sports bras, sport specific shorts, etc.) must only be worn inside athletic areas. Athletic clothing must abide by all other dress code criteria.
No undergarments may show at any time.
Pants must be worn at waist level.
No swim suits worn outside of the swimming pool area.
No clothing that advertises drugs or alcohol, or is sexually provocative.
Clothing should be worn when going from showers to room.
Laundry Facilities
Washers and dryers are located in each residence hall for residents’ use. Coin operated machines are supplied and serviced by JETZ, a national laundry service to colleagues and universities. THE FACILITIES ARE TO BE USED BY THE RESPECTIVE RESIDENCE HALL STUDENTS ONLY! Washing clothes for people other than persons who live in the residence halls is not allowed. Students using the laundry machines should be considerate of others and clean off the washer when finished and remove lint from lint filter of dryer. Abuse and/or breakdowns should be reported immediately to the residence hall director. Do not leave wash unattended. Clothes found in or on top of a washer/dryer over a 24-hour period will be discarded.
Pets
No pets or experimental animals are allowed in the residence halls. Aquariums, with fish only, are allowed with the permission of the residence hall director. Aquariums must contain fresh water and be kept clean. Violators will have 24 hours to remove an animal from the premises.
Bicycles
Students are allowed to have bicycles on campus. Students are responsible for locking/securing their bikes on campus bike racks ONLY. Bicycles parked in unauthorized areas will be removed by the Office of Security. Bicycles NOT claimed by the end of the spring semester will be considered abandoned property.
Skateboards, Scooters and Roller Blades.
For the safety of all students, the use of skateboards, scooters and roller blades is strictly prohibited on any surfaces other than public streets and sidewalks. Any surfaces owned by Campbellsville University are restricted from use of these modes of transportation. This includes all sidewalks and paved areas within the Campbellsville University campus.
Damages
Each room is inspected before, during and after occupancy and charges for damage (other than normal wear) are assigned to the student. Failure to pay will result in a student’s being UNABLE TO MAKE A ROOM RESERVATION FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER OR TO SECURE A TRANSCRIPT. Damage caused by accidents should be reported immediately to the residence hall director.
Damages in the residence halls will be charged to the person or persons responsible. A floor will be charged for damages resulting from group action or unidentified source. Each resident will be responsible for damages in his/her room unless another responsible party is identified. A cost sheet will be provided to each student upon checking into his/her room.
Hearing Impaired Residents
Students who have a hearing problem are required by state law to have a notice on the outside of their room stating “Hearing Impaired Student.”
Guests
Overnight guests must be pre-approved and registered with the residence hall director at least 24 hours before they arrive.

Quiet Hours
In order for residence hall space to best meet the needs of all students, all residents must show strong consideration for their neighbors’ personal needs for quiet in order to study and rest.
Quiet hours apply to the following behavior:
Loud stereos and televisions in your room or lounge area.
Speakers placed against walls that separate you from your neighbor’s room.
Loud conversation or laughter in your room, lounge or hallways.
Running in residence halls creating a safety hazard, disruption and a problem for others.

Quiet hours are from 11:00pm to 10:00am every day of the week. A 24-hour quiet period will be enforced during mid-term and final exam weeks. A quiet hour policy is set by the residence hall council with advice and consent from the dean of student services. It is a vital courtesy to respect other students’ rights to peace and quiet at all hours of the day.
Music in Rooms
Consideration of roommate and neighbors in regard to your music must prevail. A student may not play a musical instrument in the residence halls without permission from the residence hall director and/or neighbors. Practicing of band instruments must be done in the Gosser Fine Arts Center. Students with stereos must play them in a way so as not to invade other students’ privacy.

Smoking and Use of Tobacco Products
Campbellsville University realizes the health risks involved in smoking and use of tobacco products. Therefore, in compliance with federal guidelines for a smoke-free environment, smoking and use of tobacco products are strictly prohibited in all residence halls and campus buildings and grounds. Violators will be subject to residence hall/judicial sanctions.
Fire Protection Equipment
Planned fire drills will be conducted periodically for the safety of the residents. Fire equipment is located in the residence halls for emergency use only. Any person who tampers with or handles any part of the fire alarm or firefighting equipment other than for legitimate fire protection will be fined $500.00. All members of a group will be charged for damages resulting from group action. Charges will be made to the occupants of that area if the responsible party is not identified.
When a fire alarm sounds in the residence halls, it automatically alerts the local fire department. Fire officials will come on campus, evacuate the building and search for possible fire. Houses and other campus buildings must be called in by dialing 911 immediately at the sound of the fire alarm.
In addition to the University’s policy regarding false fire alarms, a full investigation may be performed by the fire department officials as they deem necessary. This act (false fire alarm) is covered by the Kentucky Revised Statutes 508.080, which is a class D misdemeanor.
Residence Hall Citations
Citations are given for minor offenses that occur in the residence halls to discourage inappropriate behavior. The citations may be given by resident assistants (RAs) and/or the residence hall director. With the first offense a verbal warning will be given; after two citations, a fine of $10.00 will be issued; a third citation within the same semester will result in a $25.00 fine. With a fourth citation, the student will appear before the residence hall council, and a possible $50.00 fine could be sanctioned.
Offenses for which citations may be given include, but are not limited to:
Disrespect for residence hall director and/or RAs; refusing to obey requests; talking back, etc.
Use of lewd, profane, foul language or cursing.
Failure to pass room check.
Missed floor or residence hall meeting.

Windows
Visiting through residence hall windows can be disturbing to other residents. Students are not permitted to sit on ledges or windowsills. Students may not throw objects out of windows or at a building. Students may not use windows as a means of entry or as a place to gain someone’s attention. Talking to anyone from your window is not permitted from dark until noon each day. For cosmetic purposes, nothing is permitted to be hung in the windows.
Residence Halls Closed Between Semesters
Students will not be allowed to stay in the residence halls during Christmas break (between fall and spring semesters), spring break, or between summer school and the fall semester (end of July to the third week of August). Special permission must be obtained from the director of residence life two weeks prior to closing to remain in residence halls during these times. A fee of $15.00 per night will be charged to the student’s account. All belongings must be removed from residence hall rooms after the spring semester and summer sessions to allow for adequate cleaning and use by other groups. Storage facilities are not provided during these break periods. The Winters Dining Hall will be closed and students will be responsible for their meals during these interims.
Athletes or international students needing to stay additional days past the end of semesters or return early before residence halls officially open, must have their coach or international student advisor send written requests to the Office of Student Services 10 days prior to the additional days needed before or at the end of the semester.
Unauthorized Solicitation and Selling
Any form of unauthorized selling or solicitation or door-to-door distribution of materials, including surveys, questionnaires, etc., is not allowed. Student organizations must obtain permission from the Office of Student Services to sponsor a fundraiser.
Approval from the vice president for development is also needed to conduct a fundraiser in the community. No student is allowed to use the University property/facilities to conduct private business enterprises.
Proper Trash Disposal
Each resident is responsible for removal of trash to the dumpster on a weekly basis. All trash should be contained in bags and placed in these receptacles. All trash cans must have liners. This applies to end-of-semester periods as well. Place trash and unwanted items in trash cans, not in hallways. Do not use trash cans as doorstops or to hold outside doors or fire doors open. The hall cleaning staff will provide extra trash bags at the end of semesters if needed.
