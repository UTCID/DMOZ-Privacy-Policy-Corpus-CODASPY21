OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

They have been included with express permission of the copyright owner. You are permitted to view the Content for your personal and non-commercial use only.

The National Conference of Bar Examiners provides certain Civil Procedure sample questions as an educational tool for candidates seeking admission to the bar within a U.S. jurisdiction.
These sample questions are very similar in format to the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), and are intended to familiarize candidates with Civil Procedure MBE-style questions.
While these sample questions illustrate the kinds of Civil Procedure questions that will appear on the MBE starting in February 2015, they do not represent all the Civil Procedure material that will be covered.
