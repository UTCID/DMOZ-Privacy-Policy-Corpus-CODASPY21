SportsWar Terms of Use
By becoming a Subscriber to SportsWar’s subscription services, or by using this site (hereinafter the “Site”), which is a part of the SportsWar Network, you agree to be bound by the terms of service listed herein. These terms of service are subject to change or update by SportsWar at any time without notice to you.
Message Boards
The accepted standards of conduct in our message board communities are determined by the publishing partner of any given site. Subscribers and registered users agree that SportsWar and its publishing partners have the right to enforce these standards, including deletion of posts, blacklisting/banning users, or removing access to premium message boards with no refund to the Subscriber.
Behavior that is restricted on the message boards may include, but is not limited to:
Posts containing discussion of race, religion, or politics.
Personal attacks or insults on ANYONE (including athletes, recruits, coaches or administrators, other users of the boards, beat writers, Site staff, et al).
Material which defames (slanders), abuses or threatens others.
Statements that are bigoted, hateful or racially offensive.
Posts containing negative comments about Site sponsors.
Material that advocates illegal activity or discusses illegal activities with the intent to commit them.
Posts with the sole intent of eliciting negative responses (flaming).
Rumors concerning individual’s private lives, when said rumors are not a matter of public record.
Excessive numbers of posts. If you’re “living” on the boards, posting every 2-3 minutes, and getting in heated discussions with numerous other posters, this will be considered a violation of these Terms of Use.
Repeated “pot-stirring,” or always being the center of controversy on the boards. If you post in a fashion that otherwise abides by the terms of service, but which continually raises the ire of the message board community, this may be considered a violation of these Terms of Use.
Unauthorized copyrighted material, including such items as scans of copyrighted material or posts of subscription-based web articles.
Material that contains vulgar, obscene or indecent language or images, including posting vulgar words with characters such as $ or * substituted for strategic letters.
Posts containing embedded pictures that are pornographic in nature, or links to pornographic web sites. Other sexually suggestive pictures and links to inappropriate web sites may also be deleted.
Advertising or any form of commercial solicitation. This includes posting links to eBay auctions,, or links to commercial web sites posted by individuals who are affiliated with said web site and are seeking to direct traffic to their web site from this message board (i.e., “spamming the message board”). If in doubt as to whether or not your post is a solicitation or “spam,” please email Site staff for clarification.
Posts or posting habits which are otherwise deemed inappropriate by Site staff.
By signing up to post on SportsWar’s message boards, you agree that you will not use the message boards to advertise any product or service, without the express written permission of SportsWar. You also agree that if you do use the message boards in such a manner, and are subsequently banned or blacklisted from the message boards, and then continue to post such advertising under a new account, you will be liable for damages to SportsWar in the amount of fair compensation for equivalent advertising frequently sold by SportsWar to other advertisers, plus SportsWar’s costs of collection, including attorneys fees. Due to difficulty in SportsWar assessing these damages and advertising opportunity costs, you agree that the minimum damage from violation of this provision will be $10,000 (without limitation on SportsWar’s ability to prove actual damages in excess of this amount).
By signing up to post on SportsWar’ message boards, you agree that if SportsWar blacklists you, you will cease and desist from posting on the message boards. If you are blacklisted, and subsequently sign up under new account(s) for the sole purpose of disrupting the message boards in any manner, you will be liable for damages to SportsWar in the amount of fair compensation for time spent by SportsWar staff and/or publishers in addition to any lost profits or revenues caused by your disruption and costs of collection of these damages, including attorneys fees. Due to difficulty in SportsWar assessing these damages and costs, you agree that the minimum damage from violation of this provision will be $10,000 (without limitation on SportsWar’ ability to prove actual damages in excess of this amount).
By subscribing, registering or using the sites, you agree that SportsWar and or the publisher(s) and board moderators of the sites have the right, in addition to other rights, to delete your posts or blacklist you or any other user at any time, if they believe that action is in the best interest of the sites, for whatever reason, and the reason need not be disclosed.
Payment Obligation and Credit Card Authorization
All subscription/membership fees are non-refundable.
The Subscriber is responsible for paying periodic subscription fees, and hereby authorizes SportsWar to charge the subscriber’s credit card, debit card, or bank account, to pay for the ongoing cost of subscriptions/membership fees via automatic debit.

Unless specifically stated, subscribers will be automatically renewed for a term equal to the original term upon expiration of the then-current term, and continually thereafter, unless the Subscriber terminates the subscription via the web site. When termination is requested by a Subscriber, there is no refund for any unused portion of the current subscription.
Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the authorization to charge Subscriber’s credit card for services shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of Service for substantially similar services at the same website. Subscriber may not assign or transfer his or her subscription to any other person or entity. Should Subscriber request a refund which is denied for a valid reason under these Terms of Service, and should Subscriber subsequently file a claim against SportsWar, SportsWar shall be entitled to collect from Subscriber all costs (including attorneys fees) associated with defending such a claim.
By subscribing, you agree that you will be responsible for all payments as specified, and you agree that SportsWar may adjust the pricing of subscription plans, without notice or other communication to you.
