Privacy Policy
Commitment to Individual Privacy
Western Colorado University is committed to protecting the privacy and accuracy of confidential information submitted by employees, students, and visitors to our website. We do not actively share personal information gathered. However, because Western Colorado University is a public institution, some information collected from the Western Colorado University website may be subject to the Colorado Public (Open) Records Act. Thus, in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our Web servers. This may include server log information, email messages sent to an individual identified on the website, and information collected from Web-based forms.
Colorado Public (Open) Records Act (C.R.S. 24-72 201 et seq.)
It is the declared public policy of the State of Colorado that all public records shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as otherwise provided by law. Public Records are defined by this law as all writings made or maintained by a state institution, such as Western Colorado University, regardless of the format or medium of the records.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. §1232g)
Western Colorado University also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which generally prohibits the release of students’ education records without consent. FERPA only applies to currently enrolled students. A brief outline of this policy is printed annually in the Student Handbook or the entire FERPA Act may be found online at http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/reg/ferpa/index.html

This information is used to help diagnose problems, assess what information is of most interest, determine technical design specifications, identify system performance and/or problem areas, and other administration functions. You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to Western Colorado University via the Internet. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of Western Colorado University’s websites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
