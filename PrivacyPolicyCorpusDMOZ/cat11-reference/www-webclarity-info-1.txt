Learn about Alternative Services with the self-service mini-library NovelBranch
Dec 8,2020
-
Time:
10:00 am - 10:45 am
Offered in cooperation with our sister company, Convergent Library Technology, this session will show you how customers have deployed NovelBranch pre- and post-COVID to meet the changing needs of their patrons.  From Browse & Borrow to Holds Pick-up,  we'll discuss how NovelBranch can work for your community.  We will discuss RFID technology and how even if you are not using RFID to circulate your collection, you can still use NovelBranch.  We'll provide real world examples and give a live demonstration.
If your Library is struggling to offer services to certain members of your community, then bring your lunch and join us online to learn how our affordable, easy to deploy self-service mini-library can be a positive impact to your community and be an engaging visual reminder of what your Library offers.

PeopleWhere - COVID-19 screening form, attendance tracking
Dec 3,2020
-
Time:
1:00 pm - 1:45 pm
This short webinar will take you through two key features in PeopleWhere relevant for the current health crisis we are facing: our survey tool and our attendance module. (Scroll to register below or call 1-866-213-8880 x113)
We'll walk you through the new survey tool in PeopleWhere and demonstrate the default COVID-19 screening questionnaire, it's settings and how to view and report on responses.     We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis and many of our communities are entering a second or even a third pandemic wave.  Many libraries  face real struggles in ensuring health guidelines are followed to keep staff and customers safe and facilities open.  Your local state or provincial health authorities may mandate COVID-19 screening questionnaires be completed by staff before entering your facility.  Our screening questionnaire feature will free up your team from having to produce paper screening forms, collecting them, collating the data in them, reporting the data and storing the forms.
We'll also review the Attendance module and demonstrate how it can quickly be set-up for staff to Sign-in and Sign-out from their shift.  We'll show you how to generate reports that illustrate who was in the building at a given time frame through their sign-in and sign-out timestamps.  We'll take a quick look at how you can set the system up to notify you if someone hasn't signed in or out (this requires that person to be in the Schedule).  Bottom line, this module can help you track easily which staff are in your facilities and when.
If you are not a PeopleWhere customer, but are interested in how these two features could help your Library, please contact Allison at sales@webclarity.ca, 1-866-213-8880 x113.

PeopleWhere's Attendance module - free customer training
Oct 7,2016
-
Time:
11:30 am - 12:00 pm
This webinar will provide an overview of how the new PeopleWhere attendance module works both from a regular staff and manager perspective, and show you how to configure it and be up and running in just a couple settings. We'll cover how staff sign-in and sign-out and add explanatory notes. We'll show you how the new reports work and how managers with the correct permissions can adjust timestamps. If not all staff are required to sign-in/sign-out, we'll show you how to configure the module to restrict this feature to certain staff types only. And if you have staff that work in different locations and you want them to sign-in and out as they move from one to the other, we'll show you how to enable that feature too. Lastly, the system can send a variety of alerts to tell if a staff arrived late, didn't show up at all or left early. So, we'll show how and where that is configured. Bring your lunch and join us!

Time:

Within every library organization are experts, well trained, highly skilled staff.  How are you keeping tracking of these important assets?  By identifying key knowledge and skills, you better position your team for providing enhanced service to your patrons today, but you are also far better able to plan for your ongoing and future staff competency and educational needs.   This free session will explore all the various areas in PeopleWhere related to this module, from defining categories and assets, to reports that show you the expiry dates for First Aid certifications, to finding a staff person who speaks Syrian and where they are working, and finally how Knowledge Assets can be used in scheduling to help select the most appropriate staff for shifts.

Learn about Alternative Services with the self-service mini-library NovelBranch
Dec 8,2020
-
Time:
10:00 am - 10:45 am
Offered in cooperation with our sister company, Convergent Library Technology, this session will show you how customers have deployed NovelBranch pre- and post-COVID to meet the changing needs of their patrons.  From Browse & Borrow to Holds Pick-up,  we'll discuss how NovelBranch can work for your community.  We will discuss RFID technology and how even if you are not using RFID to circulate your collection, you can still use NovelBranch.  We'll provide real world examples and give a live demonstration.
If your Library is struggling to offer services to certain members of your community, then bring your lunch and join us online to learn how our affordable, easy to deploy self-service mini-library can be a positive impact to your community and be an engaging visual reminder of what your Library offers.

PeopleWhere - COVID-19 screening form, attendance tracking
Dec 3,2020
-
Time:
1:00 pm - 1:45 pm
This short webinar will take you through two key features in PeopleWhere relevant for the current health crisis we are facing: our survey tool and our attendance module. (Scroll to register below or call 1-866-213-8880 x113)
We'll walk you through the new survey tool in PeopleWhere and demonstrate the default COVID-19 screening questionnaire, it's settings and how to view and report on responses.     We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis and many of our communities are entering a second or even a third pandemic wave.  Many libraries  face real struggles in ensuring health guidelines are followed to keep staff and customers safe and facilities open.  Your local state or provincial health authorities may mandate COVID-19 screening questionnaires be completed by staff before entering your facility.  Our screening questionnaire feature will free up your team from having to produce paper screening forms, collecting them, collating the data in them, reporting the data and storing the forms.
We'll also review the Attendance module and demonstrate how it can quickly be set-up for staff to Sign-in and Sign-out from their shift.  We'll show you how to generate reports that illustrate who was in the building at a given time frame through their sign-in and sign-out timestamps.  We'll take a quick look at how you can set the system up to notify you if someone hasn't signed in or out (this requires that person to be in the Schedule).  Bottom line, this module can help you track easily which staff are in your facilities and when.
If you are not a PeopleWhere customer, but are interested in how these two features could help your Library, please contact Allison at sales@webclarity.ca, 1-866-213-8880 x113.

Time:
11:30 am - 12:00 pm
This webinar will provide an overview of how the new PeopleWhere attendance module works both from a regular staff and manager perspective, and show you how to configure it and be up and running in just a couple settings. We'll cover how staff sign-in and sign-out and add explanatory notes. We'll show you how the new reports work and how managers with the correct permissions can adjust timestamps. If not all staff are required to sign-in/sign-out, we'll show you how to configure the module to restrict this feature to certain staff types only. And if you have staff that work in different locations and you want them to sign-in and out as they move from one to the other, we'll show you how to enable that feature too. Lastly, the system can send a variety of alerts to tell if a staff arrived late, didn't show up at all or left early. So, we'll show how and where that is configured. Bring your lunch and join us!

Learn about Alternative Services with the self-service mini-library NovelBranch
Dec 8,2020
-
Time:
10:00 am - 10:45 am
Offered in cooperation with our sister company, Convergent Library Technology, this session will show you how customers have deployed NovelBranch pre- and post-COVID to meet the changing needs of their patrons.  From Browse & Borrow to Holds Pick-up,  we'll discuss how NovelBranch can work for your community.  We will discuss RFID technology and how even if you are not using RFID to circulate your collection, you can still use NovelBranch.  We'll provide real world examples and give a live demonstration.
If your Library is struggling to offer services to certain members of your community, then bring your lunch and join us online to learn how our affordable, easy to deploy self-service mini-library can be a positive impact to your community and be an engaging visual reminder of what your Library offers.

PeopleWhere - COVID-19 screening form, attendance tracking
Dec 3,2020
-
Time:
1:00 pm - 1:45 pm
This short webinar will take you through two key features in PeopleWhere relevant for the current health crisis we are facing: our survey tool and our attendance module. (Scroll to register below or call 1-866-213-8880 x113)
We'll walk you through the new survey tool in PeopleWhere and demonstrate the default COVID-19 screening questionnaire, it's settings and how to view and report on responses.     We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis and many of our communities are entering a second or even a third pandemic wave.  Many libraries  face real struggles in ensuring health guidelines are followed to keep staff and customers safe and facilities open.  Your local state or provincial health authorities may mandate COVID-19 screening questionnaires be completed by staff before entering your facility.  Our screening questionnaire feature will free up your team from having to produce paper screening forms, collecting them, collating the data in them, reporting the data and storing the forms.
We'll also review the Attendance module and demonstrate how it can quickly be set-up for staff to Sign-in and Sign-out from their shift.  We'll show you how to generate reports that illustrate who was in the building at a given time frame through their sign-in and sign-out timestamps.  We'll take a quick look at how you can set the system up to notify you if someone hasn't signed in or out (this requires that person to be in the Schedule).  Bottom line, this module can help you track easily which staff are in your facilities and when.
If you are not a PeopleWhere customer, but are interested in how these two features could help your Library, please contact Allison at sales@webclarity.ca, 1-866-213-8880 x113.

PeopleWhere's Attendance module - free customer training
Oct 7,2016

Time:
11:30 am - 12:00 pm
This webinar will provide an overview of how the new PeopleWhere attendance module works both from a regular staff and manager perspective, and show you how to configure it and be up and running in just a couple settings. We'll cover how staff sign-in and sign-out and add explanatory notes. We'll show you how the new reports work and how managers with the correct permissions can adjust timestamps. If not all staff are required to sign-in/sign-out, we'll show you how to configure the module to restrict this feature to certain staff types only. And if you have staff that work in different locations and you want them to sign-in and out as they move from one to the other, we'll show you how to enable that feature too. Lastly, the system can send a variety of alerts to tell if a staff arrived late, didn't show up at all or left early. So, we'll show how and where that is configured. Bring your lunch and join us!

MARC editing - made easy with macros in BookWhere Suite
Mar 8,2016
-
Time:
1:00 pm - 2:00 pm
This session is great for users who have only ever used BookWhere's record search and retrieval functionality but who are thinking of making the jump to using the MARC editing feature.
It's also good for users who have been using the full Suite features but haven't had a chance to explore its capabilities as an efficient pre-processing cataloging tool.
We'll review how to:
set up macros
define a default macro to run automatically
use macros to edit batches of records
use the different MARC record editors to edit individual tags
add tags to the Validation process
