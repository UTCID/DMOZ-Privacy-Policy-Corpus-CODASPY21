The student is not automatically added to a course wait list unless the student makes this request. For enrollment through WebReg, the student will be prompted to be placed on a wait list.  If they are registering by paper, the Registrar’s Office staff will check the class and if the class is closed, they will put the student on the wait list.A student may not register for a section of a course and be placed on a wait list for another section of the same course; however a student may be wait-listed for multiple sections of the same course.A priority is given based on the criteria set up by program directors. In many cases wait lists are determined by class level and time of wait-listing.It should never be assumed that a wait-listed course results in official registration.  Students should work with their mentor/advisor to select alternate courses in case the wait-listed course remains full. A student on a wait list is not officially enrolled in that course and thus is not eligible to receive a grade in that course.Once a spot on the wait list opens, the first student will be notified via email that they may register for the course.  The student has 24 hours to respond; otherwise the open spot will roll to the next student.Any student with a financial hold will not be allowed to enroll in a course from the wait list.Additional Policies for Traditional Undergraduate StudentsCourse wait lists are maintained through the end of the second week of the semester; after the second week of the semester, a wait-listed student must follow the university’s add-drop procedure in seeking permission of the instructor to enroll in the course.A student on a wait list may attend the wait-listed course for two weeks, if seating is available and if the instructor gives permission, in the hope that a space will become available for that student to register.The decision to add a student to the course after the second week of the semester rests entirely with the course instructor. If the instructor decides to allow additional students to enroll in the course, it is highly recommended that s/he enroll students from the wait list before considering other students who may not have been on the wait list during the first two weeks of the course. The instructor may consider a range of factors, including availability of space in the classroom; other teaching obligations; the student’s capabilities and past performance; and the student’s learning/degree-completion goals.After the last day for enrolling or adding a course (see the Academic Calendar section of this catalog), a student who is not officially enrolled in the course (based on the official class roster through the My Services tab on CampusCruiser) is not allowed to participate in the course and will not have a grade recorded on his or her transcript for that course.Additional Policies For Degree Completion StudentsCourse wait lists are maintained through the first day of class.Waitlisted students may not attend class.Registrar's OfficePhone: 559-453-2037 Fax: 559-453-3676 registrar@fresno.eduPhone HoursMon - Fri: 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:00a.m. - 12:00p.m.Office HoursMon - Fri: 8:30a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:30a.m. - 12:00p.m.StudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentral
