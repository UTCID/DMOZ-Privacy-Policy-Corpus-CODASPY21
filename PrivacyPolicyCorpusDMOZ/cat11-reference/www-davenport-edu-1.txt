Use of Cookies
The Davenport University Website use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Davenport University pages, or register with Davenport University site or services, a cookie helps Davenport University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses and so on. When you return to the same Davenport University Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Davenport University features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Davenport University services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
Davenport University secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Davenport University secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
Davenport University will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Davenport University encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Davenport University is protecting your information.
