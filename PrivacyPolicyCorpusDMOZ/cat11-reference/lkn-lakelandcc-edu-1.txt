What is my Lakeland ID?
What is my Lakeland ID?Get to Know Your Lakeland ID # (LID)
To help protect your privacy, Lakeland Community College has assigned a Lakeland ID number (LID) to you. This number is a different number than your social security number. The number is eight digits and starts with two zeroes. For example: 00xxxxxx
This personal number will be yours forever.
How do I find out what my LID is?
It will be printed on all of your schedules, financial aid notices, and tuition bills where your social security number was previously printed as well as on the bottom portion of your schedule, which is used to pay tuition.
What if I forget my LID?
We do not release your LID# without photo verification of identity. Here are the standard options for students in this situation:
Present a photo ID at the Admissions Office and you will be given your LID number.
