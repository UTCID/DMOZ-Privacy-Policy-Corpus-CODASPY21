Terms And Conditions Of Use
Please Read These Terms And Conditions Of Use Carefully Before Using This Site. By using this site, you signify your assent to these terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms of use, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these terms at any time. Please check these terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of GUITAR9.COM and GUITARNINE.COM following the posting of changes to these terms (including the GUITAR NINE Privacy Policy) will mean you accept those changes.
Restrictions On Use Of Materials
This site is owned and operated by GUITAR NINE (referred to as "GUITAR NINE," "we," "us," or "our" herein). No material from GUITAR9.COM or any Web site owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by GUITAR NINE may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way, except that you may download one copy of the materials on any single computer for your personal, non-commercial home use only, provided you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices. Modification of the materials or use of the materials for any other purpose is a violation of GUITAR NINE's copyright and other proprietary rights.

In the event you download software from the site, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by GUITAR NINE. GUITAR NINE does not transfer title to the Software to you. You own the medium on which the Software is recorded, but GUITAR NINE retains full and complete title to the Software, and all intellectual property rights therein.

Submissions
GUITAR NINE is pleased to hear from its loyal fans and welcomes your comments regarding GUITAR NINE products, including GUITAR NINE's online services. Unfortunately, however, GUITAR NINE's company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested, such as The Undiscovered program and the Merchandising Program.
We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings.. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those other than those GUITAR NINE has specifically requested.
If, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials (with the exception of submissions we have requested, such as material for Undiscovered Artists review, the merchandising program, e-mails, or orders), you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions") without a written agreement, the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of GUITAR NINE. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of GUITAR NINE, and GUITAR NINE shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, GUITAR NINE shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.

You shall not upload to, distribute through, or otherwise publish through GUITAR9.COM and GUITARNINE.COM any content which is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise give rise to liability or violates any law.
The Forums shall be used only in a noncommercial manner. You shall not, without our express approval, distribute or otherwise publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services. You specifically acknowledge that soliciting other GUITAR NINE visitors to join or become members of any commercial online service or other organization is expressly prohibited.
It is our policy to respect the privacy of all visitors. Therefore, in addition to the privacy of customer data (see our Privacy Policy), we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a visitor's e-mail unless required in the course of normal maintenance of GUITAR9.COM and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on GUITAR NINE; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of GUITAR NINE; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our visitors or the public. Visitors shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages.
