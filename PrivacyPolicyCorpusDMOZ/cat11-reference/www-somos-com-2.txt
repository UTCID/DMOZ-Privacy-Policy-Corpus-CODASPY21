Anonymized data and aggregated data from which data about an identifiable person cannot be obtained is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
“Site” means the websites: somos.com, texting.somos.com, secure-auction.somos.com, and any other website, URL, or electronic or mobile device application owned or operated by or on behalf of a Somos Company or in connection with a Somos Product, either now or in the future.

Third Party Websites and Applications
The Somos Products and/or Sites may contain links to other websites or applications. The Somos Companies are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third-party websites or applications. Users should be aware of this when leaving the Somos Products or Sites and review the privacy statements on the third-party sites or applications. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by or on behalf of the Somos Companies.
What Information Do We Collect?
The Somos Companies, or third parties acting on behalf of the Somos Companies, collect both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, both directly, in your interaction with the Sites or Somos Products, and indirectly through the use of Tracking Technology.
The Personal Information we collect may include but is not limited to: your name and corporate title, your IP address, the name of your company, your telephone number, company address, email address, as well as any additional supplemental information that we may request from time to time.
The User Data we collect may include, but is not limited to: your industry group, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer and exit websites and applications, browser type, browser language, operating system, geographic location, date and time of your queries and search queries. We may also collect information with respect to the interaction between you and our Sites or Somos Products, including but not limited to date and time of your visit, length of your visit and pages viewed, your typing patterns, interactions with our website such as mouse clicks or touches on your touch screen, your answers to questions including those used to verify that you are not a robot, the plug-ins installed on your browser.  This information is Personal Information if it is capable of being associated with you.
RouteLink Users: Somos may require additional information, including without limitation, Operating Company Number (OCN) registration numbers, evidence of state operator authorization and insurance certificates, for the purpose of verifying that you satisfy Somos’ requirements to receive access to the RouteLink routing database. An authorized distributor of RouteLink may also be required to submit information related to its customers, such as the customers’ organization names, OCN registration numbers, evidence of state operator authorization, insurance certificates, addresses, contact persons, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers, for the limited purpose of satisfying Somos’ requirements for the provision of RouteLink services to such customers. Such RouteLink User Data shall be considered User Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
TSS Registry Users: Somos may require additional information about Service Registrars’ customers to validate with a Responsible Organization (as that term is defined in the Tariff) the requesting User information. It is the responsibility of the Service Registrars to obtain appropriate permission from their customers to provide such information.
Auction Users: Participation in auctions will require you to provide additional information, including without limitation, credit card numbers or banking account information, to a third-party payment processor. All information provided to such third-party processor will be governed by such processor’s terms and conditions and privacy policy, over which Somos has no control and for which Somos has no responsibility. However, to the extent the third-party processor provides information to Somos, for example, for the purpose of verifying that you have created an account with the third-party processor, the information in Somos’ possession will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
Use and Disclosure of Information We Collect
User Data: Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide Users with the best and most useful Content and services, to manage the use of the Somos Products and the Site by its Users, and to communicate with you, our service providers and agents, and other Users. We use the information to create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve the Somos Products and services, Content, advertising and marketing materials. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Somos Companies use User Data only for Somos Companies’ purposes and will not disclose User Data to any third parties, unless we are required to do so by law, regulation or court order, or with your consent.
Personal Information: From time to time, we may use your Personal Information to send you important notices, such as communications related to the Sites, the Somos Products and services, the Somos Companies, and changes to our terms, conditions and policies. Your Personal Information may be aggregated and used to help us improve the Somos Products and services and to better understand which Somos Products or services are of most interest to our Users.
TSS Registry Users: The TSS Registry allows Responsible Organizations (as that term is defined in the Tariff) to view User Data for the limited purpose of facilitating Responsible Organization approvals to text-enable toll-free numbers.
Auction Users: The Auction allows Responsible Organizations (as that term is defined in the Tariff) to view User Data for the limited purpose of facilitating Responsible Organization approvals in connection with the sale and purchase of a toll-free number in the Auction.
User-Generated Content: The Somos Products or Sites may feature User-generated content, such as in review sections, blogs or forum communities. Unless otherwise indicated, information provided by Users on such forums is not private and may be visible to other visitors to the Sites and any User.
Disclosure to Service Providers: Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or in agreements with Users, we may share, sell, license or transfer User Data to Somos Company service providers, agents, or other third parties engaged by Somos for the purpose of providing, supporting and improving the Somos Products and Sites.
Storage and Deletion: The Somos Companies store and process User Data in the United States, and your User Data may therefore be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in the United States. We reserve the right to store User Data as long as may be permitted by applicable laws and regulations. We will delete your Personal Information if you ask us to do so by contacting the Somos Help Desk at 844-HEY-SOMOS (844-439-7666), unless we are required to retain it under any applicable laws or regulations.
Improper Conduct: We may use and share User Data to investigate and help prevent unlawful activity or activity that threatens our network or otherwise jeopardizes the provision or operation of any of the Somos Products. We may disclose User Data to third parties (such as law enforcement) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is needed to help prevent unlawful activity or any activity that threatens any Sites, Somos Companies or Somos Products.
Tracking Technology: The Somos Products, email communications, advertisements, marketing materials and other interactive applications or services may use Tracking Technology. Tracking Technology helps us to better understand which parts of our Sites and Somos Products Users use and visit and to facilitate and measure the effectiveness of any Somos Company advertisements, surveys, functions, promotions or other Content. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy or pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, information collected by Tracking Technology is considered Non-Personal Information.
The Somos Companies may use cookies and other technologies to remember Personal Information and other User Data when you use the Somos Products or Sites. You should only access the Sites using web browsers that enable you to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. If you reject our cookies, some functions and conveniences of the Somos Products or Sites may not work properly.
The Somos Companies may send email messages, text messages, “push” notifications or other similar advertising and marketing materials from time to time which may include a “click-through URL” linked to a Site or Somos Product. We, or third parties on our behalf, may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications to you. We may also include “pixel tags” or other similar technologies in the email messages, text messages or notifications that tell us whether our message has been opened or notification received. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to you and other Users. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click the text or graphic links in the messages or notifications.
The Somos Products, Somos Companies and its service providers, and third parties such as ad networks, may use cross-device/cross-context tracking. For example, if you use multiple browsers on a single device, or use various devices (such as desktops, smartphones, and tablets) to access the Somos Products or communicate with the Somos Companies, it may result in your having multiple accounts or profiles across these various contexts and devices. Cross-device/cross-context technology may be used to connect these various accounts or profiles and the corresponding data from the different contexts and devices.
Do Not Track: The Somos Companies and its service providers, including ad networks, may use your browsing history across participating websites or use of mobile devices to show you interest-based advertisements. Currently, our Site, the Somos Products and our other services do not recognize if your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads.
How Can You Opt Out of Use and Disclosure of Your Information?
We will only use your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to opt out of receiving information about the Somos Products or other Somos Company information you may opt-out of receiving emails from the Somos Companies at any time by contacting the Somos Help Desk at 844-HEY-SOMOS (844-439-7666) or as indicated in your User account settings. We will, at your request, delete your information from our database at any time by contacting the Somos Help Desk at 844-HEY-SOMOS (844-439-7666) unless we are required to retain it under any applicable laws or regulations.
