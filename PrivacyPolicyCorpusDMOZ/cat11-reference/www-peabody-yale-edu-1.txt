The Yale Peabody Museum is committed to providing broad access to its collections for teaching, learning and research. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of these digital assets requires written permission or consent from the rights holder, and for responding to any claims that may arise from your use. In some cases, content may be in the public domain. In other cases, there may be copyright, publicity and privacy rights, or other proprietary rights, held by individuals or entities other than, or in addition to, the Yale Peabody Museum. By using the materials contained on this site, you agree and warrant that your use will not violate the rights of the Yale Peabody Museum or any other person or entity. Copyright Ownership The Yale Peabody Museum is the owner of the compilation of the data, digital assets, software, code, documentation, text, design elements and other information contained in its web services. Unless otherwise stated, the Yale Peabody Museum retains all rights, copyright and other proprietary rights in content found in its web services. In some cases, copyright or other proprietary rights to content contained on the website may be held by individuals or entities other than, or in addition to, the Yale Peabody Museum. In still other cases the content may be in the public domain. Fair Use The Peabody welcomes your fair use of copyrighted Yale Peabody Museum materials as defined by United States copyright law. The United States copyright law contains an exception for fair use of copyrighted materials, which includes the use of protected materials for certain purposes of teaching, scholarship, research, criticism, commentary, and news reporting. Accordingly, users may download these files for their personal or educational use, subject to any additional terms or restrictions, which may be applicable to the individual file or data. For guidelines on the fair use exception, please refer to the United States Copyright Office. Please also refer to the rights information in the record for each item. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use constitutes fair use, and for responding to any claims that may arise from your use. Commercial Use If you wish to use any copyrighted materials or content from Yale Peabody Museum web services for any purpose other than fair use as defined by law, you must request and receive prior written permission for your intended use from the copyright holder. The copyright holder is usually the author of the material or the author’s heirs or assigns. You are solely responsible for determining whether the Yale Peabody Museum or some other party holds the relevant rights in any content you may wish to use, for investigating the ownership of the copyright, and for obtaining permission for your intended use. The Yale Peabody Museum will have no responsibility for making any such determination, or in securing rights from a third party, for any user. The Yale Peabody Museum does not warrant that the use of the materials displayed on its web services will not infringe the rights of third parties. In all cases, cite the Yale Peabody Museum as the source and, if particular content is copyrighted, you must cite all copyright information and comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that content. Open Access of Public Domain Materials The Yale Peabody Museum is working to implement Yale University’s policy on open access on digital representations of works in the public domain from Yale’s museum, library and archive collections to make Yale Peabody Museum public domain materials freely accessible. Not all available content is unrestricted. Please refer to the rights information in the record for each item. Credit and Attribution If you use or reproduce Yale Peabody Museum materials in any format, we ask that you provide attribution to the Yale Peabody Museum and cite the author and source of the materials as you would material from any printed work. Please see the credit line provided in the record for each item. Use the acronym “YPM” and the letter prefix with its 6-digit catalog number to cite Yale Peabody Museum specimens and artifacts, and include the URL “http://peabody.yale.edu” in addition to any copyright and/or proprietary notices accompanying the materials. For example: The type specimen for Torosaurus latus Marsh, 1891 (YPM VP 001830).

While copyright laws protect the copyright owner’s property rights in the work, privacy and publicity rights protect the interests of the individuals who are the subject of the work. The right of publicity is a person’s right to control, and profit from, the use of his or her name, image and likeness. This means that any use of a person’s name, image or likeness for commercial gain is not permitted without his or her consent. The right of privacy is a person’s right to live outside of the public eye and free from the publicizing of intimate details of his or her life, which means that directing unwanted public attention to a person may give rise to a cause of action. While a person’s right to privacy generally ends with his or her death, publicity rights associated with the commercial value of that person’s name, image or likeness may continue after death. For example, many estates and representatives of famous deceased authors, photographers, celebrities and other well-known individuals continue to control and license use of their names and likenesses. Issues pertaining to privacy and publicity may arise when you contemplate the use of the materials in the Yale Peabody Museum’s collections. For instance, if you want to download and reproduce a copyrighted photograph containing the name or likeness of one or more individuals, in addition to determining whether your intended use requires consent from the copyright holder and, if so, securing the copyright holder’s written permission, you may also need to secure the consent of the people in the photograph to comply with state privacy and publicity laws. You are solely responsible for addressing issues of privacy and publicity rights relating to your use of these materials. The Yale Peabody Museum cannot advise you on whether materials you wish to use require third-party permissions. Privacy Statement The Yale Peabody Museum is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to its web services.
