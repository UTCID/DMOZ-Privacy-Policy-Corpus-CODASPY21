The admissions process at Thomas Aquinas College is entirely need-blind, and institutional financial aid eligibility is determined solely on the basis of financial need, not academic merit.
The College will not disclose to third parties any individual identifying information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, financial information, or any other personal information which users voluntarily provide, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or legal processes (e.g. subpoenas), or to protect the rights or property of the College.
Questions regarding the Net Price Calculator, can be directed to the Financial Aid Office at Thomas Aquinas College. Feel free to contact us by e-mail.
