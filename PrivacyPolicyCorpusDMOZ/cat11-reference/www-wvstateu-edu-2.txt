CONFIDENTIAL VS NON-CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCES AT WVSU
Confidential Resources – There are numerous services at WVSU which CAN NOT report your communications or treatment to other parties… such as the Counseling and Accessibility (CAS) office.  The only time these offices can share information about you is (1) when you waiver the confidentiality, (2) someone’s safety is at issue or (3) when required to do so by a valid court order.  These are referred to as confidential resources.
Contact Information: (304) 766-3262; 125 Sullivan Hall, East
Contact Information: (304) 766-3224; 129 Sullivan Hall, East
Contact Information: REACH Advocate, The Counseling Connection
1021 Quarrier Street, Suite 414

304-340-3676; www.tccwv.org
24-Hour Number: 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)
Non-Confidential Resources – There are resources and individuals at WVSU that are also helpful but who have the duty to report to the university when they become aware that students have been the victim of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.  Even though these individuals and resources have a duty to report it does not mean that they are still not mindful of your privacy.  In these situations, privacy means that the information related to a report of these types of incidents will only be shared with the limited amount of university employees that are needed to support the complainant.  These are called Non-Confidential resources.  Examples of non-confidential resources or individuals at include the WVSU Public Safety, Professors, WVSU Staff, Resident Assistants, Housing Staff and Title IX Personnel.
Professors, WVSU Staff, Resident Assistants and Housing Staff
After suffering an incident of sexual assault, relationship violence or stalking, some students choose to go straight to their professors to ask for more time to complete assignments.  Some student may ask their Resident Assistant or another member of WVSU staff for help.  This approach to seeking help is a valid and often used process.  WVSU wants all students to be aware that all WVSU employees that do not fall under the category of being “confidential employees” are “responsible employees” with the duty to report when they have knowledge that a student may have been the victim of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.
Title IX Personnel
While handling a report on a Title IX issue, Title IX personnel will make all efforts to protect both the complainant and respondent’s privacy and follow the wishes of both parties as to whether an investigation will go forward or what types of remedial measures will be offered.  However, if asked to proceed with a Title IX investigation or to assist in obtaining remedial measures for a complainant, Title IX personnel must have some contact with other individuals regarding the matter.
