Finally, control what everyone sees and says about you online - all in one place
No one makes it easier to protect your privacy and build your reputation.
I was really shocked at how much of my info was on the internet-address, phone numbers-everything! MyLife helped me stop those sites from exposing my info.

How It Works
1
We scan the internet for you:
You'll see all the private information about you that's exposed and sold across the web, and all the places it's available. We even give you the ability to delete with a single click anything you don't want exposed.
2
We help craft your public image:
Select what information you want to make public or keep private. Decide where you'll allow your information to appear. Customize your profile and craft the image that suits you best personally and professionally to choose how you want to appear to the world.
3
We continually monitor your identity 24/7:
Get alerts when we find new information about you on the web. We'll even constantly scan the illegal web to make sure you or anyone in your family have not lost valuable private information in a data breach. You'll also be alerted when someone searches for you and looks at you information: opportunities of interest, or threats to your privacy, reputation and identity. And we back our identity theft protection with a $1 million guarantee!
SEE WHAT'S EXPOSED
What types of data are scattered?
Every day you create an immense amount of data that's scattered and sold online.

Why It Matters
Not everything online about you is created by you. Your social media profiles contains the information you control. But what matters most is your private information — including home address, phone number and family member's names — available to anyone on public websites that you know nothing about.
This data affects your life. It tells friends, colleagues, even strangers, stalkers and thieves where and how you live your life.
You need to control where your private information is exposed and who's accessing it to effectively protect and monitor your reputation, privacy, and identity.
We'll show you everything the Internet reveals about you — and help remove unwanted info with a single click. And our 24/7 monitoring alerts you when new information is exposed, including data breach threats. Because the information exposed about you online affects your life offline.
