Throughout our webpages, we provide links to other servers which may contain information of interest to our readers. We take no responsibility for, and exercise no control over, the organizations, privacy policies, views, or accuracy of the information contained on other servers.
Statistics and Data-Tracking
The Newberry may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track browsing activity on the Newberry website and the online services we work with in order to assess the navigational structure of our website and, when necessary, make changes that will enhance the user experience.

Credit Card Security
We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use a high-grade encryption key (RC4, 128 bit) and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software.
