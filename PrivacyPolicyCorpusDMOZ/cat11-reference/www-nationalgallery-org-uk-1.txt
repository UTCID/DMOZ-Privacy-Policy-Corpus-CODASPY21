How do we use your information and what is our legal basis for processing it?
We will only process your information if we have a legal basis for doing so under current UK data protection legislation, including:

Where we combine information we hold about you to better understand your interests and preferences so that we can target communications we send to you in line with the information contained in this privacy policy;

Where particular areas of the Gallery are going to be used for filming or photography, we will always flag this in advance with clear signage or otherwise make you aware of the filming in advance, so that you can avoid being filmed or photographed.
Where we are relying on this basis of processing you have the right to object to this. See below ‘What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?'
As a public authority we may also process your personal data where it is necessary for performing our Public Task.
We may process special category data (for example, health data) on the basis of additional grounds, including where it is necessary to protect an individual's vital interests (for example where you have a life-threatening accident or illness while visiting the Gallery and we have to process your personal data in order to make sure you receive appropriate medical attention).

Unauthorised access;
improper use or disclosure;
unauthorised modification; and
