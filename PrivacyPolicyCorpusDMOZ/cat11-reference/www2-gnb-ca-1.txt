Information Collected: Non-Personal
The moment you visit our website, some non-personal information is collected by the Government of New Brunswick and its various departments and agencies.
We collect information automatically about your visit to our website. The information collected includes basic demographic data and browsing patterns. It is used only in aggregate form. We use aggregate information (so that no individual user is identified):
to build up audience profiles;
to aid strategic development, and
to analyze use of the website.
We also collect personal information through enquiry forms and every time you e-mail us your details.
Information Collected: Personal
All personal information acquired by the Government of New Brunswick in any format, including electronic, is governed and maintained according to policies and procedures in accordance with the Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. We only collect personal information through application forms, enquiry forms and e-mails. This personal information must be divulged by you - it is not 'gleaned' from your computer.
