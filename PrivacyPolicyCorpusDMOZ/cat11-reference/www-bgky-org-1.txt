Web Accessibility Compliance Plan
The BGKY.org website is an increasingly important resource for citizens interacting with local government. Many times it serves as the first point of contact with our organization. It is critical that our website be accessible to everyone, including those with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, or other disabilities.
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 requires all federal entities to provide equal access to electronic services, programs, and content. While not a federal agency, we seek to meet this standard to contribute to the inclusiveness of our community, while also decreasing our exposure to sanctions, fines, and lawsuits.
As is the case with many organizations, our website was developed over time, by many different departments, and with varying amounts of attention paid to the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. For this reason, bringing our site into compliance will not be a quick or easy task. However, a plan has been established and is currently underway. An outline of this plan can be viewed below:
Establish Scope and Target
Identify and select a standard to follow.
Define which sections need to be brought under compliance.
Assess the Current Situation
Select and implement tool that will audit and continually monitor areas for accessibility issues.
Run initial evaluation on sites that need to be brought under compliance.
Prioritize Solutions
Prioritize high impact, easily addressed barriers.
Frequently reused areas such as CSS and base templates (headers, footers, etc.) are a good place to begin making widespread improvements in a short amount of time.
Prioritize important functionality, high use content, and key entry points to the sites.
Implement Repairs
Estimate time and costs associated with the needed changes. We need to be sure that the time and cost associated with the change is acceptable given our available resources.
Assign repair work to either developer or content editors (based on each issue).
Review and Evaluate Achievements
Once repairs are complete, run tests with auditing software to ensure the issue has been resolved.
Document any outstanding issues that can be addressed in the future, or as part of ongoing maintenance.
The City of Bowling Green is now updating its website to meet W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0), Level A criterion. You may view a copy of our proposed standards by using the following link:
