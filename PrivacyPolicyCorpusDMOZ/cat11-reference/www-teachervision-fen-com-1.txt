VI. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS OF USE
This Terms of Use may be revised from time to time through an updated posting, and therefore you should check this Terms of Use periodically. Revisions are effective upon posting and your continued use of the Site or the TV Membership Service following the posting of a revision will indicate your acceptance of such revision. However, any changes to the Arbitration and Controlling Law sections will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or before the date the change is posted.
VII. MODIFICATIONS TO OR DISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICE
FEN reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, the TV Membership Service, or any parts thereof. In the case of any scheduled temporary or permanent discontinuance of the TV Membership Service, FEN will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice to Members. If FEN permanently discontinues the TV Membership Service prior to the end of a Member’s then-current subscription term, provided such Member actually paid the subscription fees, FEN will refund the amount paid that exceeds such Member’s prorated subscription fee (calculated by dividing the days of active subscription from the date of registration/node/37131al to the date of permanent discontinuance of the TV Membership Service by FEN, by the total number of days the subscription would have been effective had it not been for the discontinuance (i.e., 365 if it's a one year subscription), and multiplying the result with the amount of the subscription fee actually paid by the Member). No refunds, partial or otherwise, will be provided for any temporary discontinuance of the Site, including the TV Membership Services or any portions thereof, including, without limitation, for emergency or routine maintenance or due to reasons beyond FEN’s reasonable control.
FEN reserves the right to change the price of the subscription to the TV Membership, provided that such price change will not apply to the then-current term of any subscription then existing.

EACH USER AND MEMBER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THEIR PASSWORD(S) AND OTHER ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS, IF ANY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER FEN, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS, WARRANT THAT THE TV SITE OR TV MEMBERSHIP SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE TV SITE OR TV MEMBERSHIP SERVICE, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE TV SITE OR TV MEMBERSHIP SERVICE. IT IS EACH MEMBER’S AND USER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF ALL INFORMATION, OPINIONS AND OTHER MATERIAL ON THE TV SITE OR TV MEMBERSHIP SERVICE OR ANY SITES WITH WHICH THEY ARE LINKED. FEN PROVIDES TECHNOLOGY AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCING SEARCH RESULTS THAT LINK AND/OR REFERENCE SITES AND INFORMATION LOCATED WORLDWIDE THROUGHOUT THE INTERNET. BECAUSE FEN HAS NO CONTROL OVER SUCH SITES AND INFORMATION, FEN MAKES NO GUARANTEE AS TO SUCH SITES AND INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE ACCURACY, CURRENCY, CONTENT OR QUALITY OF ANY SUCH SITES AND INFORMATION AND FEN ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY AS TO WHETHER THE SEARCH LOCATES UNINTENDED OR OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE SOME CONTENT ON THE INTERNET CONSISTS OF MATERIAL THAT IS ADULT-ORIENTED OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE TO SOME PEOPLE, THE RESULTS OF SEARCHES ON FEN SITES MAY AUTOMATICALLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY GENERATE LINKS OR REFERENCES TO OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL. WE MAKE NO CLAIM THAT SUCH SURPRISES MIGHT NOT OCCUR.
THE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, IMPLIED, EXPRESSED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS, IS GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, THE CONTENTS THEREOF, OR ANY HYPERLINKS TO OTHER INTERNET RESOURCES.

Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the clearly established legal right of a consumer to recover attorneys’ fees or other remedies afforded by statute or other law.
Indemnification: To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the FEN Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, costs, liabilities, losses and damages of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from your breach of any provision of these Terms of Use, your violation of the rights of a third party and/or any negligent acts, omissions or intentional wrongdoing by you. Any such indemnification shall be conditioned on the indemnified party: (a) notifying you in writing of any such claim, demand, action, cost, liability, loss or threat thereof; (b) cooperating with you in the defense or settlement thereof; and (c) allowing you to control such defense or settlement. The indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in such defense at its own cost and expense. You will not be required to indemnify and hold the FEN Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses resulting from the FEN Parties’ own negligent conduct.
XI. ARBITRATION
THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO WHICH YOU ARE CONSENTING CONSIST OF A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND A CLASS-ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, by using the Site, you agree that if a dispute arises between you and the FEN Parties relating in any way to the Site and/or your use of the Site, including common law or statutory claims, BOTH YOU AND THE FEN PARTIES SHALL SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. ANY ARBITRATION COMMENCED BETWEEN YOU AND THE FEN PARTIES MUST BE ARBITRATED IN MASSACHUSETTS. ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS NEITHER YOU NOR THE FEN PARTIES MAY JOIN CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION WITH OR AGAINST OTHER USERS, OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION YOU ARE WAIVING CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE DISPUTE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND THE RIGHT TO BRING, OR BE PART OF, A CLASS ACTION CASE. The foregoing shall not apply to suits to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, and you or the FEN Parties may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
IF ANY COURT OR ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER SET FORTH ABOVE IS VOID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON OR THAT AN ARBITRATION CAN PROCEED ON A CLASS BASIS, THEN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL BE DEEMED NULL AND VOID IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THE PARTIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE NOT AGREED TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.
