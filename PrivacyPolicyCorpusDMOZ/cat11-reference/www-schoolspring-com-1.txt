Liability Disclaimers
SchoolSpring.com is only a venue. This site acts as a venue for Clients to post job opportunities and Candidates to post profiles and relevant information and does not screen or censor the listings offered. PowerSchool is not involved in the actual transaction between Clients and Candidates. As a result, PowerSchool has no control over the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or information posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings. In addition, note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through the SchoolSpring.com site.
Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, PowerSchool cannot and does not confirm that each user is who they claim to be. Because PowerSchool does not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of participants on the site, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release PowerSchool (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential, direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code d1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
PowerSchool is under no legal obligation to, and generally does not, control the information provided by other users which is made available through the SchoolSpring.com site. By its very nature, other people's information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
PowerSchool expects that you will use caution and common sense when using this site.
