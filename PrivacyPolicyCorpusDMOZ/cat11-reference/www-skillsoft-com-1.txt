Privacy, Cybersecurity, and Data Protection
What you will learn
Protecting privacy and ensuring the security of data are more than only following government regulations. Organizations must develop sound data security policies to assist in preventing the unauthorized or unintentional disclosure of data. Data security breaches involving the financial information of customers are well publicized and, unfortunately, all too common. A robust privacy and data protection program – including an emphasis on cybersecurity and end-user best practices – can help avoid the costly consequences of data loss while protecting the company’s reputation.
For global organizations, privacy and data protection requirements continue to increase and become more complex with new laws including GDPR and CCPA . Employees must know the obligations of the company to protect customer and employee personal data. One must understand the risk of breaching those obligations, and the security measures needed to protect such information.

The course also provides employees with common sense guidelines dealing with areas such as mobile security, online security, password security, and malicious e-mails.
