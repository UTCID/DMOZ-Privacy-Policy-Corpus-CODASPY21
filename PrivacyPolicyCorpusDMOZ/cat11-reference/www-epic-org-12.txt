Freedom of Information Documents on the USA PATRIOT Act
EPIC has used the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to seek information
about the government's use of USA PATRIOT Act authority since shortly after
the law was passed by Congress in October 2001. EPIC has obtained USA PATRIOT
Act-related documents through independent FOIA efforts, and also joined the
ACLU to litigate two cases concerning the government's implementation of
the controversial law.
EPIC v. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 05-845 (D.D.C. GK) In a complaint
(pdf) filed in April 2005, EPIC asked a federal court to force the FBI to
disclose information about its use of expanded investigative authority granted
by sunsetting provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The agency agreed
(pdf) to quickly process EPIC's Freedom of Information Act request
(pdf) for the data, but did not comply with the timeline for even a standard
FOIA request. The lawsuit, now pending, was filed amid numerous congressional
hearings reviewing controversial sections of the USA PATRIOT Act. Many of
these provisions are slated to expire at the end of 2005 unless the administration
makes the case for renewal.
The FBI released a small number of documents in October 2005, after Congress
had concluded its hearings and already drafted legislation to renew the sunsetting
provisions. These documents included reports of intelligence misconduct from
the FBI to an intelligence oversight board.
In November 2005, Judge Gladys Kessler ordered
(pdf) the FBI to publicly release or account for 1,500 of pages responsive
to the request every fifteen days.

ACLU and EPIC v. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 03-2522 (D.D.C.
ESH) On October 23, 2003, EPIC, the ACLU and allied library and booksellers' organizations
submitted a FOIA request to the FBI seeking information about Section 215
of the USA PATRIOT Act. When FBI denied expedited processing, EPIC and the
ACLU filed suit in federal court seeking the immediate release of the requested
records.
On May 10, 2004, U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle ordered the FBI to expeditiously
process the request. Some responsive records were released in June 2004, and
more documents were released in July.

ACLU and EPIC v. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 02-2077 (D.D.C.
ESH) EPIC, joined by the American Civil Liberties Union and library and booksellers'
organizations, filed suit on October 24, 2002 under the FOIA seeking the disclosure
of information concerning implementation of the controversial USA PATRIOT
Act. The lawsuit covers some of the information the Justice Department withheld
from the House Judiciary Committee in response to a set of detailed questions.
On November 26, 2002, U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle ordered
(PDF) the Justice Department to complete its processing of the EPIC/ACLU information
request by January 15, 2003. DOJ and the FBI released some responsive material,
but withheld a substantial amount of information asserting national security
classification.
