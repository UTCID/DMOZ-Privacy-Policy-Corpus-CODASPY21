5. What is our legal basis for processing your data?
As part of our work, we process and store personal information relating to students, faculty, staff, alumni, current and potential supporters, partners, and friends of CEU and we therefore adhere to the applicable data protection rules. We take our responsibilities under these rules seriously and ensure the personal information we obtain is held, used, transferred and processed in accordance with the applicable data privacy rules. CEU processes the information outlined in this Privacy Notice in pursuit of our legitimate interests in:
Communicating with students, faculty, staff, alumni, employers, partners, and current and potential supporters;

Although CEU relies on legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing where this is not overridden by the interests and rights or freedoms of the data subjects concerned, it recognizes that it is not the only lawful ground for processing data. As such, where appropriate, CEU will sometimes process your data on an alternative legal basis – for example, based on a legal obligation (when reporting may be required to the Hungarian or American tax authorities, for instance) or when you give your explicit consent to us to do so.

If we become aware that your personal data has changed we will update our records to reflect this. In subsequent instances where we provide for example your name (e.g. a class list) we will use your current name alongside any previous names (such as your maiden name) to ensure you can be identified correctly. The University also maintains records of current and potential donors, partners, employers, and event attendees.

Name, title, gender, and date of birth;
Contact details including postal address, email address, phone number and links to social media accounts;

7. Who receives your information?
CEU offices work closely together to provide a coordinated approach. Any transmission of data between CEU units is managed through agreed processes which comply with relevant data protection legislation. Some individual units elaborate their own data protection procedures in Privacy Notices similar to this one, which may be found on the respective unit’s CEU web page.
Unless we have a legal obligation to do so, we will not disclose your data to individuals, organizations, or other entities outside the University other than those who are acting as agents and data processors working on our behalf.
For the purposes set out in section 4, we may need to pass your information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors, CEU’s related organizations, or volunteers for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to process donations, send you mailings, print our annual report, or volunteer on an advisory committee). However, with all external entities with whom data is shared, we share only those data needed to perform the specific service and require a contract and/or confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement to be signed before any data transfer—requiring them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own purposes. We will not sell or rent your information to third parties.
When you are using our secure online donation or event registration pages, your donation or payment is processed by a third-party payment processor specializing in the secure processing of credit/debit card transactions. We do not retain credit card information for future use unless you authorize monthly or other periodic transactions.
Specific third parties we work with include:
Office 365: Based in the US, with CEU’s data stored within EU in datacenters located in Amsterdam and Dublin. Software As A Service which provides CEU’s email and document management.
Raiser’s Edge and related Blackbaud providers (Online Express, Blackbaud Merchant Services): Based in the US and UK, this group of providers serves as a contact management platform, inclusive of secure donation processing capacity, and the Citrix email exchange.
Mailchimp and Constant Contact: Based in the US, Mailchimp and Constant Contact enable CEU to share news about the University, and provide us with data on opens and clicks from our newsletters.
Eventbrite: Based in the US, Eventbrite provides us with an event technology platform which enables our faculty, staff, students, alumni, employers, and supporters to book events with us.
iWave: Aggregator of publicly available data for contacts in the US and Canada to support research for appropriately-tailored funding proposals.
Regulators and other authorities acting as processors based in the US and Hungary who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances, such as the US Internal Revenue Service.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
8. How long will your information be held?
We consider being a member of the CEU community as a lifelong relationship. Generally, CEU will look to retain personal data of our stakeholders until the individual asks us to remove it from our records. We will routinely remind you of your right to have us remove your personal data.
Further, as a fundraising institution founded and powered by visionary philanthropy, CEU relies on ongoing relationships with its alumni, supporters, and their families to enable the University to carry out its educational mission. Especially in cases of donations of bequests and endowments—which are vital to our teaching, research, and community engagement—the generosity that sustains CEU may endure well beyond a supporter’s lifetime. Therefore, unless otherwise requested, or unless deemed inactive under periodic review, CEU will hold supporter records in perpetuity. As noted above, CEU maintains records of all former students of the University and, as such, we hold education records in perpetuity.
If you decide that you no longer wish to receive communication from CEU, please be aware that we still need to retain a minimal amount of personal data so that we can keep a record that you have asked us not to contact you.
9. What are your rights?
You have a right
to access your personal information,
to object to the processing of your personal information,
to rectify,
to erase and
to restrict processing your personal information.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email privacy@ceu.edu or write to us at CEU Data Protection Officer, Nádor utca 9, 1051 Budapest, Hungary.

10. Security of your information
We are committed to holding your data securely and treating it with sensitivity. All data are held securely and in accordance with the relevant data privacy laws and our internal policies. We do not sell to or trade your data with any other organizations. For further details please see CEU’s Data Protection Policy.
Although most of the information we store and process stays within Hungary, some information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may occur if, for example, one of our trusted partners’ servers are located in a country outside the EEA. Where these countries do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union, we will take steps to make sure they provide an adequate level of protection in accordance with EU data protection law.
11. Future changes
If our information policies or practices change at some time in the future, we will post the changes on our website among our Official Documents (https://documents.ceu.edu/).
