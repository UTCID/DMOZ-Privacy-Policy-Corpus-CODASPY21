Student Activities
Student Activities mentors students in the design and implementation of a variety
of campus programs, developing them as leaders and building their collaborative, organizational,
and administrative skills through which they build a vibrant and engaging campus community.
Our goal is to orient students to Seaver College; provide opportunities for experiential
learning in leadership, social skills, and teamwork, and for the development of long-term
friendships; and to create a lively and enriching campus environment consistent with
our Christian mission.
