Lebanon Valley College Privacy Policy
This document was last updated May 14, 2012
Welcome! Lebanon Valley College (referred to herein as "LVC," "we," "us," or "our") recognizes the importance and is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our site users. Among our goals is the intention to give the end user as much control as possible over personal information. Collecting information is an inherent part of the normal operation of our sites (and of practically all Internet sites). This privacy policy describes what information is collected, how it is collected, why it is collected, and how it may be used ("Privacy Policy"). Please read our complete Privacy Policy. After reading it, users can make informed decisions about whether and how to make use of our various Internet services. LVC will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is part of, and governed by, the Lebanon Valley College Terms of Use (which is available at this link) and this Privacy Policy is incorporated therein. If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, please do not use this website.
Web Server Log Files
Like practically all web servers, our Internet hosts collect and store information sent by the web browser when it makes a request for web content. Collected information may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address being used by a user's computer, or by the firewall or proxy server of the user's network; the hostname associated with that address; the date and time the browser made the request; what page or file was requested; the page the browser "came from" immediately before the request; and "user agent" information, which normally includes the browser software and operating system the computer is currently running. These logs are tied to personally identifiable information and are stored for the purpose of analyzing trends in how people are using our systems. With this information, we identify heavy use periods, the most common web browsers, the most popular content on our sites, and other related information that helps us improve the usefulness and performance of our websites.
Electronic Mail and Messaging Software
When a user contacts a representative of LVC using electronic mail ("email") or an Instant Messaging service, information included in that message may be used to respond to the message or to provide a requested service or information. The message, or information in it, may be shared with other employees of the College for the purpose of providing requested information or a requested service. Information collected in this way, including email addresses and messaging usernames, is never distributed to persons or organizations outside LVC unless absolutely necessary to fulfill a request. LVC does not give or sell lists of email addresses for commercial purposes.
Emergency Alerts
Lebanon Valley College's emergency alerts are delivered using e2Campus, a mass notification system from Omnilert. This system allows students, faculty, and staff to receive text messages on cell phones, email accounts, and other "smart" communications devices. You must register for this service to receive emergency alerts. After you have registered, you may add to your profile two cell phone numbers and two email addresses at which to receive emergency alerts. Register for LVC Emergency Alerts by using the form at the bottom of this page. Parents: If you would like to receive the College's emergency alerts, ask your student to add your cell phone number or email address to their profile.

Support/Help—For support or information about Lebanon Valley College Alerts & Info, text HELP at any time to 67942. You can also email us at admission@lvc.edu or call 1-866-582-4236.
Privacy Policy—Lebanon Valley College respects the privacy of our users. LVC will never, under any circumstances, sell or distribute your cell phone number to parties who are not affiliated with the College.
Compatible Carriers—Compatible carries include but are not limited to: AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, Metro PCS.
Carrier Disclaimer—T-Mobile is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Some of our resources are made available using FTP. Many browsers are configured to provide the user's e-mail address as the "password" for anonymous FTP requests. In those cases, the e-mail address so provided may be recorded in the FTP server's request log. LVC does not make any use of addresses stored in this way except to analyze FTP server usage.
Web Server Cookies
Some of our sites create a "cookie," i.e., a record on your computer's own hard disk, which makes it possible for our sites to recognize that a specific computer has made previous requests. Our cookies are used exclusively for providing services requiring such a record. LVC does not track cookies for any purpose other than the needs of such web-based applications. If you disable cookies you may not be able to use portions of the LVC website.
Surveys
LVC may occasionally conduct online surveys of its user base, which may include both campus community members and users who are not directly affiliated with LVC. As part of such surveys we may, with the user's permission, collect personal and potentially identifying information. Any information gathered in this way is used for quantitative analysis of services, perceived qualities of the college, and users' attitudes towards LVC or its Internet sites. If such information is to be made available to other organizations or to be published, that fact will be made known to users prior to participation, and their permission will be explicitly requested. Users can decline to participate if there is concern about the use of the collected information. Survey information will be released only in aggregate form, and not in connection with any identified individual user.
Customer Data Protection
LVC may collect information from a user, with the user's permission, for the purpose of providing various services and information, possibly including promotional materials, or periodic updates on offered services or the progress of a previous request. Information collected in this way may be shared with other persons or departments within the college, but will not be shared in any way with persons or organizations that are not part of LVC, unless necessary to fulfill a user's request (for example, providing credit card information to a payment processor to complete a payment transaction).
LVC will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on LVC on the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of LVC; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the LVC website or the public.
Children's Privacy (under the age of 14)
LVC takes children's privacy seriously. We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our website. If we become aware that a person submitting information to us through any part of our website is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and deleted the information, we will of course honor that request.
Outside Links
Much of LVC's web content includes links to content on Internet servers belonging to other persons or organizations, and not to LVC. LVC cannot control or make any representation concerning those persons' or organizations' collection and use of personal information. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. Any information you provide to one of these other websites will be governed by the privacy policy of that website, and not by this Privacy Policy.
Circumstances Beyond Our Control
This Privacy Policy explains how information collected from users is used by LVC. However, it is not a guarantee of privacy. It is possible for collected information to be disclosed without LVC's permission or knowledge (for example, if an Internet host is "attacked", or is compromised by a virus). For this reason LVC disclaims any warranty or representation of privacy or non-disclosure of information collected through the use of our Internet sites.
Contact LVC
LVC strives to protect customer privacy. Should you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at webmaster@lvc.edu.
