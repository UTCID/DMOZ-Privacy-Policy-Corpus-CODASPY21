A cookie is a piece of text placed on your computer by a web server. We occasionally use ''session'' cookies on some parts of cuny.edu to enhance your experience of the site and to help you move through it easily. Session cookies created on your computer by CUNY servers do not contain personal information. We may use a session cookie to store a randomly generated identifying tag on your computer. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted during operation of your browser or when your browser is closed. Most web browsers may be customized to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Rejecting or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this web site and could result in the loss of any customized setting.

We maintain log files of all access to cuny.edu and also monitor network traffic for purposes of site management and security. We use this information to help diagnose problems with the server and to carry out other administrative tasks. We also use log analysis tools for such purposes as creating summary statistics to determine which information is of most interest to users, identifying system problem areas, and determining technical requirements. The following information is typically collected in these files:
The Internet Protocol address and domain name of your Internet Service Provider and/or computer, if your computer has an IP address assigned directly to it;
The type of browser and operating system you use;
The date and time you visited Baruch.cuny.edu;
The web pages or services you accessed at cuny.edu and amount of time spent at each page; and
