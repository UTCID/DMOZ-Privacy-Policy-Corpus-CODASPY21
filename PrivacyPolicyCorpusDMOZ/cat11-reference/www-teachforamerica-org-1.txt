TEACH FOR AMERICA PRIVACY POLICY
At Teach For America, we value your support and respect your privacy rights. To demonstrate our commitment to protecting your rights, we created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"), which explains how we treat the information collected and received from your use of our website www.teachforamerica.org, internal summit websites, and Teach For America store www.teachforamericastore.com, (collectively, the "Website"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website, and we are not responsible for the practices of persons, companies, or websites that Teach For America does not control, manage, or employ. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use Agreement ("Terms of Use") and other published guidelines, we do not release personal information about our users without obtaining their written permission.
What Information this Privacy Policy Covers
Most of our Website's features can be used without revealing any personal information, though, for some specific features or services, personal information, such as your email address will be required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Website, then the only information we collect will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that is not traceable back to you and cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Website, you may need to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be traced back to you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name, home address, telephone number, and email address. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Teach For America. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Website, the information you receive when using the Website, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the main ways in which we communicate with you.
What You Consent to by Using Our Website
By using the website you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, and/or by using our Website, you consent and agree that we may collect, use, and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services that can be offered on our Website.
What Information We Collect
We gather two types of information about users through the Website:
Non-Personal Information. When users come to our Website, we may track, collect, and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Website were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Website. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. At no time do we disclose information pertaining to site usage or individual IP addresses to third parties.
We also use or may use Cookies, which are electronic identifiers that are transferred automatically to your computer through your browser that allow our computers to save certain information you provide us and store information about you so we can recognize you when you visit our Website in the future.
