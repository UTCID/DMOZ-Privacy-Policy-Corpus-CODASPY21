CampusMoodle VLE Site Policy
CampusMoodle VLE Site Policy and Data Protection Statement
Introduction
Campus Moodle is the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) used at The Robert Gordon University. It is based on the Moodle 'Course Management System' (http://www.moodle.org), a free open source software package designed using sound pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective online learning communities. Moodle is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
Campus Moodle provides a range of features for the delivery, support, administration and participation in teaching and learning activities. The features include content delivery and collaboration between tutors and learners, such as:
Content creation or upload;
Discussion forums and chat rooms;
Messaging tools;
Assignments;
Quizzes; and
Monitoring of users' online activity.
The Campus Moodle VLE is integrated with the Robert Gordon University Student Records database to enable the creation of accounts for enrolled students and their allocation to the appropriate study areas. Other software and web services may also be linked to provide an integrated learning environment for staff and students. The Campus Moodle VLE is defined as the Robert Gordon University implementation of the Moodle course management system and all other linked software tools for the support and delivery of teaching, learning and research at Robert Gordon University. Hereafter it will be referred to as 'The Robert Gordon University VLE'.
