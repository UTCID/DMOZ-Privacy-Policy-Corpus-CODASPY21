STUDENT RECORDS/CONFIDENTIALITY
NMCC believes that it is of paramount importance and in the best interest of all its members that confidentiality about personal information is maintained.  NMCC is committed to safeguarding confidential information concerning its students from unauthorized disclosure.  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, provide the following rights for students attending Northern Maine Community College:
The right of a student, with limitations, to inspect and review his or her educational records.
The right, with exceptions, to prevent disclosure to third parties of information from his or her educational records.
The right to withhold public disclosure of any or all items of so-called “Directory Information” by written notification to the Dean of Students within two weeks after publication of this notice.  The term “Directory Information” includes (but is not limited to) a student’s name, confirmation of enrollment, degree earned (if applicable), and major course of study.
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning the alleged failure of NMCC to comply with requirements of the Act.
