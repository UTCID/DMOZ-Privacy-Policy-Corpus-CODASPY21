Commitment to Protection of Individual Privacy
The University of Colorado (“CU” or the “University”) supports the protection of individual privacy and is committed to ensuring the confidentiality of personally identifiable information provided by its employees, students, and other members of the university community.  However, because the University of Colorado is a public institution, some personally identifiable information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act[1]. In addition, the University may disclose information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.
What information does the University collect?
You may access most University of Colorado websites without providing personally identifiable information, however you may need to provide personal information to use certain services. The amount and type of personal information to use these services varies. It is the practice of the University of Colorado to collect the least amount of personally identifiable information necessary to provide services and meet any legal obligations.

How does the University collect this information?
You directly provide most of the personal information that the University collects when you use our services.  However, in some cases, we may collect information from a third-party that has the authority to share your personal information with the University. For example, the University may receive personal data through the Common App college application system.

How does the University share my information?
The University may share personal information within the University. However, the University restricts access to Personal Information to individuals and groups who have a legitimate need to access the data.

How does the University protect my information?
The University has security policies and standards regarding the protection of personal information. These standards include both administrative and technical requirements to ensure information receives appropriate protection. Each campus has an information security officer and team who assist departments in providing appropriate protection for personal information. This includes active monitoring and assessments to detect potential security issues. Additionally, the University has an internal audit team that periodically performs security related audits.
When information is handled by third parties, the University relies on a combination of contractual requirements, security reviews/assessments and third-party audits to ensure information is appropriately protected.  Some third-party websites use UCCS branding but are governed by separate privacy policies.  Users are encouraged to review all third-party privacy practices, including those linked on UCCS or UCCS-related websites.
