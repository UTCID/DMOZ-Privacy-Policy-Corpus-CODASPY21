We reopen on Dec 2 2020
While in lockdown we have been working on helping visitors see a little more of our lovely Museum and the history of Swaffham via this website. We have exciting Video presentations for you:
The first is a story that you can read to your children or grandchildren. On our stairway is a stained glass window featuring the Pedlar of Swaffham. And you may have seen him on the Swaffham town sign. Click on the video below and learn all about him.
And on our Virtual Museum page we have:
Photographs of Swaffham from the ground. The Rotary Capture Swaffham 2019 Competition entries
A Lockdown Quiz of Swaffham Town
A Virtual visit of the Ben Emmerson Gallery
Another Quiz with aerial images of Swaffham and surrounding villages
