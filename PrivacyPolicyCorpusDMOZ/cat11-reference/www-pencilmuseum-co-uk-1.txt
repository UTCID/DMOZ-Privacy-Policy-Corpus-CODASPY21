Derwent Pencil Museum
Home of the world's first pencil!Located in Keswick, the home of the first pencil, visitors enter this museum through a replica graphite mine which would have served as the source of the pencil industry over three centuries ago. A journey of graphite and pencil discovery from its humble beginnings as a cottage industry to modern day production.Discover our secret WW2 pencils with hidden maps; one of the largest colour pencils in the world measuring almost 8 metres; The Queen's diamond Jubilee pencil; miniature pencil sculptures; and much much more! We also have a Derwent fine art retail shop, run art workshops and there is a coffee shop with free Wi-Fi. A great day-out for the family and we look forward to welcoming you.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for updates and the latest news. We are now on Instagram!
