Force Majeure
We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms and Conditions, for any failure or delay in our performance under these Terms and Conditions when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining adequate or suitable supplies, breakdown of materials or telecommunications, or power outage.

Dispute Resolution
Governing Law
These Terms and Conditions and your use of this Site shall be governed by and construed for both substantive and procedural purposes in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any principles of any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Maryland to apply.
Timing of Claims
Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to this Site must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.
Arbitration and Venue
ANY DISPUTE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR VISIT TO THIS SITE SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND, EXCEPT THAT, TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, AND YOU CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN SUCH COURTS. Arbitration under these Terms and Conditions shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and before a single arbitrator.
Ultimately, the selected arbitrator must have expertise in the subject matter of the dispute. The expenses of the arbitration charged by the arbitrator shall be borne by the prevailing party or otherwise as appropriately allocated between the parties to the arbitration by the arbitrator in his or her discretion. However, in every other regard, each party shall pay for and bear its own costs and legal fees, costs, and expenses. The arbitration shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of either giving notice or filing a demand to arbitrate with the American Arbitration Association (whichever shall first occur).
Final Arbitration
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The testimony, evidence, ruling, and all documentation regarding any arbitration shall be considered confidential information. Neither party may use, disclose, or divulge any such information unless otherwise required by law.
Class Action Waiver
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms and Conditions shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms and Conditions, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER USERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one (1) person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Miscellaneous
The division of these Terms and Conditions into sections and the headings of the various sections in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of these Terms and Conditions. You acknowledge and agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to these Terms and Conditions. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these Terms and Conditions. We may assign these Terms and Conditions, including our rights and duties under these Terms and Conditions, to any party at any time without notice to you and without your express consent. You will not assign or otherwise delegate these Terms and Conditions, including any of your rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions, without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms and Conditions. There shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms and Conditions. Any provision of these Terms and Conditions that contemplates performance or observance subsequent to any expiration or termination of these Terms and Conditions, or which is otherwise necessary to interpret the respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall survive any expiration or termination of these Terms and Conditions and continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be held unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms and Conditions, together with our Privacy Policy and all other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
