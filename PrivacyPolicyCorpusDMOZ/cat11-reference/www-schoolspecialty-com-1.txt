MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Wisconsin, without
giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You and School
Specialty each agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the state of Wisconsin and the federal courts of the Eastern
District of Wisconsin. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision
shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the
entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
herein and shall not be modified except by writing, signed by both
parties. School Specialty does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted
or secure access to our services, and operation of this Website may be
interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. If any
provision of these Terms & Conditions of Use is held to be invalid
or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining
provisions shall be enforced. You agree that these Terms &
Conditions of Use and all incorporated agreements may be automatically
assigned by School Specialty, in its sole discretion, to a third party
in the event of a merger or acquisition. Headings are for reference
purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the
scope or extent of such section. The failure of School Specialty to act
with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to
act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. The User and School
Specialty are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint
venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is
intended or created by these Terms & Conditions of Use.
