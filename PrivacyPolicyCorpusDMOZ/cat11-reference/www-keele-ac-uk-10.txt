Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Asset Rating of A and,
Display Energy Certificate (DEC) Operational Rating of C or above in the first year following completion
Refurbishments (>£1m)
SKA HE Gold rating or equivalent or,
BREEM refurbishment rating Excellent
Keele University uses BREEAM as the primary standard to achieve its sustainability aims in new builds and major refurbishments.

Comprising of two key parts; a design stage assessment and post construction assessment, developments must demonstrate standards against the following themes:
energy and carbon emissions
energy management
materials and waste
commissioning and handover
customer awareness
water consumption and management
pollution
