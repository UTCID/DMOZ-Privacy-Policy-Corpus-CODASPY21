The Horniman Museum and Gardens is a charitable company, limited by guarantee.
It is also a Non-Departmental Public Body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). This means that although it receives a large part of its funding in the form of Grant in Aid from DCMS, it operates at “arms length” from central government.
