Privacy Policy:
Because we want to provide you with
the most efficient, enhanced, and secured service, we may request information
about you. This Privacy Policy outlines your privacy rights for using
UniversalClass service and lets you know how we ("UniversalClass") collect, use, store and otherwise share information you have provided
us in order to use our services.
This Privacy Policy in conjunction
with our Terms of service as well as any other agreements or policies provided
by UniversalClass governs your use of our services.
If you do not agree with this
Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or any other agreements or policy that

About this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally
identifiable information that we collect when you are anywhere on our sites,
and when you use any of our services.
This policy does not apply to the practices of
companies, schools, or other organizations that we not own or control, or

or the content of those sites.
Summary of Information We Collect and Track
General Usage Information. UniversalClass collects information about all users
collectively, such as what areas users visit and what services members
use. This data is automatically retrieved. This type of general
information is not used to identify specific users, but in an aggregate
form to help us analyze traffic patterns and enhance our service to better
serve our users and advertisers.
UniversalClass Member Registration. When you register on any site or service provided by
UniversalClass, we ask for personal information from you such as a
username, first name, last name, email address, password, country and
other related information. This information is required in order to
provide a course to you as well as secure and store your course progress
and potential course completion. When you log in to our services with your
username and password (that identifies your registration data), you are
not anonymous to us. Both General Usage Information and any personal
details you provide to us is used to enhance and customize content,

last name, and your email address is made available to our staff,
instructors, proctors and other course facilitators in order to both help
and assess your course progress. This information is used to better
enhance your online education experience and to promote free and open
inquiry as well as to hold class participants personally responsible for
their work and behavior within the online class. You do have the option of
sharing your course work and other identifiable information about yourself
to fellow course participants. Should you choose to do this, we are not
responsible of how fellow class participants decide to use this
information about you.
