Policy Review and Approval Process (as of August 2020)
Each university-level policy is subject to review by the Responsible Party on or before
the review date noted on the policy.
If the Responsible Party deems that changes need to be made, he/she may develop an
ad-hoc committee to work on substantive changes or make smaller updates and changes
individually.
The Responsible Party may presents the changes for feedback during the Leadership
Check-in Meetings.
The Responsible Party may choose to incorporate any feedback or to go back to the
ad hoc committee to make further revisions.
The Responsible Party presents the policy changes to the University Advisory Council
(UAC) for discussion. As the shared governance body, UAC will then vote on whether
to approve the policy.
Yea vote – the changes are officially approved.
Nea vote – the policy goes back to the ad hoc committee for further revision.
Upon approval from UAC, policies will be uploaded on the msun.edu website and adopted
as formal policy as of the date approved (unless otherwise noted).
The Chancellor's office communicates substantive policy changes to the campus.
