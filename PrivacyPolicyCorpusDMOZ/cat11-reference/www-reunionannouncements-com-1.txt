Privacy Statement for Reunion Announcements
Reunion announcements has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Reunion Announcements.
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is
used to help identify you.
Our site reunion registration forms require users who submit reunion information to provide committee or organizer contact information (such as name, email address and phone number). The submitter's e-mail contact information will not be displayed on our site unless it is listed as one of the reunion contact fields. The submitter's email may be used by Reunion Announcements to contact the submitter when necessary to resolve issues associated with their entry. The submitter's or contact email ID(s) will never be given out to 3rd parties nor will Reunion Announcements ever provide bulk mailing lists to 3rd parties. Reunion Announcements will also never ask information submitter for their password and any such requests should be considered fraudulent. We will never contact you or your committee members via telephone.
We are not responsible for incorrect
links, information, phone numbers, addresses of any kind. It is the information originator's responsibility to maintain the accuracy of
their listing. We reserve the right to refuse, alter, edit or change any listing submitted. We reserve the right to delete
any listing on our site at any time without prior notification.
This site may contain links to other sites. Reunion Announcements is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.
We do not provide any information to any other website, company or person. The only information about our members and/or listees that is viewable to public is that information which the submitter includes as their reunion contact persons. This information is publicly viewable and accessible by any party that visits this site.
Reunion Announcements strongly advocates use of alternate e-mail IDs (ie. forresthigh1978@freemailprovider.com) for publicly viewable contact information to avoid unwanted junk mail to personal e-mail accounts.
Reunion Announcements reserves the right to revise this policy at any time without advance notification.
