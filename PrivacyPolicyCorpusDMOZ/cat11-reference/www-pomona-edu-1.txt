Privacy Statement
Protecting Your Privacy
Pomona College respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. Therefore, we treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. During your visit to our the College’s main website (www.pomona.edu) or its other public, non-login websites, we may collect and store some technical information, such as the domain name of your Internet provider, which pages you visit, and the time and duration of your stay. This information is used solely to provide us with a better understanding of how our website is being used and to help us make it more useful to visitors like you. It is never used to identify you.
Personal Information
Your personal data will not be forwarded to third parties or used for advertising purposes without your consent, except as required by law or in those cases in which we have engaged an outside organization/service provider to provide services on behalf of the College. In the latter case, the outside organizations/service providers have been carefully selected and have been instructed that they are required to keep such information confidential and prohibited from using it for any other purpose and are regularly controlled.
The College takes every reasonable precaution to keep such information secure. We take extensive technical and operational safety precautions which are regularly reviewed and updated based on technological advancements to avoid loss or misuse of personal data stored by us. However, due to the structure of the Internet, it is possible that data protection regulations and safeguards are not observed by other individuals or institutions that do not fall within our area of responsibility. In particular, unencrypted personal data (for example in an email) can be read by third parties. It is therefore the respective user’s responsibility to protect provided personal data through encryption or other means against abuse.
Public, Non-Login Websites
Our public, non-login websites can usually be used without disclosure of personal data. Personal, identifying information about you is collected and stored only when you provide it voluntarily—for example, when you fill out and submit a web form or send us an email expressly containing such information. This information is used only to provide you with more targeted information about the College or its programs, and is deleted as soon as storing them is no longer necessary and limit processing in case retention obligations apply.
If you visit our website for mere information purposes and you do not register or transfer in any other manner information to us, we only collect the personal data that your browser transfers to our server. When your visit our website, we collect the following personal data that are technically necessary to make our website visible and accessible for you and in order to ensure stability and security of our website (see Article 6 para. 1 cl. 1 lit. f of the GDPR as legal basis):
IP-address
Date and time of your visit
Time difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Access status/HTTP-status code
Amount of transferred data
Website from which the request originated
Browser type/browser version
Operating system and interface

Private, Login Websites
Our private, login websites can usually be used without disclosure of personal data. Personal, identifying information about you is collected and stored only when you provide it voluntarily—by logging onto one of the College’s private web pages, for example, when you interact with course pages. Generally speaking, this information is primarily used to provide you with access to non-public information about courses or activities at the College, and is deleted as soon as storing them is no longer necessary and limit processing in case retention obligations apply.
In addition to the personal data that your browser transfers to our server discussed in the section above, we also collect additional information depending on how you interact with a particular private website. For example, for course pages, this may include the name and academic submissions by a particular student, while for activity pages, this may include a student’s name or other voluntarily submitted information.
For students, staff, and faculty (as well as applicants to each category), the College will keep a record of the details you provided on your application form, any supporting documents requested and additional details provided by any referees and recorded following any interview process. The College will maintain various administrative and financial records about your student and/or employment status, and about your use of the academic and non-academic facilities and services that we offer. Where relevant, we may supplement these records with personal data from the public domain (e.g. your publications) or other sources. Access to your personal information is limited to staff who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their contractual duties, and our use of your personal information will not be excessive.
The College may process some information about you, that you voluntarily provide, that is classified as ‘sensitive’ or ‘special category’ personal data, and which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable accommodations. For certain courses of study/research projects, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions, working with children or vulnerable adults, and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, your ‘sensitive’ personal data are controlled very carefully. You will normally be given further details about our use of any such data when we collect it from you.
In addition, the College will process your personal information for a range of contractual, statutory or public interest purposes, including the following:
To assess your suitability for a particular role or task;
To support you in implementing any health-related accommodations to allow you to carry out a particular role or task;
To fulfill and monitor our responsibilities under immigration, public safety, and other state and federal legislation;
To administer compensation, payroll, benefits and other standard employment functions.
To compile statistics and conduct surveys and research for internal and statutory reporting purposes;
To administer HR-related processes, including those relating to performance/absence management, disciplinary issues and complaints/grievances;
To communicate effectively with you by mail, email and phone, including the distribution of relevant notices;
To support your training, health, safety, welfare and religious requirements.
To enable us to contact others in the event of an emergency.
