Lasell University Information Privacy Statement
Privacy Policy
Consumer Information Policies
Lasell University is committed to preserving and maintaining the privacy of visitors to its websites. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Lasell.edu and sites within the Lasell.edu domain signified by the address "lasell.edu."
What Information is Captured when you Visit Lasell.edu? When you access the Lasell website, your visit is not tracked by anything personally identifiable. Some computer information and automatic and optional information is collected.
Automatic information includes:
Client information: the Internet domain and Internet address (IP address) of the computer you are using.
Essential technical information: identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using, device you are using, and other relevant technical information.
This information is used to administer the website by understanding which parts of our site are most heavily used and what traffic comes from within the Lasell network.
User information may be shared with third-party partners to the extent necessary to provide and improve web services or other communications to users. Any third parties who receive user information for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services to users.
We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.
Optional information is collected only if you choose to send it. For example, if you choose to complete an online form, make an online purchase, or send an e-mail. This may include:
The time that you sent an e-mail
Your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail
All the data you choose to fill in or confirm, including credit or debit card information if you are making a payment or donation, as well as information about other people if you are ordering a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient's address.
How We Use Cookies Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, enable single-sign-on for other Lasell applications, and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
How We Use Third-Party Cookies Cookies may be set by an organization other than Lasell. These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus or other social media services for which Lasell.edu has implemented "plug-ins." Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly. You may disable cookies through your individual browser options.
Remarketing Lasell uses AdWords Remarketing to present online ads to visitors after they leave the Lasell.edu domain. AdWords Remarketing is a service provided by Google that connects the activity of Lasell.edu with the AdWords advertising network and the Doubleclick Cookie. You can opt out of the cookie tracking on Google's site.
Links to Other Sites The Lasell website contains links to many third-party sites which are beyond our control. Lasell University is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third-party sites.
Important Technical Information Lasell follows industry-standard precautions and procedures in the transmission and storage of electronic data. When you make online payments, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server software in conjunction with your SSL-enabled-browser software prevents unauthorized access to the information you submit by encrypting it during transmission. While we remain committed to protecting the privacy of our users, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We do so by using secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access.
Accuracy of Information All information provided on the official Lasell web site is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a legal contract between the institution and any other person or entity otherwise specified.
Although every reasonable effort is made to present current and accurate information and to monitor web content for compliance with institutional policy, Lasell makes no guarantees of any kind, nor does it take institutional responsibility for undetected, noncompliant conditions created without its knowledge or consent and in violation of its policy. Information on www.lasell.edu is subject to change without prior notice.
Changes to Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. The effective date of this policy was November 29, 2016.
