Student Organization
University Of Cincinnati Clermont Association Of Paralegal Students (UCCAPS)
What is our goal?
Our goal is to bring together the paralegal students at UC Clermont, to enhance our legal education by providing experiences outside of the classroom, and to promote connection to the legal community.
Activities:
Meetings are held on evenings and during the day.
If you live in Clermont County and would like to take the Notary exam on our campus, please contact a UCCAPS officer ASAP. The Clermont County law library has agreed to administer the exam on our campus so long as we have enough participants. You need to fill out an application to submit to the law library. The fee for the test is $50.
Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public, except as permitted by law.
The University of Cincinnati reaffirms its policy that discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or gender identity and expression shall not be practiced in any of its activities. University Rule 3361: 10-13-01
