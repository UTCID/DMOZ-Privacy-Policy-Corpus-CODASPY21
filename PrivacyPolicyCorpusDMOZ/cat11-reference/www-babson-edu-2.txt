E-mail Spoofing/Hoaxes/Scams
Please be advised that there have been reports of new e-mail scams being sent to Babson e-mail addresses. View a screenshot of a recent scam e-mail. Please remember to take extreme caution when opening any e-mails or clicking on links from unknown senders.
Password Change Policy
ITSD is moving to refine our security measures in response to auditor requests, industry best practices and state/federal regulations. In order to help keep our systems protected we are implementing two new practices to help ensure the security of Babson accounts.
Password Reset Policy
You will be required to update your password more frequently (how often depends on if you are a student, staff or faculty member). The first time you login to Portal or webmail as of that date, you will be redirected to the password reset form on Portal. The form will open in a new window where you will be asked to enter a new password. Please note that you will not be able to continue through Portal without completing this change process. In order to minimize potential interruptions, we recommend that you update your password prior to the date of the mandatory password change (varies per user type).

Forgotten Password Procedure
In order to provide you with an easy and secure way of resetting your forgotten password, we are asking that you provide a secondary e-mail address. This e-mail address will be used to send you a password reset link (the e-mail will be used for this purpose only). If you do not provide a secondary e-mail address you will be required to reset your password in person at the IT Service Center located in Horn 220. A Babson OneCard will be required as means of proper identification. Provide a secondary e-mail address now.
