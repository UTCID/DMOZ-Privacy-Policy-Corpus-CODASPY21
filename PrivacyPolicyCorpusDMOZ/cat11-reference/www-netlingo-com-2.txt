Legal Disclaimer, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use
Legal Disclaimer - All terms or suggestions sent to NetLingo via the Web site, e-mail, post, fax and any other way become the property of NetLingo Inc. and can be reproduced without prior permission. Unlike other publishers who assert that dictionary words are included on the basis of their usage and that any investigation of common-law trademark rights is impracticable, we've made every effort here to accurately source copyright and reprint information, and to identify companies who own trademarks, to annotate those trademarks, and to source information that may have come from other sources. However, if you see an omission or error, please advise us. The inclusion of any word in NetLingo is not necessarily an expression of the publisher's opinion as to whether or not it is subject to any proprietary rights, meaning no definition in this dictionary is to be regarded as affecting the validity of any trademark.
Privacy Policy - NetLingo uses the services of third-party ad networks for the delivery of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, these ad networks collect anonymous data typically through the use of cookies. Because NetLingo is committed to keeping your personal information private, we have made agreements with the ad network companies to ensure they will not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to them. This means that you can visit any of the ad banners without telling anyone who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. If you do submit personal information, it will be stored on the ad networks' Web servers and will not be publicly accessible (it is only accessed by ad network employees on a "need to know" basis). Anonymous clickstream information may be collected, this includes pages viewed, date and time, and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. The information is typically used by an ad network to build anonymous behavioral profiles, which are written to their databases and are accessed by the ad network to offer users personalized content and promotions, and to target relevant, more interesting ads -- all without knowing a user's identity. Cookies are used to identify your browser as you visit pages on the ad network, again to gather anonymous clickstream information in order to provide more relevant, targeted advertising as you travel through Web sites in the ad network. Their legal disclaimer includes their ability to disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on an ad network.
In summary, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
