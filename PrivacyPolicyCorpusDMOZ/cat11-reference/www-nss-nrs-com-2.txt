CREDIT CARD SECURITY:
When you submit your credit card, ASHA account number, and other sensitive information to Northern Speech Services, rest assured that the transaction is secure. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), one of the most robust encryption platforms available. SSL technology works with all different web browsers and encrypts your private information from the moment you enter it until your transaction is processed. Your personal information will not be saved on a public server, thus safeguarding your personal information and guaranteeing privacy. PCI Compliance Verified with Sysnet.
If you still feel unsure about sending your information via the internet, please feel free to call us (888-337-3866) and we can take this information over the phone.
ALTERNATIVES TO SENDING YOUR CREDIT CARD OVER THE INTERNET:
We offer the option of phoning, faxing or mailing in your information after you place your order for products, Online Courses, or Live Courses. Our system will generate prepared order forms which you can print and fax or mail.
HANDLING YOUR ORDER:
Every effort is made to handle your order in a timely manner. Our goal is to ship within 1-3 working days.
PAYMENT METHODS:
We accept checks (US dollars only), money orders, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and purchase orders for products, Online Courses, and Live Courses. If you prefer not to register online, call 888-337-3866.
SHIPPING YOUR ORDER:
US Domestic - Orders are shipped via UPS or USPS. Rates for both services are based on current published rates. Please use our shipping estimator (available in the shopping cart) to determine your shipping costs, based on your preferences.
International - Orders are shipped via USPS. Duties and taxes are NOT included in the shipping cost. Some countries impose additional duties and taxes when packages cross their borders. Please check your local laws, as any additional charges (duties/taxes), may be due upon delivery of your package. NSS is not responsible for any additional charges.
Tracking information will be emailed to you upon order shipping.
BACKORDERED ITEMS:
If an item is not in stock when your order is received but will be in stock within one week, we may ship a partial order with a notation on the packing slip indicating the backordered item(s). If the item will take longer than a week, we will call or email to let you know. It is not always possible for us to estimate how long a backordered item will take to fill, but generally, they are shipped within 1-2 weeks. If you placed an order with a Purchase Order, your invoice will not be sent until the order is completely filled. If a partial shipment is not acceptable to you, please let us know.
THERAPY MATERIALS VOLUME DISCOUNTS:
Help your School District, Private Practice, Hospital, or Clinic save money! Contact Us for a quote on 10 or more of any one NSS-Published Therapy Materials.
LIVE COURSE CANCELLATIONS:
Tuition will be refunded less a $25 processing fee if written notification is received by NSS up to two weeks prior to the course. Two weeks to 72 hours prior to course date = 50% refund; 72 hours or less = no refund. At any time, a voucher for the full registration amount can be requested instead of a refund. A voucher can be redeemed for a Live Course or Online Course/s registration and must be used within one year. NSS reserves the right to cancel the event 7 days prior to the Live Course date.

If you have not received your order, you may cancel it by calling 888-337-3866, faxing 888-696-9655, or emailing info@northernspeech.com.
