1.3 Statistics Cookies
We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files containing information that can be stored on the user's device via the browser when visiting a website. The information stored in cookies can be read out and processed when the website is visited again using the same device. In doing so, we use processing and storage functions of the browser of your device and collect information from the storage of the browser of your device.
In the structure of our Privacy Policy, we differentiate between Technically Required Cookies, Statistics Cookies and Social Media Content from Third Party Providers.
Depending on their function and purpose, the use of certain cookies may require the user's consent. Your consent is given through a so-called "cookie banner": When you visit our website, we display our cookie banner. In our cookie banner you can declare your consent to the use of all cookies requiring consent on this website by clicking on the "Accept" button. Without such consent, the cookies requiring consent are not activated. By clicking the "Close" button, you can also completely reject the use of cookies requiring consent. Your decision will be saved in a cookie. Alternatively, you have the possibility to access our "cookie board" by clicking on the "More information" button. In the cookie board, you can make an individual selection of cookies and customize them at a later time. We store your cookie settings in the form of a cookie on your device in order to determine whether you have already made cookie settings the next time you visit the website.
a) Google Analytics
If you have given your consent, we use the web analysis tool Google Analytics on our website. With the help of Google Analytics, we can analyze the user behaviour of visitors to our website in pseudonymized and anonymised form.
You can deactivate the data processing by Google Analytics at any time in our "cookie board". Alternatively, you can install a browser plug-in from Google which prevents data collection by Google Analytics: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
The purpose of data processing is to analyze user behaviour and to measure the reach of our website and advertisements to optimize our website.
The processed data are: Google Analytics HTTP data: This is protocol data that is generated for technical reasons when using the web analysis tool Google Analytics via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) (HTTP(S)) used on the website: This includes IP address, type and version of your Internet browser, operating system used, the page visited, the page previously visited (referrer URL), date and time of the visit. Google Analytics device data: Data generated by the web analysis tool Google Analytics and assigned to your device: This includes a unique ID for the (re-)recognition of returning visitors (so-called "client ID") as well as certain technical parameters for controlling data collection for web analysis. Google Analytics measurement data: Device-related raw data (so-called "dimensions" and " measurement results"), which are collected and analysed by the web analysis tool Google Analytics when using our website: This includes, above all, information about the sources through which visitors reach our website, information about the location, the browser and the device used, information about the use of the website (in particular page views, frequency of visits and length of stay on accessed pages) as well as information about the fulfilment of certain purposes (in particular transactions in the online shop). The data is assigned to the client ID assigned to your device. As a result, device-related usage profiles are created in which all device-related raw data is combined into a client ID. The data that we collect using Google Analytics does not enable us to identify you personally (i.e. by your civil name). We also do not merge the device-related raw data and the resulting device-related usage profiles with data that directly identifies you personally without your consent. Google Analytics report data: Data contained in aggregated segment and device-related reports generated by the Google Analytics web analysis tool based on the analysis of device-related raw data. The legal basis for the processing is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent).
Data is automatically transmitted by the browser of the user.
The recipient of the data is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland, which we use as processor within the framework of a data processing agreement. Google Ireland Limited uses Google LLC in the USA (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) as its service provider. The basis for data processing in the USA is your consent granted through the cookie banner (Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR). In the USA, there is no level of data protection comparable to the provisions of the GDPR. It is possible that US authorities may access personal data without us or you being informed. An enforcement of your rights is probably not possible in the USA. You can withdraw your given consent at any time with effect for the future through the Cookie Board.
The data will be deleted after 14 months.
The provision of data is not required by law or contract or necessary for the conclusion of a contract. There is no obligation on the data subject to provide the data. If the data is not provided, we cannot make web analysis using Google Analytics.
1.4 Social Media Content from Third Party Providers

The collection and processing of this data is the sole responsibility of Soundcloud Limited, 20 Old Bailey, London, EC4M 7 AN, United Kingdom.
On our website there are links to audio files that are stored and retrievable at Soundcloud. As soon as you activate the checkbox in the cookie banner or cookie board, the file is loaded by Soundcloud. Technically, the same thing happens then as would happen if you clicked a link to go to the Soundcloud website: Soundcloud receives all information that your browser automatically transmits (including your IP address). Soundcloud also sets its own cookies on your device. This also happens if you do not have a Soundcloud user account. If you are logged in to Soundcloud, your data is directly associated with your account. If you do not want your profile to be associated with your Soundcloud account, you must log out of Soundcloud before activating the checkbox.
We have no knowledge of further details on the processing of personal data or a possible data processing in the USA in the area of data controllership of Soundcloud. Hertie School has no influence on the data processing of Soundcloud.

We then integrate videos stored at Youtube on our website. During this integration, the contents of the YouTube website are displayed in parts of a browser window. However, the YouTube videos are only accessed by clicking on the video separately. The integration of Youtube content is carried out in the so-called "extended data protection mode". This is provided by Google as the provider of YouTube, thus ensuring that no data is transmitted to Google and no cookies are stored on your device before you click in the cookie banner or cookie board to play the video.
As soon as you activate the corresponding checkbox in the cookie banner or cookie board, the video is loaded from Youtube. Technically, the same thing happens then as if would happen if you clicked a link to go to the Youtube website: Youtube receives all information that your browser automatically transmits (including your IP address). Furthermore, Youtube sets its own cookies on your device. This also happens if you do not have a Youtube user account. If you are logged in at Youtube or Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. If you do not want the assignment to your user account at Youtube or Google, you have to log out at Youtube and Google before activation the corresponding checkboxes in the cookie banner or cookie board.
The collection and processing of this data is the sole responsibility of responsibility of Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.

As soon as you activate the corresponding checkboxes in the cookie banner or in the cookie board for displaying Twitter content, the content will be loaded from Twitter. Technically, the same thing happens then as would happen if you clicked a link to go to the Twitter website: Twitter receives all information that your browser automatically transmits (including your IP address). Twitter also sets its own cookies on your device. This also happens if you do not have a Twitter user account. If you are logged in to Twitter, your data will be assigned directly to your account.
