The Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a broad disclosure law that requires the university to make many of its records publicly available upon request. Library records, however, get special protection under Michigan law, which specifically shields library records from FOIA.
A “library record” is a document, record, or other method of storing information retained by a library that contains information that personally identifies a library patron, including the patron's name, address, or telephone number, or that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific materials from a library.
De-identified and aggregated data that does not include identifying material is not protected by Michigan law and is subject to FOIA. You can file a FOIA request for such information through the university’s Freedom of Information Act Office.
Please direct questions about privacy and confidentiality to Ask a Librarian or LibraryPrivacyPolicy@umich.edu.
