Privacy Policy Disclosure
NIST International School (hereafter referred to as NIST or the School) strongly believes in safeguarding the wellbeing of its community. To that end, our school invests significant resources in protecting the privacy of our staff, parents and children. In order to ensure that we achieve this aim, we have adopted the following policy in line with international privacy standards.
Definitions
Staff are individuals employed by NIST in any capacity, including full-time and part-time employees. This excludes contracted companies and individuals.
Students are current, prospective or past students enrolled at NIST.
Parents are current, prospective or past parents, and/or legal guardians, of a student or students at NIST.
Alumni are former NIST students and/or graduates.
Where applicable in the policy, alumni will be differentiated between those over the age of 18 and those under the age of 18.
Third parties are individuals or organizations that are not affiliated with or employed by NIST.
Personal information constitutes the full legal name, personal address, personal contact information and school records of an individual. It does not include identification numbers, names of staff, or titles and business contact information of staff.
Policies
NIST will make these policies publicly accessible, and will make every reasonable effort to ensure that all personal information is accurate and protected. This includes the storing of all personal information only in password-protected databases.
Personal information of students, parents and staff of NIST is stored within Veracross. Veracross LLC maintains a privacy policy that has been certified by TRUSTe Privacy Standards and can be accessed at veracross.com/privacy-policy.
Personal information of alumni is stored within 360Alumni. 360Alumni maintains a privacy policy that can be accessed at 360alumni.com/privacy-policy.
All staff, parents, students and alumni agree upon initiating their relationship with NIST that the School shall keep their personal information on file in Veracross for the duration of their time as members of the School community as a matter of academic record, evidence of services rendered and/or as evidence of employment.
NIST may publicly disclose non-personal information of staff, including titles, business addresses, and business contact information. Personal information will be disclosed to third parties only with the consent of that member of staff.
In line with the US Department of Education’s Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), NIST will not disclose the personal information of a student to third parties without the consent of the student’s parent. Personal information of an alumnus or alumna will not disclose the personal information to third parties without the consent of that alumnus or alumna. This excludes non-identifiable disclosure of academic records for the purposes of accreditation, academic research, statistical analysis, and disclosure under subpoena by Thai law.
As indicated in the NIST enrollment documents, NIST reserves the right to use photographs and other visual media containing the images of NIST parents, students and alumni in online and print media. In such cases the school will not post the full legal names of students or alumni who have yet to reach the age of 18 with that media, unless permission is granted from parents, to preserve their privacy.
Instances of online media include, but are not limited to, the NIST website, social media channels such as Facebook, news sites that publish NIST press releases, and third parties which have been granted permission by NIST for the purposes of promotion of education-related content.
Instances of print media include, but are not limited to, school brochures and flyers, the school magazine, advertisements, newspapers and magazines that publish NIST press releases, and third parties which have been granted permission by NIST for the purposes of promotion of education-related content.
In cases in which published media, whether in online or print form, utilizes extensive interviews with students, further consent will be sought from the parents of those students.
As a not-for-profit school that provides educational services within the Kingdom of Thailand, to a degree NIST falls outside the scope of the the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, the School abides by the GDPR in respect to the processing of personal information of European Union residents who repatriate and/or offer donations to NIST:
The personal information of all European Union residents who repatriate following enrollment or employment at NIST will be stored in Veracross as per the agreement signed during the enrollment and re-enrollment processes, and/or the employment contract. Should any individual wish to exercise the right to be forgotten, their account in Veracross shall be stripped of identifiable information. The identification number, role classification and, if applicable, academic records shall remain on file.
All European Union residents who are donors to NIST will be asked to give special consent when receiving or storing their personal information for any purpose, including, but not limited to, record keeping, publication or other purposes appropriate to the School’s operations.
Cookies & Tracking
NIST utilizes Google Analytics in tracking visitors to the NIST website. This information is not used to identify personal information, nor is it used for any purpose other than improvement of the website based on identifiable trends. Cookies – small pieces of information stored on your computer to indicate sites that you have visited – are used only in conjunction with Google Analytics for the purpose of enhancing the NIST website. These cookies are not used to gather personal information about visitors, and no other visitor tracking is conducted. Additional information about Google Analytics and privacy is available on the Google Support website.
