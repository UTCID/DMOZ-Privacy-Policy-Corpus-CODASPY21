Overview
The Kennedy Krieger Institute ("Kennedy Krieger" or “the Institute”) (also referred to as "we", "us", and "our") respects the online privacy of its members and other visitors ("you") to this www.KennedyKrieger.org (the "Site") and our other websites, Helpkids.KennedyKrieger.org, FestivalOfTrees.KennedyKrieger.org, and SupportUs.KennedyKrieger.org (collectively, the "Sites").
This Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy (the "Policy") describes the information we collect through the use of cookies and similar technologies, how and why we use cookies and similar technologies, how our third party business partners use cookies and similar technologies, and ways you can opt out of using cookies and similar technologies. Our Privacy Policy, of which this Policy is part, is available at https://www.kennedykrieger.org/about-us/policies-standards/privacy-policy and provides further information about our privacy practices.
What Is A Cookie?
A "cookie" is a small text file stored on your device when you use a website (Adobe’s line). created by a web server that can be stored on a user's device for use either during a particular ("session" cookie) or future ("persistent" cookie) browsing session. This file may include information about internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), URLs of any referring or exited webpages, operating system, and/or date and time stamps.
Kennedy Krieger uses cookies to enable certain website functions, develop web browsing analytics, store and track your preferences, and enable the delivery of advertising and marketing, when applicable. For example, we track the number of “hits” or visits to our Websites, the most popular times of day and sections visited, and the range of devices and browsers most commonly used to view the Websites. Kennedy Krieger does not sell any of this information to third parties.
First-Party Cookies
First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting, and they can only be read by that site. Certain features of our Website use session and persistent cookies.
"Session" cookies are temporarily stored on your hard drive and only last until they expire at the end of your browsing session or after a set time period. Our Website's session cookies are set to expire in 12 hours and are required for log in to access secure areas of the Website and to process e-commerce transactions. "Permanent" cookies remain stored on a user's hard drive until they expire or are deleted by a user. We use permanent browser cookies on our Website for log-in purposes and to recover certain preferences set for use by you during repeated visits to our Website. They are set to time out within 6 months.
Third-Party Cookies
You also may encounter third-party cookies on our Website. Third-Party Cookies are cookies that are stored on your web browser by a party other than Kennedy Krieger and may gather browsing activity (such as information you have entered or choices you have made) across numerous websites that you visit and across numerous browsing sessions. These cookies also help improve how Kennedy Krieger’s Websites and services function and perform, customize your interaction with our Websites, and help provide more relevant messaging and marketing communications to you. The Institute is currently using third-party cookies for a range of purposes, as described below under “HOW DOES KENNEDY KRIEGER USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES.” If you wish to delete Third-Party Cookies, you should adjust your browser settings as described in the "CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION" section of this Policy.
Kennedy Krieger also uses third-party ad targeting to display ads for the Institute’s programs and services that may be of interest to you and to track the performance of the advertisements. This service is able to follow users to third-party websites not affiliated with Kennedy Krieger and displays ads when users visit those other sites. For example, our Website uses Addthis social media cookies to allow you to share content from our Website across your social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you browse the internet while signed into a social network, that network may have the ability to collect information about the websites you are visiting, including ours.

How Does Kennedy Krieger Use Cookies And Similar Technologies?
Like most websites, as you navigate through and interact with our Website, we may passively collect information about your browsing activities using cookies and other automatic data collection technologies, such as Internet tags, or web beacons (clear gifs., pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, etc.), to improve website functionality and analytics.
Web Beacons: These are tiny graphics (sometimes called "clear GIFs" or "web pixels" with a unique identifier that are used to understand browsing activity. In contract to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are rendered invisible on web pages when you open a page.
Social Widgets: These are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers that allow you to interact with those social media services when you view a web page or mobile app screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget and are controlled by third parties.
UTM Codes: These are strings that can appear in a URL (the "Uniform Resource Locator", which is typically the http or https address entered to go to a web page) when a user moves from one web page or website to another, where the string can represent information about browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher sent the user to the receiving website.
The aggregate data collected by these passive technologies typically does not target any personally identifying information (PII) or other personal data, but personal information we store about you may be linked to information stored in and obtained from cookies in order to improve our marketing, analytics, or website functionality.
