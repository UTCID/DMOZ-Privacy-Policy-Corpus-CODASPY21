Typically, this step is all that is necessary to resolve any disagreements.  This step is only to be waived if the student believes she or he cannot meet with the instructor.In the event that informal resolution is not satisfactory to the student, the student has the burden of proof to show that the grade was based on factors listed in General Principles (2) above. The student submits a "Student Grade Change" form (located in e-trieve) for a grade appeal to the Registrar’s Office within six weeks of the official posting of the grades by the Registrar’s Office. The student must include evidence pertinent to the General Principles (2) above in support of the grade appeal request.The Registrar’s Office provides copies of the appeal to the program director (or the school dean if the program director is the instructor) and the instructor.  Within 15 days, the instructor responds in writing to the program director (or school dean), explaining the basis for the grade. Please note that days during the faculty off-contract periods (e.g. summer) are not counted.Within three weeks of the grade appeal request, the program director (or school dean) appoints a grade appeals panel consisting of three faculty members.  The panel will reach a decision to either uphold the grade or change it.  This decision is sent to the Registrar’s Office which then informs the program director (or school dean) the instructor, and the student.  The panel’s decision is binding.Incomplete GradeStudents must arrange for an Incomplete with their instructor and dean, complete the Incomplete Grade Request form and submit it to the Registrar’s Office.Registrar's OfficePhone: 559-453-2037 Fax: 559-453-3676 registrar@fresno.eduPhone HoursMon - Fri: 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:00a.m. - 12:00p.m.Office HoursMon - Fri: 8:30a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:30a.m. - 12:00p.m.StudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentral
