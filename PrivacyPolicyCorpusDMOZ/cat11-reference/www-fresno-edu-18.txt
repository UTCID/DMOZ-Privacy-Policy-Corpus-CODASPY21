Following are the procedures for the challenging of the contents of education records:A student must ask the Registrar of Fresno Pacific University in writing to amend a record. In so doing, the student should identify the part of the record they want changed and specify why they believe it is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of his or her privacy or other rights.Fresno Pacific University chooses whether or not to comply with the request. If it decides not to comply, Fresno Pacific University will notify the student of the decision and advise them of their right toa formal hearing to challenge the information believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy or other rights.Upon request, Fresno Pacific University will arrange for a hearing, and notify the student, reasonably in advance, of the date, place, and time of the hearing.A hearing officer who is a disinterested party will conduct the hearing; however, the hearing officer may be an official of the institution. The student shall be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised in the original request to amend the student's education records. One or more individuals may assist the student, including an attorney, at the student's expense.Fresno Pacific University will prepare a written decision based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. The decision will include a summary of the evidence presented and the reasons for the decision.If Fresno Pacific University decides that the challenged information is not inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's privacy or other rights, it will notify the student that they have a right to place in the record a statement commenting on the challenged information and/or a statement setting forth reasons for disagreeing with the decision.The statement will be maintained as part of the student's education records as long as the contested portion is maintained. If Fresno Pacific University discloses the contested portion of the record, it must also disclose the statement.If Fresno Pacific University decides that the information is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's right of privacy, it will amend the record and notify the student, in writing, that the record has been amended.4 The right to challenge grades does not apply unless the grade assigned was inaccurately recorded, under which condition the record will be corrected.Registrar's OfficePhone: 559-453-2037 Fax: 559-453-3676 registrar@fresno.eduPhone HoursMon - Fri: 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:00a.m. - 12:00p.m.Office HoursMon - Fri: 8:30a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:30a.m. - 12:00p.m.StudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentral
