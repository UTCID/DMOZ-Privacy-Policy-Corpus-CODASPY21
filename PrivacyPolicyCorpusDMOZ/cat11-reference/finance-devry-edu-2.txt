I applied for financial aid last year, would I need to reapply this year?
Yes, if you choose to explore financial aid as a potential way to pay for your education, you will need to reapply for financial aid every year. Depending on your financial situation, it may differ from year to year.
How do I obtain more information about education tax credits?
You may be eligible for credit that could save you money at tax time. To learn about education tax credits and other tax information for students please visit www.irs.gov.
What happens to my financial aid if I withdraw?
According to federal regulations, a federal refund calculation must be performed if a student withdraws completely from all classes after the start of the enrollment period.
