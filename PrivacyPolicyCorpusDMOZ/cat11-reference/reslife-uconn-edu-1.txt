The University of Connecticut Department of Residential Life works to ensure that students who are interested in on-campus housing have the ability to apply and be guaranteed housing on an expedited basis. However, circumstances arise after an application process is complete that may cause a student to no longer be interested in living on-campus for the timeframe that they are contractually obligated for, at which time the cancellation process must be followed.
Please review the information below to help you determine the best plan for you to cancel an application, as well as any fees associated with each time frame. Your confirmation email from your housing application process will share the date that you officially applied for housing.
All students who are not living in their housing assignment must submit a cancellation application so that Residential Life is aware that you are not living on-campus for the semester. Once your records are updated in our system you will receive a confirmation email.
