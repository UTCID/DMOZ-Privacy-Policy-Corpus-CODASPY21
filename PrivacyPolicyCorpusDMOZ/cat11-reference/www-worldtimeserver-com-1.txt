Privacy Policy for WorldTimeServer.com
At WorldTimeServer.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is
important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive
and collect when you use and visit WorldTimeServer.com, and how we safeguard your
information.
Above all, we want you to know that we never sell your personal information to third parties!
Log Files
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.
The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address,
your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Verizon), the browser you used
to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our
site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
The information in our log files is used simply to monitor our WorldTimeServer.com
web site to both ensure it is performing as we expect and to help troubleshoot any
problems when they crop up.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We use first-party cookies from WorldTimeServer.com to store information, but this
information is limited to just what is needed to remember your personal preferences
when you visit our site.
We also use third party advertisements on WorldTimeServer.com to support our site.
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when
they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google
through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your
ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have
Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing
New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain
ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who
frequents cooking sites).
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies
in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in security/antivirus/firewall
programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you
are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include
the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
Google has a privacy policy for the Google Ads which run on WorldTimeServer.com,
which you can review
at http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html .
Google is using a DoubleClick cookie on Adsense partner sites like WorldTimeServer.com, but if you
would like to opt-out, you will find instructions in the Google privacy policy.
Contact Us
We have asked our adverisers to not use pop-ups, pop-unders or interstitial pages, as we find them as
annoying as you do! Advertising, however, does provide the funding to keep WorldTimeServer.com up and
running for everyone.
If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to Contact Us or
