FAQs
I have a coronavirus question
Please see our dedicated COVID-19 FAQ page.
What is Techniquest?
Techniquest is an educational charity, with a science centre in Cardiff Bay. Our mission is to embed science in Welsh culture through interactive engagement. We provide a range of services to schools and teachers to complement formal education provision in Wales and work extensively with public audiences.
Where can I park?
We are pleased to be able to offer all of our visitors discounted parking with Q-Park, our preferred parking partner.
The Q-Park operates the Cardiff Bay car park in Pierhead Street which is around 8 minutes walk from Techniquest.
We have agreed a special discount rate for our customers of 15% off all pre-bookings.
Pre-book and guarantee your space here using the code TECHNI15.
There are also nearby pay-and-display car parks on Stuart Street and Havannah Street. Please do not park on Havannah Street itself.
Who is it for?
Techniquest is suitable for all ages! We do have special events for certain groups, however — see Toddler Days, After Hours and Home Educator days.
