The methods used in web site administration in relation to processing of site users’ personal data are described below.
This notice is provided in accordance with art. 13 of Legislative Decree no. 196 of June 30, 2003 (hereafter referred to as the Privacy Code) to all those who interact with the site’s web services (excluding external web sites linked on the site).
This notice is also inspired by Recommendation no. 2/2001 of the European Personal Data Protection Authorities, combined in the Group set up under art. 29 of Directive no. 95/46/EC, adopted on May 17, 2001 to identify certain minimum requirements for on-line personal data collection.
Data controller
Data on identified or identifiable persons may be obtained during use of this web site.
The data controller is the owner of the site, as identified at the bottom of each page on the site.
Data processing location
Data connected with this site’s web services is processed at the location identified below, and is processed only by the persons in charge of data processing. No personal data from the web service will be disclosed. The personal data supplied by users is used exclusively for the purposes of providing the service requested and will be disclosed to third parties only if strictly necessary for this purpose.
Types of data processed
1) Browsing data
Information systems and software procedures used in the functioning of this web site acquire certain items of personal data in the course of their regular operations, the transmission of which is implicit in the use of the Internet based on the TCP/IP protocol. This is information which is not collected to be associated with identified data subjects, but which could, due to its nature, permit identification of users browsing the site through processing and association with data held by third parties. This category of data includes "IP addresses" or domain names of computers used by users connecting to the site, addresses of requested resources in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the web server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code identifying the status of the response given by the web server (success, error, etc…) and other parameters on the user’s operating system and computing environment. This data will be used solely in order to obtain anonymous statistical information on
site use and to check that the web site is functioning properly. Note that data of this type may be used to determine responsibility in the event of computer crimes damaging the web site or other connected or related web sites; other than in this case, data on web contacts is not currently held for more than a few days.
2) Data supplied voluntarily by the user
Requests to send e-mail to addresses indicated in the appropriate section of this web site result in acquisition of certain personal data on the person submitting the request, including the person’s email address, required to respond to the request.
3) Cookies
Cookies are not used to transmit personal information, and no persistent cookies or systems for tracing users of any kind are employed. Use of so-called session cookies (which are not permanently memorised on the user’s computer and are normally deleted when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to transmission of session identifiers necessary to permit safe, efficient browsing of the site. These session cookies used on this web site do not resort to other forms of information technology which could potentially compromise the confidentiality of users’ browsing and do not acquire personal data identifying the user.
Providing personal data
Apart from the specified cases of browsing data, users are free to provide or not provide the personal data listed in electronic request forms in the section of the web site for requesting particular services. Failure to provide this data may, however, make it impossible to fulfil the request.
Data processing methods and security measures
Personal data is processed using automated and other tools solely for the amount of time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which the data is collected. Specific security measures are applied to prevent loss of data, unlawful or incorrect use and unauthorised access.
Data subjects' rights
Data subjects of the personal data collected as described in the above sections are entitled to obtain confirmation of the existence or non-existence of data on them at any time and to know their content and origin, check their accuracy and request integration, updating or correction of the data under art. 7 of the Privacy Code.
The data subject is entitled to request deletion or transformation into anonymous form of the data and to object to processing of data with legitimate reason.
Requests of this type should be sent by post or email to the address shown at the bottom of this page.
