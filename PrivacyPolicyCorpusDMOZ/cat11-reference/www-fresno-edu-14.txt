Personally identifiable information includes direct identifiers such as social security number as well as indirect identifiers such as the name of the student’s parent or family member that would allow a reasonable person in the community to identify the student with reasonable certainty. FPU will enter into a written agreement with the recipient organization, specifying the purposes of the study. The written agreement will specify that:the information from the education records may only be used to meet the purposes of the study stated in the written agreement,the records must not be disclosed, andthe information must be destroyed upon completion of the study.The university will not release information that is requested by a person who the institution reasonably believes has direct, personal knowledge of the identity of the student to whom the education record directly relates without the student’s consent.Registrar's OfficePhone: 559-453-2037 Fax: 559-453-3676 registrar@fresno.eduPhone HoursMon - Fri: 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:00a.m. - 12:00p.m.Office HoursMon - Fri: 8:30a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:30a.m. - 12:00p.m.StudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentral
