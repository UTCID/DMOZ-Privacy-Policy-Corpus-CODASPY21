Please check these Terms regularly because we may modify them from time to time by posting the modified Terms on this page, or if we determine that it is appropriate, we may post a notice of the change on our home page. Your continued use of Our Site after we have posted amended Terms indicates that you agree to the amended Terms. If you have questions about these Terms, please feel free to contact us by sending an email to webmaster@nais.org.
Privacy and Security Statement

NAIS member schools may print or electronically reproduce content from Our Site for distribution among school employees, staff, board members, committees or other staff related to the school unless otherwise provided.
Except for the foregoing, you may not copy, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, modify or create derivative works of or in any way exploit or use materials on Our Site (or any computer programs and other coding) without NAIS's express prior written permission in each case.
Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
We intend that all material posted on Our Site respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties.  However, we cannot monitor the copyright ownership of all material posted on Our Site.  If you believe that any material posted on Our Site infringes your copyright, then you may request the removal of those materials from Our Site in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), and the procedures described below.
A notice of infringing material that complies with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) ("Notice") must be sent to the agent below:
Communications
National Association of Independent Schools
1129 20th Street, NW, Suite 800
Washington, DC 20036
Or
webmaster@nais.org
To comply with the Copyright Act, your Notice must be in writing and must include the following:
A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
When we receive a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will remove the identified material immediately.  We will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the "alleged infringer") of the Notice and subsequent removal.  The alleged infringer may then provide us with a counter-notice ("Counter-Notice) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous.  Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include:
A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer;
Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

The alleged infringer's name, address, and telephone number; and
A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent.
Upon receipt of a Counter-Notice, we will notify you of the Counter-Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days of receipt of the Counter-Notice, unless you inform us that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Our Site.
