We are a team of NHS professionals trained to specialize in offering effective, evidence-based treatments for a wide range of common problems that affect most of us at some point in our lives. We specialize in all symptoms of anxiety, and low mood (depression), but we also deliver physical rehabilitation programmes for physical conditions, and help people to live better with long term physical conditions. We treat both emotional and physical symptoms together – because we all experience both in our lives. Our team is made up of Wellbeing Practitioners, Nurse Therapists, Cognitive Behavioural Therapists, and Counsellors. We have been delivering effective treatment in North Staffordshire since 2008.
