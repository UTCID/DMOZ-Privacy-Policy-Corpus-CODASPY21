Eat as a Group: Save $2 per person on adult admission when visiting the Historic Village if also dining at the Barn Restaurant as a group.
Eat on Your Own: We will put your names on the list of those waiting to be seated. Please note, if this is your choice, there will be no complimentary meals for your escort and delays are possible.
