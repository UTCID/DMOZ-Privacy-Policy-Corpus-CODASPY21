If you do not agree with any of these terms of use, you are prohibited from using or accessing the Website. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.
Use of the Website.
You may use the Website only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these terms of use.

You agree not to (i) post any content on the Website except with Cipher’s prior written consent; (ii) use the Website in any manner that could disable, impair, overburden, or damage the Website; (iii) attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software on the Website; or (iv) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Website.
Copyright Complaints and Copyright Agent.
Termination of Access for Infringers.  We respect the intellectual property rights of others and request that our users do the same.  Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section 512(i) of the United States Copyright Act, we have adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of users of this Website, its features and of Cipher’s products and services (whether made available through the Website or any other website or portal provided by Cipher) who are infringers.  We may terminate access for participants or users who are found to provide or post protected third party content without necessary rights and permissions.
DMCA Take-Down Notices.  If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe, in good faith, that any materials provided on or through this Website, its features, or any other website or portal provided by Cipher infringe upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (see 17 U.S.C. Section 512) (“DMCA”) by sending the following information in writing to our designated copyright agent:
The date of your notification;
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
A description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
A description of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information sufficient to enable us to locate such work;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and/or email address;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Upon receipt of a take-down notice, we will promptly remove the allegedly infringing material and will promptly notify the user who posted this material of the removal.  Our designated copyright agent is our Director of Business Operations.
Counter-Notices. If you believe that your user content that has been removed from the Website, or any other website or portal provided by Cipher is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to our copyright agent using the contact information set forth above:
Your physical or electronic signature;

A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in Maryland and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing such person that we may reinstate the removed material in 10 business days.  Unless our copyright agent receives notice from the complaining party of the complaining party filing or intending to file an action seeking a court order against us or the alleged infringer to restrain from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material at issue, we may replace the material in not less than 10, nor more than 14 business days from receipt of the counter-notice.
