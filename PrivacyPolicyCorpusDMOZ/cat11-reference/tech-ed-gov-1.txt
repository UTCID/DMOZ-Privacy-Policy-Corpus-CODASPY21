The U.S. Department of Education runs the Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) as a “one-stop” resource for answering questions and addressing concerns related to privacy, confidentiality, and security practices. PTAC provides timely information and updated guidance on privacy, confidentiality, and security practices through a variety of resources, including training materials and opportunities to receive direct assistance with privacy, security, and confidentiality of student data systems.

Uses & limitations of data under FERPA. (Data Quality Campaign)
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
FERPA is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds from the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
The primary goal of COPPA is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their young children online. COPPA was designed to protect children under age 13 while accounting for the dynamic nature of the Internet. The Rule applies to operators of commercial websites and online services (including mobile apps) directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children, and operators of general audience websites or online services with actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13. The Rule also applies to websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information directly from users of another website or online service directed to children.

Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)

Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA)
PPRA is intended to protect the rights of parents and students in two ways:
It seeks to ensure that schools and contractors make instructional materials available for inspection by parents if those materials will be used in connection with an ED-funded survey, analysis, or evaluation in which their children participate; and
It seeks to ensure that schools and contractors obtain written parental consent before minor students are required to participate in any ED-funded survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals certain information.
PPRA applies to programs that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Read more
