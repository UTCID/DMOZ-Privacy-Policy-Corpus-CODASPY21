Praxis Practice Tests by Exam Edge | Updated 2020
Teachers play an invaluable role in our society, sharing their knowledge and experience with the next generations. Of course, no teacher can take their turn at the lectern without first becoming certified. The Praxis exam is required for those hoping to become licensed as teachers. Intended to be one of the final hurdles in a prospective teacher's education, the Praxis is required by 44 different states for those seeking their teaching certificate.
Created by the Educational Testing Service, or ETS, the Praxis has been approved by the Council of Accreditation of Educator Preparation as a measure of a person's academic proficiency. As Common Core standards are embraced from coast to coast, the Praxis has become a popular choice for certifying teachers. While not every state requires educators to take the test, many will not consider teaching applicants without a passing Praxis score. Praxis practice tests can help you secure the score you need.

While it's easy to feel pressured to perform well, preparing for the Praxis doesn't have to be stressful. Thankfully, Exam Edge offers Praxis practice tests to help anyone who feels nervous about the exam ahead of time. Our library of practice exams allows users to hone their test-taking strategies while also reviewing the concepts and theories they learned in their training. In fact, studying for the Praxis can even be kind of fun thanks to Exam Edge's unique study tools. Whether you opt to take a timed version of the exam and turn on the pressure or choose to use an untimed practice test to review the material, our resources make it easy to prepare. Simple to use and more effective than traditional study methods, our Praxis practice tests are the ideal way to brush up on your teaching skills.
Praxis Practice Exams
The Praxis is made up of three different tests. The Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators quizzes prospective teachers on their general knowledge of reading, writing and mathematics fundamentals. This is perhaps the most popular version of the Praxis, and is one most educators will be required to take before they begin working with students. While it may seem like a straightforward, generalist exam, the Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators demands preparation. Without adequate study, you could be left with a failing score and a potential retake hanging over your head.
The Praxis II Subject Assessment exams are subject or grade specific, which helps ensure the prospective teacher has the depth of knowledge required to shape the minds of others. For instance, aspiring middle school science teachers are often required to take the Praxis Middle School Science (5440) exam before they can take a classroom teaching position. Whether you hope to man the school library or lead deaf students through their curriculum, there's a Praxis test available to qualify you for the job. The Praxis Content Knowledge for Teaching Assessment exams are less commonly required than the other two versions and test elementary teachers on their classroom technique. No matter which version you take, Praxis practice exams can help give you the confidence you need to pass with flying colors.
In many cases, educators will need to take more than one Praxis test. It can be dizzying trying to undergo Praxis exam prep for multiple standardized tests. Thankfully, we offer a number of practice tests that allow you to hone your test-taking skills for the specific content of the Praxis, Praxis II or Praxis Content Knowledge for Teaching Assessment exams. Just as you would encourage students to adequately prepare for a big exam, it's important to study for each of the three Praxis tests independent of one another. Praxis test prep can help ensure you're ready for whichever exam you might need to take.
Each licensing organization and state have their own method of certifying teachers. While the Praxis is among the most common assessments of teachers, others may be required in your state. The American Board of Certification for Teacher Excellence, for example, has a Professional Teaching Knowledge exam that is required for some positions. College professors may be required to take the College Basic Academic Subjects Examination.
Praxis Exam Prep
If you're feeling unsure about your Praxis prospects, consider taking advantage of Exam Edge's Praxis exam prep. With Exam Edge's exam prep, you can go into your big test with the confidence you need to pass with flying colors. An industry leader in Praxis test prep, Exam Edge simulates popular teaching certification tests to prepare you for the real thing. Still worried about if this is the right test for you? Don't be! Here at Exam Edge, we allow you to take one free sample Praxis practice test. It's the closest you can get to taking the actual Praxis! This cost-effective solution is great for anyone who'd like to take the exam multiple times but wants to save some cash.
We know how expensive it can be to become a certified teacher. Your time and money are valuable, which is why it's worth taking a few Praxis exam practice tests to ensure you pass the Praxis on your very first attempt. Those hoping to do well without studying will be in for a surprise when it comes to the day of the test! Instead of leaving your career to chance, take advantage of a practice exam to gauge your Praxis readiness.
Even better, our tests come scored and with a prediction of how you'll fare on the actual exam. With the results of your practice test, you can easily hone in on trouble areas and make a more efficient use of your studying time. Since certification exams test not only what you know but how well you perform under pressure, taking a practice test or two is always a good idea. When it comes to studying, Praxis exam practice tests are a no brainer.
Praxis Test Prep
Research has shown that practice tests are one of the most effective forms of study. By taking time to get to know the format, content and pacing of the practice exam, you'll prepare for the real thing in ways traditional studying cannot. While outlining chapters and reviewing flashcards can indeed be helpful, only practice tests give you first-hand experience with the exam material. Timed and untimed options on our website allow you the freedom to practice under pressure or at your own pace. Since our resources can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, it's never been easier to study on the go.
Don't let nerves get the best of you on test day. By taking several Praxis practice tests with Exam Edge, you'll naturally feel more self-assured about your Praxis scores. With the future of your career on the line, there's not much margin for error. With the right preparation, though, the test will be a breeze! Walk into your Praxis exam with confidence, knowing that you've taken the test before. Bring your studying to the next level with a little help from Exam Edge.
