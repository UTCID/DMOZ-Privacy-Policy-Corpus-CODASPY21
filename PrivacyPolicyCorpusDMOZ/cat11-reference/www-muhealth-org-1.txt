MU Health Care OHCA Participants
MU Health Care currently participates in an organized health care arrangement (OHCA) with other health care providers in central Missouri. We do this to enhance the delivery of care and care coordination to improve patient experience as they are treated jointly by health care providers.
The OHCA participants share access to MU Health Care’s electronic medical record and might, under certain circumstances, access your medical and billing information for treatment or health care operations purposes to improve, manage and coordinate your care without seeking your advance authorization, but only to the extent permitted by law.
The arrangement also enables participants to integrate patient portals into the MU Health Care portal, HEALTHConnect. The patient portal allows patients to securely message doctors, schedule appointments and access their health history across the shared electronic medical record system.
Current participants include:
