Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
The University of La Verne (ULV) is committed to respecting your privacy. ULV does not share personal information gathered from its web servers and we do not collect information about you other than connection information automatically obtained when visiting our website. Unless you choose to provide information to us via online forms, no personal data is stored on our servers.
This privacy policy explains how personal information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by ULV with respect to your use of the ULV websites where this policy is posted (collectively, “Sites”).
ULV also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to ULV students, the university is equally committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our website.
By continuing to use ULV Sites, you are accepting the terms of use defined in this statement.

When you access and use our Sites, some information is automatically collected. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and the website that referred you to us. We also collect information about usage and activity on our Sites and via third party web analytics services such as Google Analytics.
Cookies
When you visit our Sites, you may be issued a “cookie” which helps track your session while online. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive. Among other things, cookies help make your site visit more relevant and personalized for you. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Sites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent; however, it is possible that some parts of our Sites will not function properly if you do so.
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
Web Beacons
Sites and any communications sent by ULV may contain electronic images (generally, single pixel “.gif” images) called “web beacons.” These web beacons allow ULV and third parties authorized by ULV to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of a web page, email message, or other communication such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the device identifier of the device the web beacon is sent to, and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons may be used to count unique users, visits, and page views; monitor traffic and conversion patterns; personalize your experience when you visit the Sites, including advertising and content you see; and determine whether or not messages were opened, links were clicked, and/or notifications/offers were acted upon.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
