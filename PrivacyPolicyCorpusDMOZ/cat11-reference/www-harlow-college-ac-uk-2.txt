Use of cookies
We use "cookies" on some parts of our site to improve the quality of the service we offer, especially to enable users with visual impairment to alter the appearance of our site to meet their needs.
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small electronic files which a website can transfer to a user's hard drive to identify a user and personalise their use of that website. Our web server automatically collects standard information such as a user's IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, etc. We also use cookies to offer ways to customise your user experience should you wish such as accessibility tools like text size increasing and decreasing.
Google Analytics Cookies
Harlow College uses Google Analytics software which places cookies on a user's device to provide us with aggregated usage data of the Harlow College website.
Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions. The cookies are used to store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor. Browsers do not share first-party cookies across domains.
Analytical cookies allow us to count the number of visitors to our website, and to see how users move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the quality of the delivery of our web materials. No personal information is collected or retained by means of the cookies used to generate this statistical information.
Information on the cookies used by the default configuration and use of Google Analytics is available here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies
How to Control How Others use Cookies on your Computer
The cookies for Google Analytics are created automatically unless the user’s browser is set to refuse them. Users can set their browsers to accept or reject all, or certain, cookies. All recent versions of popular browsers give users a level of control over cookies. Further detail on how to control how webservers use cookies on your computer (including Google Analytics cookies) is available on the www.aboutcookies.org website, which contains a guide to deleting and controlling cookies.
Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
As a user you can prevent Google Analytics collecting traffic log data. To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected Google Analytics has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics.
If you want to opt out, download and install the add-on for your current web browser, it is available from http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and enables a user to opt out. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on is available for Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Opera.
