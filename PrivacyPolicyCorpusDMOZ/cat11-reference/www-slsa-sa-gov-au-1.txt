Use of your personal information
Your personal information is used and retained for the purposes of the services you subscribed to.
No attempt will be made to permanently record the materials or services used. Our library management system will record materials used while they are in use for security purposes, but does not keep a record of the user after the material is returned.
Storing your personal information
Keeping your personal information secure is important to us. We keep your data securely stored on our web-server ensuring it is not misused, lost or altered without your permission. Our staff who undertake services for you or engage with you are committed to keeping your information confidential.

The State Library does not disclose personal information for any purpose other than what the personal information was gathered for. Exceptions to this disclosure statement are listed in the IPPS, which we adhere to and comply with.
Third-party applications
The State Library provides some services and customer engagement via third-party products such as event bookings, online surveys and social media.
The personal information collected for these services and engagement is strictly used for the provision of the service or engagement. No personal information is gathered or stored elsewhere without the prior agreement of the user.
