Privacy
Respecting privacy is an important part of the CSCA’s commitment to our members and to the general public.  For clarity and transparency, we provide this notice to explain our information practices within the context of the overarching provisions set by Ryerson and its privacy policy and information protection procedures.
The Information We Collect and Why
The personal information that the CSCA collects includes:  name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and other relevant contact details and may also include information about your interests in and use of our research, data and services.
Our research model relies upon member support to help fund our research activities and the information that you provide helps focus our research efforts to better serve the needs of our stakeholders and administratively transact your requests.
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website, such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
This statistical data helps us continue to make our site more useful to visitors.
