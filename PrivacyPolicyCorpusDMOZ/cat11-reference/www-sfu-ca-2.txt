Mapping University Policies to University Classification Plan: A Crosswalk Index
Mapping University Policies to University File Classification Plan : A Crosswalk Index Introduction
This index is comprised of 14 broad, function-based classification categories, representing the major business functions of the University (e.g. Advancement, Finances, Governance).
Each of these functions is futher broken down by narrower, more specific classification categories (e.g. Advancement > Donors, Fundraising) under which are listed the relevant University policies.
The functions and subjects used in this index map to the classification categories of the University's Model File Classification Plan.
Policies are mapped to the University file classification plan using the first, the "Purpose" and "Policy" statements contained in each policy, and second, the executive office with primary responsibility for the policy.
Policy numbers printed in red are indexed under more than one function and/or subject.
