If any of the Personal Data you have provided to us changes, (e.g., your email address) or if you become aware of any inaccurate Personal Data about you, please let us know by sending an email to privacy@Babson.edu. or contacting the Office of Information Security, at Babson College, Office of Information Security, 231 Forest St., Babson Park, MA 02457. We will not be responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us.
There are some instances where we may not remove or revise Personal Data. For example, we may decline to remove or revise the following types of information, including, but not limited to:

SECURITY
To perform the functions listed above, we use risk-assessed administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction. Where feasible, systems that solicit or display personally-identifiable information are protected by authentication and authorization controls and Web-based experiences involving Personal Data are generally secured by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer protocol) with 128-bit encryption. We use firewalls and regular monitoring to evaluate any attempts at accessing our systems without permission. However, no transmission over the internet nor method of storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
RETENTION
We consider our relationship with our learning community to be lifelong. This means we will keep your Personal Data until such time as you tell us we no longer wish to keep in touch or pursuant to our retention schedules which authorize retention for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longest.
If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.
To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Data.
PUBLICLY POSTED INFORMATION
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you elect to post to any public areas of the Sites, Portals or Apps. This includes, but is not limited to, comments to Babson College blogs or fora. Comments posted to public areas may be viewed, accessed and used by third parties subject to privacy practices and policies of those third parties.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (“Third Party Sites”), including social media websites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies, data practices or content of Third Party Sites. By providing these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed Third Party Sites. Read the privacy policies of Third Party Sites to understand their privacy practices and policies.
FORWARDING EMAIL: PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS

CHANGES
The Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted to this page. Please regularly review the Privacy Statement for any changes. Where and as required by law, we will notify you if we make any significant changes.
DO NOT TRACK
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our Services do not alter behavior or change services if any of them receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.
COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We and our third party service providers and vendors use certain technologies to collect information about your use of our Services to operate the Services, conduct analytics, improve your user experience and for advertising purposes.

If you block all cookies, you may not be able to access Services.  Cookies are text files placed on your device when you visit our Sites that help us understand how you use our Site and save your preference for future visits. We also compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can offer betters Site experiences in the future.

(These are sometimes called “persistent” cookies).
We use the following cookies:
Session/Strictly necessary cookies – These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close the browser.       They are used to operate the Services and provide users with the Services available through our Services, including log-in and access to secure areas. These cookies are essential for using and navigating the Site and without them basic functions of our Site would not work.

Analytical/customization cookies – Third party cookies used to better understand the behavior of the users on our Services and improve our Services accordingly, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. Google Analytics – A web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). The information collected by Google (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.       How long a Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer or device depends on what it is and what it is used for. Some Google Analytics cookies expire at the end of your browser session, while others can remain for up to two years. You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our Site by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your current web browser.
Advertising – We sometimes use cookies from third parties that enable such parties to serve ads to you based on your use of the Services. These interest-based advertisements are also known as “online behavioral advertising.” Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Data with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript “tags” and other technologies such as web beacons or pixels being used on our Site. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL’s), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information.
Local shared objects (“Flash” cookies) are associated with non-browser software like Flash Player. Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others, but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls. Please visit adobe.com to learn how to delete and block Flash cookies.
HTML5 local storage enables browsers to distinguish your device from others and remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website. Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. Please check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage.
E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance. E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others. Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.
Our mobile applications may use the following technologies for features, services, advertising, or analytics:
Collection of device identifiers, such as Android ID, MAC address, or UDID
Collection of geolocation, including precise geolocation
Sharing Cookies and Technical Information with Third Parties
We have relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through a Portal or Site. We may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service to enable you to access third-party services without re-entering your Babson user ID and password, or other required information, each time.
Cookies may be set by parties other than the College. These “third party cookies” may, for example, originate from websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter or other social media services for which the College has implemented “plug-ins.” Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy pages of those sites directly.
Your Privacy And Choices

Please see the links on the following popular browsers for guidance on how to modify your web browser’s settings:
Internet Explorer
Mozilla Firefox

If you reject, turn off or block cookies, as stated above some parts of our Sites, Portals and Apps may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in “Flash” cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.
You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser options (some are mentioned above) or you can opt out of the collection and use of this information through tools like the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-out page. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser. If you are located in the EU, visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s Your Online Choices opt-out tool here.
As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software.
Digital Marketing and Ad Networks
Third Parties may collect Personal Data from other sources. Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.
