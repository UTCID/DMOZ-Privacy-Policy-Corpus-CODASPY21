Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Ohio Wesleyan University (“OWU”) Web site (http://www.owu.edu/) and its associated sites (under the owu.edu domain):
Information Gathering
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the OWU network. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous.
We occasionally monitor search terms that users enter into the OWU Search Engine, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.
The Future OWU Students site uses voluntary information request forms and interview, tour, and event registration forms to coordinate OWU’s student recruitment efforts. The Office of Admission collects visitors’ personal and demographic information (like name, citizenship, and mailing address). This information is used to send admission and financial aid materials about OWU to prospective students and their friends and families, to track potential interest in OWU as an educational institution, and to assist in the overall college matriculation process.
The OWU Alumni and Friends site uses voluntary alumni record update forms to coordinate OWU’s alumni relations efforts. The Office of Alumni Records collects visitors’ personal and demographic information (like name, race/ethnicity, occupation, and mailing address) and unique identifiers (like social security number). The information is used to send materials about OWU to alumni and benefactors, and to facilitate alumni recordkeeping and fundraising programs.
Use of Information
OWU uses the information gathered above to tailor site content to user needs, and to generate aggregate statistical reports. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis and then deleted completely from our systems.
Any personal and demographic information voluntarily disclosed to OWU via these Web sites becomes the property of OWU. Under no circumstances will OWU share this information with any third parties for the dissemination of unsolicited advertising or promotional material of any kind, or for any other purpose not expressly listed above.
Security
This Web site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
Disclaimer
The OWU Web site contains links to other independently run Web sites within the OWU network and to some sites outside the owu.edu domain. OWU is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
Contacting Web Services
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please contact:
