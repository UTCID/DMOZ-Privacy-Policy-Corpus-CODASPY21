Cookie Policy
Our website, along with most other websites, uses cookies and similar technologies.
What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files containing pieces of information that websites can store on your computer’s hard disk. Cookies enable users to navigate around the website and allow us to continually improve the website and make it more efficient to use on future visits.
We use two types of cookies on this website:
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your machine only for as long as you are on the website and are deleted after each visit.
Persistent cookies remain on your machine until expiry or deletion. Persistent cookies may store your personal preferences. They may also be used to record activity you may have previously completed, such as selecting preference filters, so that you are not asked to change your setting on each visit.
How we use cookies
Some of the cookies we use within our online services are ‘strictly necessary’. These are limited to those deemed essential to provide you with the services you have requested.
In addition we use cookies to:
Compile statistical reports on website activity, e.g. number of visitors and the pages they visit. Leeds Arts University uses Google Analytics to collect, review and utilise data collected from this website. Further information on how Google collects and processes data can be found at policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. We also sometimes use user journey tracking cookies such as Lucky Orange or Inspectlet to evaluate user journeys and improve the user experience.
Temporarily store any information which you may enter in tools, such as web forms.
In some cases, remember information about you when you visit our site. We may need to do this to provide some of our services.
We sometimes use third parties to assist us in the analysis of visits to and performance of our website, but no information that isn’t freely available online is collected. We do not use cookies to store any personal information that others could read and understand.
Advertising - some cookies are also used to track users’ interests and then provide targeted advertising on other websites via the Google Display Network or within Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, for example. The cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the site, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they visited. This data is anonymous and the University cannot see your name, phone number, email address or any other personal information which could identify you. We only gather personal data if you complete a form on our website to book an open day or order a prospectus.
Changing your cookie settings
You can block any cookies from any website through your browser settings. For more specific information about how to do this and how to manage cookies to suit your preferences, including deleting those that have already been added to your computer, please visit www.aboutcookies.org.
Please note that some parts of our website will not function properly if you reject cookies. If you share the use of a computer, accepting or rejecting the use of cookies will affect all users of that computer.
Consent to cookies
When you visit our website you will notice a banner informing you that we use cookies on our website and a link to this policy. If you continue to use this site without disabling cookies we will take that as your consent for us to place cookies on your computer. Please remember if you do disable cookies then some parts of our website may not work properly.
