The state and federal government requires that all hospital patients in New York State be given certain information and materials when they are admitted to a hospital. The information in the Upstate Patient Handbook is our commitment to informing you of required information and your rights as a patient in New York State.
The second section of the handbook, titled "Your Rights as a Hospital Patient in New York State," is divided into two parts. The first part provides an explanation of your rights and contains a glossary to help you understand some terms you may encounter while you are in the hospital. The second part presents a replica of each document that New York Statelaw requires you receive as a patient.
The New York State Patient Bill of Rights explains your rights as a patient:
