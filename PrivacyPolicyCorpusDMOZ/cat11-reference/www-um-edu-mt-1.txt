The University of Malta may also collect personal information supplied through the use of web-based forms and surveys.

In submitting your personal information online, you are agreeing that University staff may use your details for the sole purpose of conducting the business of the University.
Cookies
Cookies are small pieces of information that a website can put on your hard drive in order for it to remember something about you at a later time. The information is in the form of a text file, which will only be understood by the web site that initially set the cookie.
The University web site uses cookies for certain applications, e.g. to remember your name when filling in online forms. A cookie is also used to anonymously track how visitors interact with the University website, including where they came from and what they did. This is then used to ultimately provide a better online experience for all our audiences. You can stop your browser exchanging cookies with web servers at any time by changing the settings in your web browser.

If you contact the University of Malta by email, we keep a record of that correspondence for the purpose of conducting University business. We do not add any email addresses of those who communicate with the University through email to any mailing databases, nor do we pass this to any third party.

The University of Malta may collect contact numbers through the use of web-based forms and surveys. In submitting your contact number/s online, you are agreeing that University staff may use your details solely for conducting the business of the University, and specifically for the purpose referred to on the web-based form or survey where the contact number/s are submitted.
The contact numbers will not be supplied to any third party, save in the circumstances where the University uses a service provider in order to supply the University alert service, in which event such third party shall be duly bound to keep such numbers confidential and use them only for the purpose of providing such service.
While the University alerts/messages that are sent to your contact number may also contain sponsored advertisements, the main content of such alerts/messages shall consist of University-related matters.
