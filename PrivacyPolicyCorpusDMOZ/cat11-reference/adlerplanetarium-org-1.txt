Adler Planetarium Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we are making it available in the footer of every page of our website.
Information Collected
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Adler Planetarium website. It also applies to information collected or submitted on the Adler Planetarium’s WuFoo account. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials, such as our electronic newsletter. The types of personal information collected at these pages can include:

Address
Email Address

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected include:

Use of Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or asking a question only to complete that order or answer that question. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to receive our electronic newsletter. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you are asked as part of collecting your information.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with partners. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Google AdWords Remarketing

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Adler Planetarium’s website.
