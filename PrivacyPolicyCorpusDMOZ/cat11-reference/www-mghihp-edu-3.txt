Sustainability Policies
Three new policies were approved at the Executive Council December 2014 meeting which affirm the Institute’s commitment to provide students, faculty, and staff access to a comfortable work and learning environment; purchase energy efficient resources; and use recycled paper whenever possible.
Temperature Management Policy
The Temperature Management Policy seeks to maintain an average seasonally adjusted room temperature of 72 degrees throughout the campus providing students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable learning and work environment. This approach conserves valuable energy resources and reduces our carbon footprint.  The Institute Community is encouraged to wear clothing layers in support of this goal.
Energy Star Procurement Policy
The Energy Star Procurement Policy ensures the purchasing and leasing of ENERGY STAR© resources when such products exist and whenever financially and operationally feasible.
Recycled Brand Copy Paper Policy
The Recycled Brand Copy Paper Policy commits the Institute to purchase recycled brand paper. Based on current enrollment and usage the environmental savings realized during manufacture includes saving 43 trees compared to using regular copy paper and 3,103 fewer pounds of CO2, the equivalent to the output of one car per year.
These policies demonstrate the Institute’s commitment to environmental stewardship. Energy reduction resulting from these measures helps curtail global, social, and environmental impacts including the country's dependency on foreign oil and reduces the production of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
