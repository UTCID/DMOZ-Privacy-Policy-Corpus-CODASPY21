Annual Review of Title IX Adjudication ProceduresAs part of the UO Title IX Coordinator’s commitment to transparency and stakeholder involvement, a UO advisory group has begun meeting as part of the annual review of how the university adjudicates cases of sexual misconduct and prohibited discrimination and harassment. The advisory group will review the adjudication procedures in depth, with the goal of providing concrete recommendations for any changes to the process by the end of summer.For more information, visit the advisory group page.University policies related to prohibited discrimination and harassment, including gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment and sexual violence, may be found below or on the university policy library website.When resolving a complaint of discrimination or harassment, the university seeks a compassionate, fair, and equitable process. Members of the UO community are encouraged to contact the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance for more information regarding each policy and its corresponding procedures.Discrimination Complaint and Response (V.11.02)This policy outlines the university’s discrimination statement, response to discrimination complaints, responsible employee obligations, and defines prohibited discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and sexual harassment.Student Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Violence Complaint and ResponseA new policy to improve the university’s response to gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence experienced by students went into effect September 15, 2017.The new policy ensures clarity and transparency as well as compliance with Title IX. It clearly identifies employees by their reporting responsibilities:Establishing a named group of Designated Reporters allows students to make informed choices about whether to disclose information to employees who are required to report any and all disclosures of prohibited discrimination or harassment to the university.Identifying Confidential Employees with precision allows students to know who is able to keep disclosures confidential.Designating all other employees as Student-directed Employees, with specific response obligations that include providing support and resources, maximizes students’ access to supportive university personnel and affords students another avenue by which they can initiate a report to the Title IX coordinator if they so choose.Please Note: The previous policy still remains effective after September 15, 2017, as to all other forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based on any other protected status. It still designates all university employees, except confidential or otherwise exempted, as responsible employees. A responsible employee must still report all information related to instances of non gender or sex-based discrimination and harassment.Conflicts of Interest and Abuses of Power: Sexual, Physically Intimate, or Romantic Relationships with StudentsThis policy addresses sexual, physically intimate, or romantic relationships between employees and students, where the employee has power or authority over the student. This policy is meant to foster a learning environment characterized by professional behavior and fair and impartial treatment.Protection of MinorsThis policy intends to outline responsibilities related to the protection of minors at the university. Employees are mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect by law.Religious ObservancesThe university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for students who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or observance reasons, as outlined by the university discrimination policy (Section GG).
