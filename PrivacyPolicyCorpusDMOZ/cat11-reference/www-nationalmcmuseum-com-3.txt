In the event that a National Motorcycle Museum product is mistakenly listed at an incorrect price, National Motorcycle Museum reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. National Motorcycle Museum reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, National Motorcycle Museum shall issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.

These terms and conditions are applicable to you upon your accessing the site and/or completing the registration or shopping process.

Third-Party Links
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, National Motorcycle Museum may link to sites operated by third parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with National Motorcycle Museum, National Motorcycle Museum has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of National Motorcycle Museum. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, National Motorcycle Museum seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
