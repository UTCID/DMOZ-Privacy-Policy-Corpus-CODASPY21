Alumni privacy
Alumni information is collected under the authority of the University Act and in compliance with the British Columbia Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) for the purposes of administering alumni relations and fund development programs for Simon Fraser University and the Alumni Association.
How your information may be used
Your information is needed to register you as a member of Convocation and the SFU Alumni Association. We may use your information to inform you about the benefits of university and alumni association career, educational, volunteer, networking, award and social programs; to provide you with information about alumni benefits and services; to facilitate alumni participation in research projects, surveys, fundraising and development activities; and to administer elections for university and alumni association governing bodies. The University may also disclose your contact information, under strict confidentiality agreements, to mail houses or other outside agencies solely for the provision of mailing or telephoning services on behalf of the University or the Alumni Association.
How your information is protected
Our compliance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) ensures that your information is protected with appropriate safeguards and security measures. We do not sell or otherwise publicly disclose alumni information, nor do we share alumni information with any of our corporate affinity partners. While we do communicate with you to market products and services provided by our affinity partners, at no time do these companies have direct access to your contact information until you provide it to them yourself.
