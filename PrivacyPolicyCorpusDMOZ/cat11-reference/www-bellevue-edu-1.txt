Privacy Policy
At Bellevue University, we take your personal privacy seriously. This policy describes the categories of information we gather
via this website, describes how such information may be shared with others, and identifies the categories of persons with whom
it may be shared.
General
This online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to Bellevue University’s Internet web site located at www.bellevue.edu,
including affiliated web sites owned by Bellevue University which contain authorized links to this policy (collectively, the
“Site” or “Bellevue University Site”). The Site is governed by this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time, and not the
privacy policy in effect at the time any data or information was collected. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
collected at any site that is not owned by Bellevue University, including any web site reached through a link on any Bellevue
University Site. Please regularly review our Privacy Policy. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should
immediately discontinue use of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline
activities or websites other than the Site. Bellevue University employees, faculty members and students may be subject to
other Bellevue University policies and agreements related to this Privacy Policy or otherwise intended for the protection of
certain personal and confidential information (collectively, the “Bellevue Policies”). You expressly acknowledge that your
obligations and responsibilities under the Bellevue Policies, as applicable, are not superseded by this Privacy Policy and
that the Bellevue Policies shall be used together with this Privacy Policy to protect the personal and confidential information
of Bellevue University and its employees, faculty members and students to the fullest extent allowed by law.
The Site is intended for adult audiences, and Bellevue University does not knowingly collect any information that identifies
or any information that can be used to identify the individual to whom such information pertains (“Personal Information”)
from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. If you are under thirteen, please do not give us any Personal Information.
If you have reason to believe that a child has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us and we will attempt to
remove that information from our databases.
Changes in Privacy Policy
Any Personal Information that we collect and maintain via the Site will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from
time to time. Bellevue University may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. If as the result
of such changes you want to alter the ways in which Bellevue University is allowed to use your Personal Information, you can
do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled “Updating Your Personal Information Preferences.” You will
be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to this Privacy Policy after such changes have been
posted.
FERPA
Bellevue University is obligated to comply with certain educational records standards pursuant to the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). To the extent applicable, FERPA, as well as Bellevue University’s FERPA compliance policy,
govern the collection and use of information through the Bellevue University Site. Please note that FERPA is applicable to
information you provide only if you are or become a student of Bellevue University and permits the use, sharing and disclosure
of "Directory Information." For purposes of FERPA and this Privacy Policy, "Directory information" means your name, major
field of study, participation in recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, dates of
attendance, degree and awards received and most recent previous school attended. If you do not want such information about
you to be disclosed, please contact the Student Records at 1.402.557.7386 or 1.800.756.7920 extension 7386 or by e-mail at Regaddr@bellevue.edu.
You may opt out of disclosure of this information only if you are now or become a student of Bellevue University. Current students at Bellevue
University should refer to the Bellevue University Student Handbook or contact the Student Records, the Director of Student Financial Services
or Enrollment Management to obtain additional information regarding Bellevue University’s compliance with FERPA.
Collection of Personal Information
As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, when you use
the Site, Bellevue University may collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use
of the Site. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or
exit webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the
Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. Bellevue University may use such information to measure traffic patterns on
the Site and to improve user and student experiences with the Site.
Except as provided below, we do not match such information
with Personal Information held about you by Bellevue University unless we have your consent.
In order to reduce errors in our
database, prevent fraud and prevent abuse of our Site, as well as to provide more consistent, relevant experiences to our users
and students, we may on occasion supplement or correct the Personal Information you submit to us and your IP address with
information in our other databases.
Any Personal Information collected by Bellevue University via this Site is collected only upon your voluntary submission of
the same. We collect Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us through the Site when you sign up to receive more
information about our programs or otherwise contact us through the forms available on the Site. We also collect information
during the application and matriculation process, and, if you are enrolled as a student, when providing education to you or
when you use pages of the Site made available to you while you are a student. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
collected through means other than the Bellevue University Site.
Updating Your Personal Information Preferences
You have the right to access, correct and delete inaccuracies in your Personal Information, or request a change in the way
Bellevue University uses your Personal Information, at any time. You may access and correct your Personal Information or
request such changes by contacting us at Student Records at 1.402.557.7386 or 1.800.756.7920 extension 7386 or by e-mail at
