Student Complaint Policy & Resolution Center
Consistent with its mission, University of Detroit Mercy welcomes feedback from students about our policies, programs and services in an effort to promote a successful learning environment. To that end, Detroit Mercy is committed to providing prompt and fair resolution of all student complaints. We are accountable to our students, constituents and accrediting agency to provide a process by which students may lodge complaints in a nonthreatening manner, free from retaliation of any kind whatsoever.
What is a student complaint?
A student complaint ranges from an experience with, or treatment by, a University employee to a matter relating to academic or non-academic areas not addressed in college and school handbooks or University policies and procedures. There are two types of complaints:
Academic: College/School-related, Library/IDS, Center for Career and Professional Development, Student Success Center issues or any other academic matter.
Non-academic: Student Services (issues with Admissions, Financial Aid, Registrar, Student Accounting, International Services, Residence Life or other non-academic departments), Auxiliary Services (bookstores, food services) or issues with Facilities or Public Safety (buildings, parking lots, security of person or property, etc.)
How is a student complaint different from a grievance or appeal?
This student complaint site is not intended to address student academic grievance and appeal issues. Students interested in submitting an academic grievance or appeal should follow the procedures in the applicable catalog or student handbook for such issues. This site is also not intended for sexual harassment, Title IX, sexual misconduct or violence or any other type of discrimination claims. For issues in these areas, refer to the following resources.
Key documents and sites for specific complaints
Accredited Program Related Complaints: For complaints related to professional programs, contact the specific accrediting agency. Programs and specific accrediting agency information can be found in our External Entity Accreditation document (PDF).
Title IX: For information related to sexual or gender-based discrimination or harassment, visit Detroit Mercy's Title IX site, which includes:
Sexual and Gender-based Harassment Policy and Resolution Process
Title IX Complaint Form
Tuition Variance: This site is also not intended for issues that need to be submitted to the Tuition Variance Committee. Those issues need to go to the committee through the Student Accounting Office and require use of the Petition for Variance form.
Whistleblower Policy: To encourage good faith reports of allegations of misconduct concerning compliance with Detroit Mercy’s policies and procedures, please find our whistleblower policy listed on the HR Policies page.
Steps to file a student complaint
Informal complaint resolution
Students are encouraged to seek an informal resolution of the matter directly with the faculty or appropriate college/school administrator or specific individual(s) involved when possible. Detroit Mercy schools and colleges have policies and processes for specific categories of complaints.
Submit student complaint
For matters where an informal resolution is not feasible, submit your complaint to the University by using the online Student Complaint Form.
This site will help guide you through Detroit Mercy's procedures for submission of complaints.
Formal Complaint Resolution: Seek conflict resolution whenever possible by communicating directly with the University employee responsible for the service or area of complaint. In most cases, you will be asked to speak with the department or staff member associated with the concern.
If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the initial interaction or you are not comfortable approaching the Detroit Mercy employee directly, submit your complaint to Detroit Mercy using the online complaint form.
Students who are unable to submit an electronic form may have a University employee submit the form on their behalf.
When submitting a complaint, please provide as much information of the following information.
Describe your specific complaint and what occurred. Identify the names of all individuals involved.
Include date, time and location of the incident that resulted in a complaint.
Attach and documents to support the complaint.
What happens next?
Once you submit the complaint using the online form, you will receive an email confirmation of receipt within 7 business days.
If additional information is required, you may be notified.
Within thirty (30) business days of the submission of your complaint, Detroit Mercy will provide you with a response.
If more than thirty (30) days is needed to research and respond to your complaint, you will be notified.
Upon either responding to or addressing the complaint, the issue will be considered closed.
If a student wishes to appeal the response, the student has five (5) business days in which to do so in writing to the Provost. The written appeal must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the appeal. The Provost or the Provost’s designee shall have ten (10) business days in which to respond. The Provost’s determination shall be final.
Administrative reports and amendments
Student Complaints will be tracked and reported annually by the Office of Academic Affairs to assist business units affected in identifying areas of improvement and making recommendations, if necessary, to address the quality of the student experience.
Detroit Mercy has the right to modify, amend or terminate this policy at any time.
