Subscriptions
RUVENECO Inc. bills you (your "Billing Account") for use of any of
our products and services, including, but not limited to, your user
subscription (the "Service"), through PayPal (www.paypal.com).
PayPal may charge your debit or credit card or debit your bank account
if you have a PayPal account that allows for such debits from your bank
account.
You agree to pay RUVENECO Inc. all charges at the prices then in
effect for any use or mere access of the Service by you or other
permitted persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account,
and you authorize RUVENECO Inc. to charge your chosen payment provider
through PayPal (your "Payment Method") for the Service. You agree to
make payment using that selected Payment Method. RUVENECO Inc. reserves
the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has
already requested or received payment. RUVENECO Inc. may choose to
arrange an alternate payment method including Authorize.net, certified
cheque or money order.
Access to the Website's Features
Some features of our Website do not require you to be a registered user, including, but not limited to, the discussion boards.
Other resources on our Website are accessible for registered users
with and without charges. Free features available to registered users
may include, but are not limited to, one abbreviated Gold Standard MCAT practice test.
Other features of the Website may require that you become a paying member for access.
Automatic Renewal
Your subscription will be automatically extended for successive
renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally
selected.
If you cancel your subscription, access to your subscription will be
terminated within 48 hours. In no event will you be eligible for a
prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the
then-current subscription period.
For subscribers who cancel their subscriptions, your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.
Recurring Billing
Subscription plans for the Service consist of an initial period, for
which there is a one time charge, followed by recurring periodic
charges. Your subscription program is available when you log into the
Website using your unique user ID, which you obtain upon registration.
By subscribing to any of the RUVENECO Inc. Web sites, you acknowledge
that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and
you accept responsibility for the initial payment and all recurring
charges prior to cancellation, except as otherwise provided in this
Payments Policy. RUVENECO Inc. may submit periodic charges (including
your initiation fee and monthly charges), without further authorization
from you, until you provide prior notice (confirmed in writing upon
request by RUVENECO Inc.) that you have terminated this authorization or
wish to change your Payment Method, except as otherwise provided in
this Payments Policy. Such notice will not affect charges submitted
before RUVENECO Inc. could reasonably take action to respond to your
change or request.
PayPal has certain policies about recurring billing, giving you
additional rights, if you have a PayPal account. For PayPal account
holders, PayPal allows you to cancel recurring payments by logging into
your PayPal account and following the instructions that PayPal provides.
For more information on PayPal's policies concerning recurring
payments, please visit www.paypal.com.
Please note that if you are a PayPal account holder and you put your
recurring payments on hold or otherwise stop payments through PayPal,
your subscription will be deemed cancelled by RUVENECO Inc. See
Subscription Cancellation below.
Free Trials and Other Promotions
Any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level
access to the Service must be used within the specified time of the
trial.
Payment Information Required
We do not directly collect your payment information. We do not have
access directly to your payment information, including, but not limited
to, any credit card number or bank account numbers that you will provide
to PayPal, when you pay for the Service. In order to process your
payments, you will need to provide all information required by PayPal,
including, but not limited to, any credit card numbers. For more
information about PayPal, please visit www.paypal.com.
Payment Method
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and PayPal (www.paypal.com),
as well as the financial institution, credit card issuer or other
provider of your chosen Payment Method assessed through PayPal (the
"Payment Method Provider"). If RUVENECO Inc. does not receive payment
from PayPal through your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all
amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. PayPal may also have
certain rights if it does not receive payment from your Payment Method
Provider; please review PayPal's policies for more information (www.paypal.com).
Authorization
Except as explained in this Payments Policy, your non-termination or
continued use of the Service reaffirms that RUVENECO Inc. is authorized
to charge your Payment Method. RUVENECO Inc. may submit those charges
for payment, and you will be responsible for such charges. Neither
PayPal (www.paypal.com) nor RUVENECO
Inc. waives its rights to seek payment directly from you. Your charges
may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise
described when you subscribed to the Service or as may apply for
returning users after having put their accounts on hold.
Putting Your Account On Hold
Your subscription can be managed on the Website, including accessing Unsubscribe instructions, by going to "Account".
If you wish to Unsubscribe, you must notify PayPal of your status.
You are responsible for any fees incurred or otherwise due prior
Unsubscribing as stated in this Payments Policy.
If you are a PayPal account holder and put your recurring payments on
hold or otherwise stop payments through your PayPal account (www.paypal.com), we may treat your account as canceled rather than simply on hold. See Subscription Cancellation below for more information.
Please note that once you have put your account on hold, you will not
be able to access certain features of the Website that were available
to you as a paying subscriber. To reactivate your account, go to
"Account".
Please note that RUVENECO Inc. reserves the right to completely
deactivate any accounts that are put on hold for a period greater than
three months. If your account is deactivated because you have exceeded
the three month period, you may be required to resubscribe and pay the
initiation fee again at the then current subscription rate, along with
recurring billing at the then current subscription rate.
Subscription Cancellation
Your subscription can be managed on the Website, including directions for canceling your account, by going to "Account".
If you cancel your subscription, you must notify PayPal of your
cancellation. You are responsible for any fees incurred or otherwise due
prior to cancellation as stated in this Payments Policy.
If you are a PayPal account holder and put your recurring payments on
hold or otherwise stop payments through your PayPal account (www.paypal.com),
we may cancel your subscription and deactivate your account on our
Website so that you will no longer be able to access it through the
Website.
Refunds and Credits
There will be no refunds issued for any recurring billing period
after the first 30 days of your subscription have elapsed, including,
but not limited to, if you reactivate your account after it has been
placed on hold. If you cancel your subscription and then decide to
rejoin at a later time, you will have to pay the initiation fee again;
however, you may put your account on hold through the Website and simply
take it off hold to avoid paying the initiation fee again, if you
decide to voluntarily suspend your usage of the subscription, except
that there may be a time limit imposed for this type of on-hold status.
See Putting Your Account On Hold above for more information.
Any payments you make to us for any of our products and services
will be made through PayPal. PayPal has its own terms and conditions for
usage, which can be viewed by visiting www.paypal.com.
All purchases you make are final. If you cancel your subscription or
put it on hold, you may use your subscription until the end of your
then-current subscription term as set forth in this Payments Policy. You
will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the
subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period, whether
you put your account on hold or cancel it as explained in this Payments
Policy.
Refunds, if any, will be typically requested by RUVENECO Inc. from
PayPal within seven (7) to ten (10) business days of the notice of
cancellation. PayPal, based on its policies and the method of payment
you chose, will determine the actual amount of time required to issue
the refund and the manner in which the refund will be issued.
Surcharges, if any, charged by PayPal will not be refunded to you,
unless PayPal's policy so permits. Visit www.paypal.com for information
on PayPal's refund policies.
No refunds will be given if, for any reason, you violate the terms of service as outlined in the User Agreement.
