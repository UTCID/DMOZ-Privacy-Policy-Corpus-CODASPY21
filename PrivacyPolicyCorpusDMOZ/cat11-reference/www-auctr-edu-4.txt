On occasion, the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library sponsors exhibits that generate interest beyond its member institutions.  In such instances, library access policies may be adjusted by Library Administration in order to provide the external community an opportunity to enter and enjoy viewing such exhibits. Primary concern for Library access remains the safety and security of our users and the availability of resources to our Atlanta University Center (AUC) member users.  This policy is subject to interpretation and may change at the discretion of Library Administration.  Any policy exceptions must be approved by Library Administration.
All visitors entering the library must show a valid, government-issued photo identification (driver’s license, military ID or passport, for example). Students, faculty and staff of the AUC Woodruff Library's member institutions must show a current AUC identification card.  Individuals from an ARCHE member institution must show a current institutional identification from an ARCHE member institution.  Visitors will be required to sign in/out and leave their identification with Security Services.  At any time, bags are subject to search by Security Services staff.  Persons without appropriate identification will not be admitted.
Individuals seeking entry to exhibits sponsored by the AUC Woodruff Library may enter to view the exhibit during exhibit display hours.  Appropriate identification must be shown as outlined above in order to enter to view exhibits.  Individuals will be issued an exhibit pass upon entering the Library.  Persons age 17 and under must be accompanied by parent, guardian, or AUC sponsor.
Exhibit viewing hours may be different than building operation hours. Exhibit viewing hours are subject to change at the discretion of Library Administration.
Exhibit viewing hours:
Monday through Thursday:  9AM to 7PM
Friday: 9AM to 6PM
Saturday: 12 to 6PM
**Closed Sundays and holidays.  Note also that exhibit hours may be adjusted for academic exam periods, interim and summer sessions.**
Exhibits are unguided in nature. Groups of 10 or more must schedule their visit at least 10 working days in advance of the anticipated visit by contacting Library Administration at 404.978.2003.
