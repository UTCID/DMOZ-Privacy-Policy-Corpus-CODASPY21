Reporting Policy Violations
The Clark University Policy Library serves as the central repository
for University policies. This site
contains many, but not all, of the official policies of the
University. For purposes of the Clark
University Policy Library, a University Policy
typically:
has broad institutional application;
enhances the University's mission and provides
operational efficiencies;
mandates action or constraints and establishes
boundaries for conduct;
helps ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, and reduces institutional risk;
changes infrequently and sets a course for the
foreseeable future; and
requires approval at the highest administrative
levels of the University.
The Clark University Policy Library is divided into eight categories,
each of which holds related policies and procedures. Certain other official policies are also
published in the Faculty Handbook, the Student Handbook (Synergy), the Handbook
for Administrators and Staff, and the Academic Catalog.

relating to the University's mission of teaching and research

Facilities, Equipment and Property - policies and

Information Technology - policies and procedures
