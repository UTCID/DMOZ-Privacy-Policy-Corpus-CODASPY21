Privacy Is Power: 21st Century Survival Skills
24 September 2020
- 18:00
Hertford loves a lively conversation. In a new series, Principal Tom Fletcher will be asking members of the Hertford community and special guests about the survival skills they believe we need but are not always taught, beginning with the dynamics of power and privacy.
We start with Hertford’s newest Fellow, philosopher Dr Carissa Véliz. In the week she launches her brilliant new book, Privacy Is Power: Why And How You Should Take Back Control Of Your Data, Carissa will help us understand how to protect ourselves from the growing data harvesting industry. How can we escape the surveillance that is undermining our individual and collective freedom? As we look forward to a period when we will be spending even more time online, what practical steps can we take in our own lives to take back control of our data?
Join us for the live discussion at 18:00 on Thursday 24 September on Hertford’s YouTube channel. Tom and Carissa will be joined by HRH Zeid Ra’ad, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and a passionate advocate for freedom; and Hertford Fellow Prof. Mike Wooldridge, author of The Road to Conscious Machines: The Story of AI and Head of Oxford’s Department of Computer Science. Please do send any questions you would like Tom to ask Carissa to communications@hertford.ox.ac.uk. The interview will be available to watch later on YouTube and subsequently released in abridged form as a podcast.
Privacy Is Power is available to purchase from Blackwell’s, Amazon and other bookshops.
