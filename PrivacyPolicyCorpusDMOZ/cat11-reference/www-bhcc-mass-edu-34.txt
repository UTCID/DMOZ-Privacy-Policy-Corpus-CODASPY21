Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity
Bunker Hill Community College is an affirmative action/equal opportunity institution and does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, genetic information, maternity leave, and national origin in its education programs or employment pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151B, and 151C, Titles VI and VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964; Title IX, Education Amendments of 1972; Section 504, Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder, 34 C.F.R. Part 100 (Title VI), Part 106 (Title IX) and Part 104 (Section 504). All inquiries concerning the application of the above should be directed to Nahomi Carlisle, Chief Equity and Compliance Officer, Affirmative Action Officer and Section 504/ADA Coordinator, at 250 New Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown Campus, Room A307, Boston, MA 02129, phone: 617-228-3311; email nahomi.carlisle@bhcc.edu; for Title IX inquiries contact Carl Marcelin, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, phone: 617-228-2127; email carl.marcelin@bhcc.edu
When a student or employee believes s/he has been discriminated against based on race, creed, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, gender identity, genetic information, maternity leave, sexual orientation or disability status, the College’s Affirmative Action Plan provides an informal complaint process and a formal complaint process which may be accessed by any member of the College community. Whether a complaint/grievance is formal or informal, the College will conduct a prompt, thorough, fair and objective investigation, and will take such corrective action as is appropriate under the circumstances. No student or employee shall be retaliated against for filing a discrimination complaint/grievance or for cooperating with the College’s investigation thereof.
For more information or to file a complaint/grievance, contact Nahomi Carlisle, Chief Equity and Compliance Officer, Affirmative Action Officer and Section 504/ADA Coordinator, at 250 New Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown Campus, Room A307, Boston, MA 02129, phone: 617-228-3311; email nahomi.carlisle@bhcc.edu; for Title IX inquiries contact Carl Marcelin, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, phone: 617-228-2127; email carl.marcelin@bhcc.edu
Bathroom and Locker Room Use
All students may use bathroom or locker room facilities on campus that are designated as gender-neutral or that are consistent with a student’s sincerely held gender identity.
Use of a bathroom or locker room by any student for an improper purpose will result in disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.
Bulletin Board Posting Policy
Bulletin boards are placed throughout the College buildings. Boards should be checked frequently for event announcements, notices regarding academic matters, and information from the Student Government Association. College offices and committees appointed by the President of the College may post and remove materials that are directly related to their functional purpose on College bulletin boards.
Recognized student groups may request that up to 20 letter-sized copies (8 1/2” x 11”) and/or 20 poster-size copies (11” x 17”) of a printed item be posted for a period of two weeks or longer where appropriate in designated areas. Items posted for clubs must relate directly to on-campus information and events sponsored by the club or College.

Criminal Offender Record Information and Sex Offender Registry Information Checks
In order for a student to be eligible to participate in an academic, community, or clinical program that involves potential unsupervised contact with children, the disabled or the elderly, the student may be required to undergo a criminal background check, which could include a Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) check and/or a Sex Offender Registry Information (SORI) check. Students found to have certain criminal convictions or pending criminal actions will be presumed ineligible to participate in such activities. The College is authorized by the Commonwealth’s Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 6, Sections 167-178B, to access CORI records. Sex Offender checks shall be performed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 6, Sections 178C-178P.
For more information regarding the College’s CORI/SORI check process, please contact the College CORI/SORI representative at 617-228-2193.

Directory Information
Bunker Hill Community College considers directory information to be student name, academic program, semesters of attendance, current enrollment status, dean’s and merit lists, degrees or certificates awarded, and dates of graduation. The College may release directory information to a third party requesting such information without first obtaining the student’s consent.
You have the right to refuse to permit the College to release directory information. To do so, you must request that a privacy code be placed on your directory information and give it to the Registrar’s Office. If a privacy code is placed on your record, no directory information will be released in College publications or to third parties, excluding cases in which the Solomon Amendment or lawful subpoenas require the College to release such information by law.
Notwithstanding the College’s definition of directory information, the Department of Defense, pursuant to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, identifies the following additional student information as directory information for Department of Defense purposes: student’s address, age, and level of education. This information is available and accessible from student records. Directory information may be submitted without your consent to the Department of Defense in accordance with the Solomon Amendment.
Distribution of Printed Materials
For guidance on the distribution of materials on campus, please refer to the College’s Policy on Student Expression, which is applicable to students, employees and third-parties.
Educational Records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. Students are informed of their rights under this act through the College Catalog and below. They are:
The Right to Inspect and Review the student’s educational records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or another appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
The Right to Challenge Records and request the amendment of the student’s educational record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the College to amend a record by writing to the College official responsible for the record, clearly identifying the part of the record they want to be changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
The Right to Consent to Record Disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agency); a person serving on the Board of Trustees or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her task. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
The Right of Complaint.  Students may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Bunker Hill Community College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education600 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20202-4605
Food and Beverage Consumption
The consumption of food and beverages is prohibited in all classrooms, laboratories, auditoriums and lecture halls, with the following exceptions: Water in a capped bottle is permissible in all classrooms and labs. No other liquid is permitted. Other liquids in safe containers may be carried into classrooms where there is no equipment.
Guidelines Concerning Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment of a student, an employee, or any other person in the College is unlawful, unacceptable, impermissible, and intolerable.
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. It occurs in a variety of situations that share a common element: the inappropriate introduction of sexual activities or comments into the work or learning environment. Often, sexual harassment involves relationships of unequal power and contains elements of coercion, as when compliance with requests for sexual favors becomes a criterion for granting work, study or grading benefits. However, sexual harassment may also involve relationships among equals, as when repeated sexual advances or demeaning verbal behaviors have a harmful effect on a person’s ability to study or work in the academic setting.
For general purposes, sexual harassment may be described as unwelcome advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment or education; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting that individual or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s academic or professional performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or demeaning employment or educational environment.
A student, an employee, or any other person in the College who is found to have engaged in sexual harassment is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment or expulsion from the College.
When a student, an employee, or any other person in the College believes s/he has been the subject of sexual harassment, the complaint/grievance process is a mechanism for redress. Whether a complaint/grievance is formal or informal, the College will conduct a prompt, thorough, fair, and objective investigation, and will take such corrective action as is appropriate under the circumstances. Reasonable efforts are made to maintain confidentiality during the grievance process.
No student or employee shall be retaliated against for filing a discrimination complaint/grievance or for cooperating with the College’s investigation thereof. For more information, for a copy of the Affirmative Action Complaint/Grievance Procedure, or to file a complaint/grievance, contact Nahomi Carlisle, Chief Equity and Compliance Officer, Affirmative Action Officer and Section 504/ADA Coordinator, at 250 New Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown Campus, Room A307, Boston, MA 02129, phone: 617-228-3311; email nahomi.carlisle@bhcc.edu; for Title IX inquiries contact Carl Marcelin, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, phone: 617-228-2127; email carl.marcelin@bhcc.edu
Sexual harassment is forbidden by both federal and state regulations. In keeping with these regulations, a concerted effort will be made to protect employees, students, and others from sexual harassment as defined.
For the full text of the College’s policy concerning sexual harassment, refer to the Bunker Hill Community College Policy on Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity & Diversity.
Guidelines Concerning Sexual Violence
Committing an act of sexual violence upon a student, an employee, or any other person in the College constitutes a violation of state and federal laws and a major violation of the College’s Affirmative Action Policy. Sexual violence is absolutely intolerable and totally unacceptable.
Sexual violence is generally defined as any sexual activity for which consent is not obtained or able to be freely given and includes rape (vaginal, oral, or anal penetration without consent), acquaintance rape (rape committed by someone who is known by the victim), or any unwanted sexual activity that is forced or coerced by one person on another. It is a criminal offense to have sex with someone who is incapable of giving consent due to being intoxicated, unconscious, mentally incompetent, or under 16 years of age.
An employee or student who commits an act of sexual violence may be subject to criminal prosecution and will be subject to disciplinary action by the College, up to and including expulsion and/or termination of employment.
Victims of sexual violence are encouraged to contact the College’s Department of Public Safety at 617-228-2222 or 617-228-2053, or by reporting the matter at Room E-127 as soon as is practicable under the circumstances. If a victim is more comfortable reporting the alleged sexual violence to a College employee with whom s/he is better acquainted, such as a dean, administrator, or faculty member, s/he may do so. Any employee to whom an incident of sexual violence is reported, however, is required to notify the College’s Department of Public Safety and the Affirmative Action Officer and Title IX Coordinator forthwith. Nahomi Carlisle is the Chief Equity and Compliance Officer, Affirmative Action Officer, and Section 504/ADA Coordinator, at 250 New Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown Campus, Room A307, Boston, MA 02129, phone: 617-228-3311; email nahomi.carlisle@bhcc.edu. Carl Marcelin, is the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, phone: 617-228-2127; email carl.marcelin@bhcc.edu
If any student or employee believes that he or she has been the victim of sexual violence, the student or employee also has the right to file an Affirmative Action Discrimination Grievance with the College. For a copy of the Affirmative Action Grievance Procedure or assistance with filing a complaint, please contact Nahomi Carlisle, Chief Equity and Compliance Officer, Affirmative Action Officer and Section 504/ADA Coordinator, at 250 New Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown Campus, Room A307, Boston, MA 02129, phone: 617-228-3311; email nahomi.carlisle@bhcc.edu; for Title IX inquiries contact Carl Marcelin, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, phone: 617-228-2127; email carl.marcelin@bhcc.edu.
Reporting the incident to the College’s Department of Public Safety, the Affirmative Action Officer and Title IX Coordinator, or another College employee does not commit the victim to filing charges. Federal and state laws, however, require the College to investigate such reports. The matter will be investigated both by BHCC Police and separately by the Affirmative Action Officer and Title IX Coordinator. Although every reasonable effort will be made to protect a victim’s privacy, individuals with a need to know may be contacted and information may be shared as necessary to investigate and adjudicate the matter or as public safety requires. A report of the incident will be filed with local police in the event public safety is at risk even if the victim does not intend to report the incident to police or cooperate in an investigation.
The College prohibits retaliation against any person who presents a formal or informal complaint of sexual violence or who testifies or offers evidence connected with a complaint. Retaliation is a violation of the College’s Affirmative Action and Diversity Policy whether or not the underlying claim of sexual violence is confirmed. For the full text of the College’s policy concerning sexual violence, refer to the Bunker Hill Community College Policy on Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity & Diversity.
Hazing
In 1985, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed legislation that prohibits any form of hazing on campuses throughout the Commonwealth. Portions of that bill read as follows:
Whoever is a principle organizer or participant in the crime of hazing shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. The term “hazing” . . . shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation. Whoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing and is at the scene of such crime shall, to the extent that such person can do so without danger or peril to himself or others, report such crime to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as reasonably practical. Whoever fails to report such crime shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars.
Copies of the Hazing Act, Chapter 269, Sections 17–19, are available at the Student Activities Office, Room D106H.

All full-time students in a Degree or Certificate program (12 or more credits), and
All health science students – both full-time and part-time (note that health profession programs will require additional health records and requirements*) and
All students on a student or other visa – both full-time and part-time (including foreign exchange students and those students visiting or attending classes while on academic visitation or exchange program).

Students who fail to present the required information within 30 days of the date of registration may not be allowed to register for subsequent semesters until the immunization form is received by Student Central. Immunization forms become part of the student’s permanent file and cannot be copied, transferred or returned.
Medical Leave Policy
A Medical Withdrawal  is initiated by a student when the student's medical condition interferes with their ability to do coursework, manage day-to-day functions, or conduct themselves safely in the college environment. The purpose of a Medical Withdrawal is to support the student in taking time away from school to receive treatment, to focus their time and resources on improving their health, and eventually return to the College with a significantly improved chance of academic and personal success.
Tuition and fee refunds are not issued to students who are medically withdrawn from the College.  A student that receives financial aid will have their aid recalculated according to federal and state requirements.  More information on withdrawing can be found on the Financial Aid webpage.
Please carefully review BHCC’s policies for withdrawing from the College prior to completing and submitting the required documents. This procedure applies to all students registered for classes at the College.
Information on the medical re-entry process can be found on the Dean of Students webpage.
Policy on Fundraising and Solicitation
Solicitation and commercial activities are prohibited on College property without the College’s prior, written consent. Prohibited solicitation includes, but is not limited to, the posting of advertisements for the sale of goods or services on College property. Fundraising of a personal or political nature is strictly prohibited.
The College may permit fundraising activities by College-affiliated persons or groups, including recognized student groups and organizations, in direct support of their College related activities. All fundraising activities by College affiliated persons or groups, including fundraising materials, must be authorized by the appropriate College unit and be in compliance with the College’s fundraising guidelines. All fundraising materials shall bear the name of the person or group conducting the activity. Fundraising activities conducted in noncompliance with this policy are expressly not approved or endorsed by the College and are prohibited.
Policy on Guest Speakers
As part of the educational process, students are encouraged to invite guest speakers who have a demonstrated expertise in an area of interest to the College community. Recognized student clubs and organizations may invite to the College any person who contributes to the intellectual or cultural life of the College. Individual students wishing to invite a speaker to campus should seek the sponsorship of a recognized student club or organization.
It is recommended that prior to extending a final invitation the sponsoring club or organization consult with the Student Activities Office and the club faculty advisor to assist the College in its efforts to offer a full, varied, and balanced program of guest speakers that will result in the broadest exchange of ideas and opinions.
A guest speaker program may be subject to reasonable and content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions. Speech that seeks to incite imminent violence or constitutes harassment, threats, defamation or obscenities is prohibited. It shall not be inferred or implied that any guest speaker program conducted in accordance with this policy is approved or endorsed by the College.
To schedule College facilities for a guest speaker program, please contact the Student Activities Office at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance to ensure proper planning and the availability of security, facility equipment and/or personnel and/or food services, to the extent requested or required. College facilities will be assigned based on space availability.
Policy on Student Expression
The College recognizes and supports the rights of students to engage in constitutionally protected expressive activities on campus, including speaking, non-verbal expression, distributing literature, displaying signage and circulating petitions.  Expressive activities may be conducted at any publicly accessible outdoor area on campus, including the outdoor plaza in front of B-Building.  Expressive activities may also be conducted on the Charlestown Campus in the lobby area inside the main entrance to the College, the D-Building lounge and the lobby outside the Fitness Center. The Student Lounge may be used on the Chelsea Campus. Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as limiting expressive activities at any other publicly accessible location on College property so long as the expressive activity or related student conduct does not disrupt College activities or functions or violate any other applicable College policies. Disruptive activities, which are generally prohibited, may include obstructing building entrances or exits, walkways, sidewalks, vehicular or pedestrian traffic on or adjacent to campus, and/or interfering with the College’s academic mission, classes, meetings, events, ceremonies or with other essential processes of the College. The College reserves the right to impose reasonable and content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions on expressive activities as constitutionally appropriate and to prohibit any expressive activities that seek to incite imminent violence or constitute harassment, threats, defamation or obscenities. It shall not be inferred or implied that any expressive activity conducted in accordance with this policy is approved or endorsed by the College.
The College strongly encourages students who wish to engage in expressive activities in publicly accessible locations on campus to contact the Dean of Students Office at 617-228-2436 to schedule the desired location in advance to minimize possible conflicts. Priority for use of specific locations is given to students who register their activities with the College. Use of any non-publicly accessible locations on campus by any student must also be scheduled through the Dean of Students Office.
When distributing literature on campus, it is strongly recommended that all such literature bear the name of the individual, club or organization distributing the materials. The distribution of literature for the purpose of solicitation or commercial activity is strictly prohibited.

Publications Policy
Student publications at BHCC are needed and have educational value for editors, staff and the student body at large. They should be used as a tool to establish and maintain open and responsible discussion and intellectual exploration on campus. In the tradition of liberty of the press, students should be free, individually and collectively, to express their views on issues concerning institutional policy and other matters of general interest to the student body.
The institution must guarantee sufficient editorial freedom for the student publications to maintain their integrity as vehicles for free expression in an academic community. Student publications should be free of censorship and their editors and managers should be protected from arbitrary suspension and removal because of student, faculty, administration or public disapproval of editorial policy or content.
At the same time, since the entire academic community is represented in part by student publications, the editors of such publications must recognize their commitment to responsible journalism in the avoidance of libel, indecency and undocumented allegations or personal attacks and in fair representation of the student body and the College. Similarly, the editorial boards of these publications must reflect the diversity of the College. In an attempt to ensure this responsibility, all publication copy must be previewed by the advisor and the respective editorial board prior to publication.
Radios and Other Audio Devices
Personal MP3 players, iPods, radios and CD players may be played in campus buildings only with headphones or earphones. Other types of amplification are not allowed unless you obtain special permission from the Director of Student Leadership and Engagement.
Religious Services
Religious services may be conducted on occasion at the Bunker Hill Community College campus upon the request of a recognized student organization and/or group of employees (12 or more) of the College and with the authorization of the Dean of Students. The recognized student club, organization and/or group of employees should formally petition the Dean of Students for permission to hold the religious service on campus.
If the Dean of Students approves the legitimacy of the request, i.e., the student organization is one approved by the Student Government Association and the President of the College and the request involves an organized religious group recognized by the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, then the approved petition may be used to request space for the event through the Registrar’s Office.
Smoking
Bunker Hill Community College is dedicated to maintaining a healthy work and learning environment. The College prohibits smoking inside its buildings and facilities. The policy prohibits smoking in all outdoor areas within 100 feet from all doorways and athletic fields. This policy applies to all College visitors, students, faculty and staff. It is the responsibility of every member of the College community to comply with this policy.
Specifically, this policy is intended to eliminate the potential for exposure to secondhand smoke and to ensure all members of the College community can avoid the exposure to secondhand smoke. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a carcinogen. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes cancer, asthma, chronic respiratory illness and heart disease, and doubles your risk of heart attack. The College will provide information concerning smoking cessation programs through the Human Resources Office and the Health Services Office. A link is also available on the home page of the American Cancer Society.
All members of the College Community are encouraged to monitor and enforce this policy, for the health and wellness of everyone. Remember, it is the law.
Social Media Policy
Information technology resources provided by the College are the property of the College. Users shall have no expectation of privacy when using such resources. The use of all College information technology resources for social media activities, including but not limited to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, blogs and other forms of social media, shall be limited to academic, educational or professional purposes that are directly related to official College business and in support of the College’s mission. All such uses shall comply with the College’s computer use policies.
Statement on Civility
Bunker Hill Community College believes that civility in the workplace and classroom is everyone’s right and responsibility. This statement is consistent with the Student Handbook, all collective bargaining agreements and the College’s personnel policies. We understand “civility” to mean respectful language and behavior toward everyone at all times, regardless of the circumstances.
These qualities are intrinsic to excellence in teaching and learning, and contribute to the maintenance of a productive workplace and an overall positive campus climate.
Further, we affirm our commitment to behavior that is courteous and respectful in all interactions with members of the BHCC community as well as with members of the larger communities we serve.
Statement on Inclusion
The Bunker Hill Community College Board of Trustees endorsed and approved for adoption on June 9, 1997, the American Association of Community Colleges Statement on Inclusion as follows:
Bunker Hill Community College strongly endorses the continued use of admissions policies and employment practices that promote broad diversity in the community college system. The College will be free to pursue standards and policies that allow it to fulfill its diversity mission and vision. The students who are educated will help provide tomorrow’s leaders, and their college experience will demonstrate the richness and substance of our diverse, multicultural and global environment. The College environment will promote understanding and appreciation of others, while encouraging students to grow as individuals.
Bunker Hill Community College reaffirms its commitment to diversity. In accord with this philosophy, the College will evaluate its hiring, admissions and financial aid policies to ensure diversity and equal access within the institution. The College will ensure that the results of these evaluations conform to the concept of open access – the cornerstone of the College’s mission.
Bunker Hill Community College believes that diversity in education is crucial to a democratic society. Community colleges are, in effect, a microcosm of our greater society.
As such, Bunker Hill Community College will encourage and enhance the fullest understanding of human rights and responsibilities and will teach the skills that allow its students to effectively participate in a democratic society. The College will be responsible for shaping an environment that mirrors the general culture and creates opportunities for all within the college community to interact with understanding, tolerance and respect for others. In this way, diversity in education not only serves as a model for the world at large, but it also perpetuates social harmony for the future.
Student Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan
Chapter 23 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1988 requires that all students registered for nine or more credit hours must participate in a comprehensive health insurance plan unless they certify that they are participating in a health insurance plan with comparable coverage. If a student has comparable coverage and wishes to waive participation in the Massachusetts Community Colleges insurance plan, the student must submit waiver information via the internet by the due date that appears on the registration statement or at the time of registration. Students can access the waiver form online at gallagherstudent.com/bhcc. The College has set up dedicated computer stations in the Main Lobby of the Charlestown Campus for students without internet access.
MassHealth and enrollment in a subsidized health benefit plan through the Connector qualifies as comparable coverage. However, MassHealth Limited, the Health Safety Net and Children’s Medical Security plan do not qualify and cannot be used to waive coverage. Free care that is provided by hospitals and community health is not insurance and cannot be used to waive coverage. In addition, coverage from insurance carriers outside the United States and coverage by foreign national health service programs travel, and accident insurance plans cannot be used to waive coverage. Therefore, all international students must participate in the Student Health Insurance Program (SHIP) or obtain coverage from a U.S.-based carrier that meets state requirements.
All questions regarding SHIP should be directed to MAhealthconnector@state.ma.us or 1-877-623-6765.
All students carrying nine or more credit hours in the fall or nine or more credit hours in the spring must comply. Classes offered in the Center for Self-Directed Learning or during mini sessions are considered part of the long semester for purposes of determining health insurance requirements. Students are not required to have health insurance coverage during the summer term and students enrolled in web classes only are not required to purchase the College health insurance plan.
Health Insurance Refund Policy
Except for medical withdrawal due to covered injury or sickness, students withdrawing from the College during the first 30 days of the period for which coverage is purchased shall not be covered under the policy and a full refund of the premium will be made. Students withdrawing after 30 days will remain covered under the policy for which the premium was paid and no refund will be allowed. Students who do not withdraw completely, but who drop below nine credit hours within the first 30 days, may apply to Gallagher student Health and Special Risks for a refund of health insurance premiums. Registering for mini- sessions, web courses, and Center for Self-Directed Learning courses later in the fall or spring semester may restore the student’s obligation to carry health insurance.
Student Email Communications Policy
Policy Statement
Bunker Hill Community College has established electronic mail (email) as a means of sending official information to its students who are enrolled in credit courses. To this end, students enrolled in credit courses will be given an email account.
No one other than the student should be using the email account as this is assigned to the student for official communication.
Students should check their College email account regularly to ensure they are staying current with all official communications. Official communications include but are not limited to policy announcements, registration and billing information, schedule changes, emergency notifications and other critical and time-sensitive information. The Technology Support Services Lab in Room D111 is available for students to check their BHCC email accounts.
Responsibilities
College use of email—Email is a mechanism for official communication within Bunker Hill Community College. The College has the right to expect that such communication will be received and read in a timely manner. Official email communications are intended only to meet the academic and administrative needs of the College.
Assignment and provisioning of student email—Official College email accounts are available for all enrolled students. The addresses are all of the form [Name]@bhcc.edu. The account website (email.bhcc.edu) has been designed for this purpose. The student user ID and password for accessing email are the same as that for accessing BHCCselfservice.
Expectations for student use of email—Students are expected to check their email on a frequent and consistent basis. Students should recognize that some communications from the College may be time-sensitive. Some unacceptable excuses for missing College communications by email include: “I didn’t check my email” and “I had an error in forwarding email.”
Redirection of email—If students wish to have email redirected from their official @bhcc.edu address to another email address (e.g., @aol.com or @hotmail.com) they may do so, but at their own risk. The College will not be responsible for the management of email by outside vendors. Having email redirected does not absolve a student from the responsibilities associated with official communications sent to his or her @bhcc.edu account.
Authentication for confidential information—It is a violation of College policies for any email user to impersonate a faculty or staff member or another student. To mitigate risk, some confidential information may be made available only through BHCCselfservice, which is password-protected. When students receive email correspondence directing them to BHCCselfservice, they can access the confidential information only by supplying their user ID and a password. The confidential information will not be available in the body of the email message.
Privacy—Users should exercise extreme caution with email to communicate confidential or sensitive information, and should not assume that email is private and confidential. It is especially important that users are careful to send messages only to the intended recipient(s). Users should use caution when replying in email correspondence.
Student Online Security Policy
As a student at Bunker Hill Community College you will need to adhere to the Student Security Policy. This policy’s intent is to protect your Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the PII of other students, and the College’s computer and network resources. The policy is provided below.
