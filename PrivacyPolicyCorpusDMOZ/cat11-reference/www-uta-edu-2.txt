Records Management
THE PURPOSE OF RECORDS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (RIM)
The records management program assists university departments in the management of their records throughout the life cycle of those records. The life cycle stages of a record include creation, replication, distribution, processing, storing, retrieving, and final disposition.
THE TWO PRIMARY REASONS FOR MANAGING RECORDS
To comply with legal requirements applicable to state agencies and official university records, and to support UT Arlington policy in Records Management and Retention (HOP ADM 5-402).
To realize the benefits to the University as an organization that result from the application of records management practices. These benefits include:
Reduced legal liability
More efficient use of office space
More efficient use of employees' time
More complete and accurate information-gathering for management decisions
Quicker response to public information requests
HOW THE RIM PROGRAM AT UT ARLINGTON IS MAINTAINED
Each state agency is required to appoint a records management officer (RMO) who is responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the agency's records and information management program in accord with applicable laws, rules, and guidelines. UT Arlington's RMO is the University Attorney.
PROCEDURE 13-5, RECORDS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Records and Information Management (Procedure 13-5) describes the RIM program and provides instructions and resources for applying records management practices to university records.
