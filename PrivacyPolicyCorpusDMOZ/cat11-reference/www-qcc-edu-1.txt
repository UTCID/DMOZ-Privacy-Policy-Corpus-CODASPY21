I was in the middle of taking a test and got kicked out of Blackboard.Unfortunately, the information is probably lost permanently and you will need to recreate it. Contact your instructor immediately.Here are some reasons why you may have been kicked out:The internet connection dropped.The browser was refreshed.Your browser timed out due to inactivity. Blackboard has a security setting that logs you out if it doesn't receive any input for a period of time. Note: Typing into a text box doesn't count as activity. Saving periodically does count. Save frequently.These tips might help to prevent future issues:Use a wired connection if possible when taking a test. Wireless internet connections are less reliable.Do not refresh the browser page.Do not close the browser windowDo not click the browser's back button.If possible, type out the text in an external application like Notepad and then paste it into Blackboard Learn. Working offline first ensures that your work in progress will not be lost.If you are working in assignments, save your work in progress. Saving often helps avoid any browser timeout issues.

Remote Instruction What is remote instruction?When classes cannot be held face-to-face, the college president may direct faculty to use remote instructional methodologies in order to continue instruction. Remote instruction represents a temporary shift of instruction from meeting face to face to using technology tools such as email, discussion boards, video classes/conferences.Online Remote - This instruction is provided by your professor through a web-based learning management system and is not held in real time. Students interact with their faculty and classmates and participate in activities, and complete assignments working on their own time while meeting course due date requirements throughout the semester. It’s important to note that class meetings are not held in real time. Online remote courses are set up with assignments and activities that must be completed by certain due dates. Students will not see days or times when selecting courses.Real Time Remote - This instruction is provided through a live, virtual class experience for the hours assigned by the faculty. Students will access their class via the internet through a link that will be provided by the instructor. Faculty may reduce some virtual live instruction time to provide students an opportunity to work on class assignments during course time. Students will see all day and time remote meeting times when selecting courses, during which they must be available to participate.Hybrid - Hybrid classes provide some of the instruction in a remote modality via the internet and some instruction in person, on campus. These courses are for certain clinical, lab or practicum experiences. The number of on campus meetings will vary for each course. Students will see the days and times they need to come to campus when selecting courses, which they must be available to attend.
