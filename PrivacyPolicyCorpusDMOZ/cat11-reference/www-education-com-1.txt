Cookie Policy
At Education.com, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you.
In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies.
This cookie policy applies to any Education.com product or service that links to this policy or incorporates
it by reference. As explained in our Privacy Policy, at Education.com,
we are committed to only collecting, using and disclosure your personal data in ways that you expect and
have consented to or as we are required and permitted by law.
What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we put on your computer's hard drive.
These small files allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, monitor website
traffic and to personalise the content of the site for you. This ultimately helps us provide you
with a good experience when you browse our website and allows us to improve our site going forward.
You can decide to disable your cookies but please be aware that certain cookies are absolutely necessary
for the full functioning of our websites. For example, you cannot log in as we use a cookie to authenticate
your device. For more information on the different types of cookies we use please see detailed information below.
Please note however that Cookies cannot retrieve any personal data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses. Browsers prevent cookies from being sent to or read by websites other than the domain for which they
are meant.
What Types of Cookies Are There?
Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the website and use its features,
such as authenticating that you have logged in, or accessing member only areas of the website. Without
these cookies, services we provide like downloading worksheets or playing games, cannot be provided.
Performance Cookies
These cookies are used to determine how visitors use a website; for instance, which pages visitors go to
most often. Information these cookies help collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to
improve how a website works.
One of the analytics tools that our website uses is Google Analytics, to learn more about Google Analytics,
you can visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
Targeting/Advertising Cookies
These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website
operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other
organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site
functionality provided by the other organization.

What Are Persistent and Session Cookies?
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when you open the browser window to when you close it)
or they can be stored for longer.
Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions which allows your
preferences or actions to be remembered next time you visit our site.
Session cookies are temporary and allow our site to link your actions during a browser session.
They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering that you are talking to a live chat agent so you
can continue your conversation as you browse around the site. These session cookies expire after a browser session.
What Are First and Third Party Cookies?
Whether a Cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie.
First party cookies, in basic terms, are cookies set by the website you have visited (the website displayed in the URL window).
Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. I
f you visit a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website then this would be a third party cookie.
