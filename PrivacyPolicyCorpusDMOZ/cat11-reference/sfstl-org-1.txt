Donation Privacy Policy
Revised – July 6, 2017
The Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its donors, students, volunteers, staff and website users. This policy identifies what personal information is collected by this website and the organization and how the information may be used.
The Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis does not sell, rent, share or otherwise provide personal information collected to anyone outside the organization unless otherwise requested by you, the donor. For example, your personal information may be used to respond to your requests or to process your donations. The Foundation maintains appropriate electronic and physical safeguards over its systems to prevent unauthorized access and/or use.
The Scholarship Foundation does not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it voluntarily and knowingly. You can visit the Foundation website without telling the organization who you are or revealing any personal information. The Foundation employs Google Analytics to collect nonspecific, non-personal information for the purpose of analyzing website traffic and improving content. Most browsers allow the user to deny or accept the cookie feature.
The Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis has contracted the services of Stripe to process credit card donations and to insure that all credit card information submitted through this site is safely and securely transmitted over the web. The Foundation does not record or store your credit card information when donations are submitted on-line.
This website includes links to external websites. These links are provided for additional information on related topics or for educational purposes only. These links do not fall under the control of the sfstl.org domain and sfstl.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. The Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis makes no representations or warranties with respect to any linked website. Your use of any linked website is solely at your own risk.
Email Privacy Policy
Revised July 6, 2017
The Scholarship Foundation utilizes automated systems for mass email communication to deliver emails to members of our mailing lists. If you have received a mailing through one of these systems, The Scholarship Foundation has identified you as “opting-in” to the mailing list. This means you—the holder of this email address—have: (a) voluntarily shared your address with the Foundation for the purpose of receiving information or (b) registered with the Foundation, made a donation, or otherwise have an existing relationship with The Scholarship Foundation or (c) explicitly granted permission to another organization to share your address with its business partners which include The Scholarship Foundation.
Together, The Scholarship Foundation and its automated email vendors use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. These email vendors will not share, sell, or rent any information about you without your expressed, written permission, unless compelled to do so by law. Every mass email communication contains a link at the bottom: “Review/Edit Your Account Information or Unsubscribe.” Click this link and follow instructions to unsubscribe or edit/review your account information.
The Scholarship Foundation reserves the right to amend its privacy policies at any time. Therefore, please review them periodically. Use of the website after changes to the policies will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
For additional information about this site, to ask questions about these privacy policies, or to review or correct personal information collected by The Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis, please contact the Foundation by phone, in person, or through our website.
