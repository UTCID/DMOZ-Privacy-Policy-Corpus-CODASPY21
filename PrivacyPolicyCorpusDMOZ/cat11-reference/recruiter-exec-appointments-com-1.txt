Please read this carefully because it sets out the terms of a legally binding agreement between you and the Financial Times Limited.
1. Introduction
These are the terms and conditions which govern the way in which advertisers, recruitment agencies and employers (“Advertisers”) may use the services offered on www.exec-appointments.com (together, the “Website”). By accessing and using the services available on the Website, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions. If you use the Website in the course of your business or work, you are also agreeing to these terms and conditions on behalf of that business. We only make these terms and conditions available in the English language.
If you do not agree with the terms and conditions (or are not authorised to do so on behalf of your business or work) you should not use the Website or the services available on the Website. If you have any questions please contact us at contactus@ft.com. We recommend that you print and save a copy of these terms and conditions for your records.
References in these terms and conditions to ”FT” (or ”we”, ”us” or ”our”) refer to the company operating the Website. See Section 8 below for details. References in these terms and conditions to “you” and “your” refer to you as an Advertiser.

Provided that we have obtained an appropriate licence (consent) from users to make available the Profiles to you, we grant to you a non-exclusive, worldwide licence to use the Profiles acquired by you solely for employment and recruitment related activities.
