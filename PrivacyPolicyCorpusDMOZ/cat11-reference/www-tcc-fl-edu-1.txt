A Message From the President
Faculty, staff, students and vendors,
This statement is to reiterate Tallahassee Community College’s commitment to not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, genetic information, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or age in programs or activities. TCC prohibits discrimination, including disability discrimination and disability-based harassment. Students, employees or third parties who believe they have been subjected to disability-based harassment should report the incident to the College. TCC will conduct a prompt and equitable investigation, and immediately and appropriately address any violation of the College’s policies.
Complaints of discrimination, sexual misconduct, or unlawful harassment involving applicants, faculty/staff, students, vendors or guests should be filed promptly via TCC’s on-line complaint form, or directly with the College’s Equity Officer/Title IX Coordinator at (850) 201-6074, or tolsonr@tcc.fl.edu, or mailed to:
Tallahassee Community College Attn: Renae Tolson, Equity Officer & Title IX Coordinator Room 239 Administration Building 444 Appleyard Drive Tallahassee, FL 32304-2895
In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the College has designated an ADA coordinator. The coordinator oversees and coordinates the College’s efforts to carry out its responsibilities pertaining to ADA and serves as the contact person for all ADA inquiries and information about policies, procedures and concerns. The ADA coordinator may be contacted through the Disability Support Services office at (850) 201-8430 or dss@tcc.fl.edu.
TCC prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports an incident of alleged harassment or other misconduct, or anyone who provides testimony, assists or participates in a proceeding, investigation or hearing relating to these allegations. TCC will take interim steps to protect the reporting party involved while the case is pending. Depending on the case and the reporting party’s wishes, these steps may include, but are not limited to, class changes, no contact orders between parties, and providing escorts while on campus.
TCC will take prompt and effective steps to end the disability-based harassment; eliminate the hostile environment; prevent its recurrence; and, as appropriate, remedy its effects. After completion of a prompt and equitable investigation, students and employees found to have engaged in acts of disability-based harassment will be disciplined.
