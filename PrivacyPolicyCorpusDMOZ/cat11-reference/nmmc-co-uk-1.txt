This includes material in public record repositories such as The National Archives (formerly the Public Record Office) and designated places of deposit for public records (such as archives). Items can include census returns, deposited plans, tithe maps and apportionments.There are no problems with using such material that is still in copyright as long as acknowledgements are made. If using personal documents which happen to be held by the The National Archives but not of Crown copyright e.g. personal letters between a sailor and his wife, personal diary entries of a naval officer, permission must be sought from The National Archives.Probate material post-1858 and pre-1858 material that was administered by ecclesiastical courts is also covered by Crown copyright, as are medical records created by the National Health Service and predecessor bodies up to 1990. For medical records created from 1990 onwards copyright rests with the individual bodies (such as Health Trusts).
