October 14, 2020

School districts have made swift and dramatic shifts to continue to educate and protect their students in the new school year. The change has not been easy, and it’s come with significant questions about how to properly protect student data privacy while leveraging new technologies to help facilitate remote and hybrid learning and conducting required health screenings. Join Trusted Learning Environment Seal recipients to hear how they’ve met the challenges, and learn some of the simple steps you can take to improve your privacy program and build trust in your community.
Moderator: Linnette Attai, CoSN Project Director, Protecting Student Data Privacy Initiative and Trusted Learning Environment (TLE) Seal Project
