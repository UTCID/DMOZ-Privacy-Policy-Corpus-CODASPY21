College Information Event registrations – Course Enquiries When registering for events or making course enquiries we will ask you to complete some basic information regarding your name, contact details, subject area(s) you are interested in studying and the level of study (full-time, undergraduate, apprenticeships or part-time).  You may also be asked about your current situation, including school/college currently attending and likely year of entry.  This data is collected to ensure we can provide you with the information that you may need to study with us, and improve the advice that we provide you with, as well as understand the geographic reach that we have as an educational provider.  At the time of requesting the information your consent to process this data will be sought. This data will be held for a maximum of three years, or until the expected year of entry to the College (as determined by the information submitted and your date of birth) has passed.

We will not collect any personal data from you we do not need in order to provide the best possible learning experience to you. The information you provide may also be used to inform college demographic, wellbeing, research and performance data – this is done on an anonymised basis to better inform future college strategy Phone calls To maintain customer service standards, and assist in staff training, we may record and monitor incoming telephone calls.
