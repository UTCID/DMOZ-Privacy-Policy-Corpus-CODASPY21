Library Services to Persons with Disabilities
The Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library's goal is to enable access to physical and electronic materials for all our users, including physical access to the building, materials and facilities.The Library is continually working to provide appropriate aids and services leading to effective communication for persons with disabilities so they can participate in the Library’s programs, services, and activities. We are always seeking ways to make information and communications accessible to all people, including those with disabilities.All Library staff can assist with scanning and retrieving books and other materials from the shelf. To make arrangements ahead of time, please contact circulation services by phone at 404-978-2097 or email at circ@auctr.edu.To ensure that we fully support access for all students, the Library works collaboratively with the offices of student support services at Clark Atlanta University, Interdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse College, and Spelman College.If you encounter accessibility barriers at the Library or on the website, contact Associate Library Director, Dr. Kimberley Bugg.
