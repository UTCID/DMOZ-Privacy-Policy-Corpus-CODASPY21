Engineering Computing Support provides computing assistance to faculty, staff and students of the Samueli School of Engineering.
UCI also has a separate, large central computing support organization called the UCI Office of Information Technology.  UCI uses a distributed computer support model, with many central services supported directly by OIT and additional support for school-specific needs provided by the Engineering Computing Support team. You can contact OIT support at oit@uci.edu, or call them at 949-824-2222. Campus-wide service outages are reported at https://status.oit.uci.edu
Most Engineering faculty operate their own research computers, often with assistance or consultation with Engineering Computer Support.
Information for Engineering Undergraduate and Graduate students about computing, labs and software is available at http://laptops.eng.uci.edu
For technical support, you can open a ticket with Engineering Computing Support by sending email to helpdesk@eng.uci.edu.
