Terms of Service
Terms of Service
The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Wiki Education Foundation (“Wiki Ed”) website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website, including, but not limited to, dashboard.wikiedu.org, ask.wikiedu.org, playlist.wiki, and wikiedu.org (taken together, the “Sites” or the “Services”). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Wiki Ed’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Wiki Ed (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these terms will apply to any upgrades.
1. Acceptance of this Agreement
Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Wiki Ed, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.
2. Eligibility
In order to use our Services you need to (1) be 18 or older, or be 13 or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreement, and (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Wiki Ed is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
3. Responsibility of Contributors
If you create a Dashboard course page, ask or answer a question on ask.wikiedu.org, create a Playlist on playlist.wiki, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (collectively, the “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the substance of, and any harm resulting from, the Content and/or your posting, sharing, or distributing of the Content, regardless of the form of the Content, which includes, but is not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Wiki Ed Sites, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms or the Wikimedia Foundation’s Terms of Use. By submitting Content to Wiki Ed, and in consideration of the rights granted to you under this Agreement, you grant Wiki Ed a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual (or in jurisdiction where this is not permitted, for a term equal to the duration of the Agreement plus twenty (20) years), irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, make available to the public (e.g., perform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute the Content on Wikipedia under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (“CC-By-SA”) License. Aside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the Content.
Wiki Ed may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit Content. In all cases, Wiki Ed reserves the right to remove or disable access to any Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, Content that, in Wiki Ed’s sole discretion, violates the Agreement. Wiki Ed may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party (although we’ll do our best to do so). Removal or disabling of access to Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific Content.
You are solely responsible for all Content that you create. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST WIKI ED RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD WIKI ED HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.
If you delete Content, Wiki Ed will use reasonable efforts to remove it from its Sites and Wikipedia, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of these representations or warranties, Wiki Ed has the right (though not the obligation) to, in its sole discretion to: (i) refuse or remove any Content that, in Wiki Ed’s reasonable opinion, violates any Wiki Ed policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable; or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Services to any individual or entity for any reason.

Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Wiki Ed or third-party trademarks.
14. Changes
We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on our blog before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, THE PARTIES WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
23. Forum
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties agree that the claim will be brought exclusively in a federal court located in San Francisco, California. The parties expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and waive any and all objections to venue or jurisdiction. However, the parties may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights and any claims regarding infringement or misappropriation of its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.

This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
