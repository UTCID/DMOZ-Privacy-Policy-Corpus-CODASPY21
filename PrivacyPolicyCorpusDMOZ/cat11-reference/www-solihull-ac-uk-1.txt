Safeguarding & Prevent
The College is committed to providing a safe environment for young people and vulnerable adults, identifying young people and vulnerable adults who are suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm and to taking appropriate action to ensure that such young people and vulnerable adults are kept safe, both at home and at the College.
The College is also committed to providing students with the necessary skills and knowledge to keep themselves and others safe. Education, like other key sectors, has a responsibility to promote values of openness and tolerance and to facilitate free debate which is characteristic of being a British citizen.
