Privacy statement
Commitment To Privacy
University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) University (University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)
or “University”) is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of any collected
confidential or highly sensitive personal information. This policy has been adopted
to address the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by the University.
This policy is subject to change over time, as the technologies utilized to provide
services via the Internet continue to develop and evolve. Despite changes in technology,
any alterations to this policy will not affect the University’s commitment to privacy.
General Statement
This policy applies to all information digitally collected by or submitted to University
of Louisiana Monroe (ULM). University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) receives information
via two primary methods:
Information collected automatically via websites
Information voluntarily provided by the user in order to receive information and/or
services (via web forms and email).
Information Collection
3.1 Automatic Collection
If a user has not taken specific steps to anonymize their personal web traffic (e.g.
apply mechanisms such as the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on that disable
the collection of data for analytical purposes), official University websites may
collect certain information automatically. This information includes, but is not limited
to:
User’s Internet protocol (IP) address
Internet service provider
Operating system
The time and date of the visit
Browser
The site from which the user visited
Cookie information (if applicable)
Any information collected automatically is not associated with any other information
held by University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) (i.e. not linked with information voluntarily
provided to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)) unless University of Louisiana Monroe
(ULM) is required to do so by law.
3.2 Voluntary Submission
In order to provide information and/or services, University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)
may request users to provide personal data, some of which may be personally identifiable
information. Information such as name, date of birth, email address, etc. can be collected
via voluntary submission of an email or web form to a University of Louisiana Monroe
(ULM) entity.
Information Use
Website information that is gathered automatically is utilized to improve the understanding
of how University-provided websites are being leveraged by the user community. For
example, some University websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses “cookies” (i.e. files used to track website
activity) to determine how users navigate University sites. Google uses this cookie
data for various purposes, including the evaluation of website use, reports on website
activity, and other services. Please visit the following pages for more information
on Google Analytics’ terms of use and Google’s privacy practices.
Any information submitted to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) voluntarily in order
to receive services and/or information will only be utilized to conduct official university
business. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) may disseminate voluntarily submitted
information to third parties and offices/departments within the University to the
extent necessary in order to provide the requested services and/or information. University
of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) may also disseminate such information if required by applicable
international, federal, state and/or local laws.
University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) will not disclose any information submitted voluntarily
for reasons other than mentioned above, without clear notice and the opportunity to
opt-out or otherwise prohibit such uses. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) will
never sell or trade voluntarily submitted information to other entities unless a prior
consent has been obtained and/or such information is being shared in response to a
subpoena, court order, or legal process.
There is no legal requirement for a user to provide any information to the University.
However, without certain information, University websites and services may not function
as intended and features may be inaccessible.
Use Of Cookies
Some University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) websites use cookies (beyond cookies utilized
by Google Analytics), which enable University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) to further
tailor its web services to the needs of the user community. Cookie data assists the
University in improving both web content and distribution. Users have the right to
refuse the use of cookies by implementing technical configurations in their web browsers;
however, functionalities of certain sites may be impacted if such configurations are
implemented.
External Links
Some University sites may contain links to external websites not owned by, or officially
affiliated with, University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) in any way. If a user decides
to navigate to external links, he/she will leave the University website and thus,
the University is not responsible for privacy practices or the content of such websites.
Navigating to external links is done at the user’s own risk and users should be aware
that University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)’s policies no longer apply. University of
Louisiana Monroe (ULM) recommends that users review the privacy policy and applicable
terms of all sites they visit.
Data Security
In addition to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, the University
strives to implement and maintain systems and policies to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of personal information provided by users. Despite these security measures,
the University does not represent or warrant that personal information will be protected
against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.  Any information transmitted
to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) by the user is done so at the user’s own risk.
Once the information is received by University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM), the University
will make every effort to ensure the security of data on University of Louisiana Monroe
(ULM)’s systems.
