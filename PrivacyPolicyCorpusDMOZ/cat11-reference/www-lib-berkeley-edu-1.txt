Using the Library during COVID-19
Many of our services are now being offered in new ways.

The information on that page supersedes all other information on the Library website at this time.
Library Privacy Policy
Content section:
It is the policy of University of California, Berkeley Libraries that the privacy of all users will be respected in compliance with federal and state laws as well as professional standards.
The Library will not reveal personally identifiable information of individual users or reveal what information sources or services they consult under most circumstances. Reasons for disclosure include being required by search warrant or subpoena or if there is a substantiated reason to believe that violations of law or of University, campus, or Library policies have taken place; or when failure to act might result in significant bodily harm or significant property loss. This policy applies to all resources regardless of their format or means of delivery as well as to all services offered by the Library.
All library records and other information relating to an individual's use of the library and its resources are considered confidential. These records include, but are not limited to, circulation records of library materials, address and other registration information, reference or informational questions asked, interlibrary loan transactions, and computer database searches. This information, however, may be consulted and used by library staff in the course of carrying out library business.
Further information on the UC Berkeley Library Policy on the collection, use, and disclosure of electronic information.
