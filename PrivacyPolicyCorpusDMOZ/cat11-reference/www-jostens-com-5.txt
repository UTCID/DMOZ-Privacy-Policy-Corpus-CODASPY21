Introduction
Jostens, Inc., located at 7760 France Avenue South, Suite 400, Minneapolis, MN 55435, United States of America, and its corporate affiliates (collectively, "Jostens," "we," "our," or "us") are your most trusted partners in celebrating moments that matter, and we value that trust. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains how we collect and use information through jostens.com, services available through jostens.com such as Yearbook Avenue and YearTech Online, and our other websites, applications, widgets, services, and interactive properties on which this Policy appears (each, a "Property"), and your choices with respect to our collection and use of information. This Policy applies to information we collect through Properties regardless of how accessed or used; email or electronic newsletters; offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and any other means or applications you use to connect with us.
This Policy is subject to the Jostens Terms of Use. Each time that you access or use a Property, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use or this Policy, you must discontinue using our Properties.
Privacy Policy Summary
The following is a high-level summary of how we collect and use information. For more details on our collection and use practices, please read our full Privacy Policy.
What information do you collect from and about me?
We collect personal information and other information from you (including content you provide such as photographs) through your use of this Property, through contacts with our customer service and sales associates, from our customers such as schools, and/or through third parties acting on our behalf such as our independent sales representatives. The information you provide us may include information about yourself, such as your name and contact information, as well as information about others, such as through "send-to-a friend" features. We receive information from third parties such as our customers, our partners, and other trusted sources. We also collect information from third party services, e.g., social networking providers, where you integrate your use of a Property with a third party.
What information do you collect when I access and use a Property?
Like most websites and services, we and our third party service providers and advertisers use various technologies, including without limitation cookies, flash cookies, HTML5 cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons, and embedded scripts, to make our Properties work and to learn more about our users and their likely interests. We also receive certain information from your device itself, such as IP address and/or device token. If enabled on your device, we use geolocation to provide you with customized or geographically-specific content. We don't respond to browser-based "do not track" headers.
What do you do with collected information?
We use information we collect to communicate with you about our products or services; to manufacture and produce our products such as yearbooks; to process orders and support our commerce solutions; to provide, manage and improve our Properties, products, services and business; in connection with promotions such as sweepstakes and contests; for us and our service providers to provide services and deliver content; to comply with legal requirements and protect you, Jostens, and others; and in connection with corporate events such as a sale of the business. We use information provided by schools to provide our products and services and as otherwise allowed under this Policy except where a school has restricted our rights to use provided information, and we will not sell or rent such information to any third party. We share your personal information with certain of our partners if you have given us permission to share it with that partner. Except as prohibited by applicable law, we also use your information to personalize your user experience, to improve our Properties, products and services, for fraud prevention, to provide reporting, and for other historical, statistical or research and analysis purposes. If you are outside the US, you give us consent to transfer it to the US.
What choices do I have with respect to your collection and use of information?
You can withdraw your consent to receive promotional communications from us at any time. If you choose not to provide us with the right to use personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service or information you requested. You can use third party sites, services and apps (links are in our full Privacy Policy) to opt out of the collection of your information from certain third parties, such as Google and other third party advertising service providers (if you clear your cookies, you'll need to opt out again). You can also review and update your personal information in our possession.
What else should I know?
Our Properties contain third party links, and we are not responsible for those linked sites and services. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 through our Properties. If you live in California, you have additional rights which we describe in our full Privacy Policy. We update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Feel free to contact us with any privacy-related questions you have using the contact information in our full Privacy Policy.
