Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data
Colorado College (CC) is an institute of higher education involved in education, research, and community service and development.  In order for CC to educate its students, engage in research, and provide community services, it is essential, necessary, and Colorado College has lawful bases to collect, process, use, and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and community programs. The lawful bases include, without limitation, admission, registration, delivery of classroom, field, and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, applied research, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention. Examples of data that Colorado College may need to collect in connection with the lawful bases are: name, email address, IP address, physical address or other location identifier, photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained with prior consent.

For more information regarding the EU GDPR, please review Colorado College’s EU General Data Protection Regulation Compliance Policy.
Most of Colorado College’s collection and processing of personal data will fall under the following categories:
Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Colorado College or third parties in providing education, employment, research and development, and community programs.
Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to research contracts.
Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Colorado College is subject.
The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.  This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to the protection of research subjects, providing medical and mental health services.
There will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases.
Types of Personal Data collected and why

If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by Colorado College (CC) in connection with one of CC’s lawful bases to collect such personal data, such refusal may make it impossible for Colorado College to provide education, employment, research or other requested services.
