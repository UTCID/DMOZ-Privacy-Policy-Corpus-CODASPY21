Thank you for visiting the Whatcom Community College website and reviewing our privacy notice. This statement addresses collection, use, and security of and access to information that may be obtained through use of Whatcom Community College's website.
FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day Whatcom Community College (hereinafter referred to as "the College") receives a request for access. Students should submit to the College Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The College Registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College Registrar to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the College to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the college official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent for disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, third party servicers such as the National Student Clearinghouse, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
Another exception requires the College to comply with the Solomon Amendment, which authorizes disclosure of "student recruitment information" for military recruiting purposes without student consent. Information disclosed is limited to currently enrolled students over the age of 16 and includes name, address, telephone listing, year of birth, class level, academic major, degrees received and most recent previous educational institution. The College considers name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, enrollment status (full or part time), dates of attendance, and degrees/awards received to be "directory information" and this information can be disclosed without consent only if it is determined by a college official that the party requesting this information has a legitimate need for the information. A student has the right to refuse to allow the College to disclose personally identifiable directory/student recruitment information by signing a "Notice of Non-Disclosure" form available at the Registration/Records office. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Whatcom Community College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920. The College will publish this Notice in its College Catalog and on its public website, and will reference it in its Class Schedule publications.
The College's complete FERPA policy is contained in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 132U-280.

Public access to information
In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.
All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. Statue RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that:
Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency's disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
