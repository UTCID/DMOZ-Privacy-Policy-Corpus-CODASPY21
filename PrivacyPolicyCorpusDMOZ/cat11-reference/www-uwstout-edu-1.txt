Third party vendors, including Google, may use cookies on our Site.
We use the Google AdWords remarketing service-including the DoubleClick cookie and remarketing pixels-to advertise on third party sites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the Site. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy statement and Google's policy.
Opting out: You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
We also use certain Google Analytics features-including remarketing and advertising reporting features that leverage cookies and tracking pixels-to monitor user behavior on our site and to better target our advertising efforts.
Opting out: You can install a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.
