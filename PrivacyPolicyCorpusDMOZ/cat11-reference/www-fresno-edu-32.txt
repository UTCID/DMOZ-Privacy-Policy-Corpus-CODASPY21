I understand the aid as offered is to supplement my own resources for payment of my educational costs at Fresno Pacific University. I agree to use the funds for my educational expenses as outlined in the student budget, provided all necessary requirements have been completed. I understand that my award may be adjusted during the year by Student Financial Services due to changes in institutional, State, or Federal funding or to other unknown factors, such as changes in student attrition or percentage of award acceptances.I understand that the Admission's office determines my residency status for tuition purposes. I will update Student Financial Services if my aid status does not match my current residency classification or if my classification is revised at any time.I understand that I must notify Student Financial Services in writing if I withdraw from FPU during a term or do not register for a subsequent term. I also understand that if I withdraw I may be required to repay some of the aid that I have already received. I understand that my aid is based on a full-time course load (12 credits undergraduate, 9 credits graduate), unless I have made specific arrangements in writing with Student Financial Services for a reduced course load.I understand that I am expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress and to complete my degree requirements within a maximum timeframe in order to continue to receive aid. I understand that I am responsible for knowing the most recent standards of satisfactory academic progress policy as noted on the Financial Aid website or hard copy available at the Financial Aid office.I understand that if my parents are interested in the Federal Direct Parent PLUS loan, one parent needs to submit the Parent PLUS loan application found at: studentloans.gov. The parent that completes the Parent Plus loan application must also complete and sign the Master Promissory Note (MPN) at: studentloans.gov, if a first time Parent Plus loan borrower.I understand that if I am a first time borrower accepting the Federal Ford Direct student loan, I am required to complete an Entrance Counseling session at: studentloans.gov and sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) at: studentloans.gov.I understand that if Federal Work-Study is part of my aid, I must work to earn the amount of this award. I understand that the wage will be at least the State minimum wage and that I cannot work more than 20 hours in a week while school is in session. For more information visit the Federal Work Study page.I understand that the scholarships, grants and student loans listed on my award letter are part of my aid package information.I agree to report to FPU Student Financial Services any additional assistance I may receive at any time throughout the school year. This includes, but is not limited to, all departmental scholarships, outside scholarships, stipends, fellowships, GTA positions, room and board allowances or subsidies, vocational rehabilitation, staff rates, tuition waivers, BIA, etc. I understand that additional assistance may result in a reduction of my award and/or require repayment of financial aid already received.Loan Cancellation NoticeAny loan(s) disbursed to your student account will apply towards your university charges first. Please note the disbursed amount reflected is the NET amount after the Direct Loan Servicer has deducted the required loan fee(s). You have the right to cancel all or a portion of your loan(s) within 14 days of being notified funds have been applied to your student account, or within 14 days after the start of the semester, whichever is later.
