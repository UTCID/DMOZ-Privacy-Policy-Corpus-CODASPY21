Collection Development Policy - Electronic Resources
Electronic Resources
Introduction
The policy for collecting and providing access to electronic resources addresses specific issues that relate to the electronic format. It is divided into three sections:
Electronic Journals
Electronic Books
Other Electronic Resources
The principles contained in the general and subject specific sections of The Bunker Hill Community College Library Collection Development Policy apply equally to electronic resources. As with other materials, librarian liaisons assess present curriculum and teaching needs, select materials that meet the Library's standards in regard to quality, comprehensiveness, and authoritativeness, and weigh the purchase of a particular resource against other possible acquisitions from materials budgets. Issues of accessibility for users with differing abilities will also be taken into consideration.
Notable, The Bunker Hill Community College is a member of MCCLPHEI and NOBLE consortiums. BHCC Library negotiates vendor/publisher licensing agreements for electronic resources, if needed.
BHCC Library will take all reasonable steps to comply with licenses and to inform its users of relevant licensing restrictions. Authorized users for on-campus access shall be defined as all current faculty, students and staff of The Bunker Hill Community College, as well as patrons (NOBLE, MCCLPHEI members) who are walk-in end users physically present in the BHCC Library.
Remote access will be extended to all authorized end users defined above except BHCC Librarians reserve the right to evaluate and make decisions about the appropriateness of walk-in users.
BHCC Library and The IT Department work to ensure that remote access is restricted to only appropriate authorized end users by implementing an authentication process such as a proxy server or virtual private network.
The rapidly evolving nature of electronic formats will necessitate regular review of this policy.
Electronic Journals
Scope
This policy addresses the selection, acquisition and delivery of electronic journals accessible via the Web ("e-journals"). Access may be the result of:
Single-title electronic-only subscriptions
Multi-title electronic packages ordered from publishers
Electronic versions bundled with print subscriptions (i.e., where electronic full-text is available only to print subscribers)
Aggregate products from information providers such as EBSCO, Gale, or ProQuest (The Library has no control over the content of these collections.)
Free access (These are not always cataloged, and in some cases may be linked only from library web pages.)
Access
BHCC Library maximizes access to e-journals by several means:
Bibliographic and holdings records and associated hypertext links are added to the Library’s catalog for all e-journals in the first three categories above
Cataloged e-journals, as well as those in the remaining two categories, are also listed by title using the Library’s electronic resource access management system
Support and training to optimize use
Selection Responsibility
Selection decisions rest with:  The Director of the Library & Learning Commons; with assistance and recommendations by Librarian Liaisons, Faculty Liaisons; the Library Committee Members, and Students.
Selection Criteria
Librarians will consider the following criteria when recommending a new electronic-only title or transferring a subscription from print to electronic format or from one electronic or selecting version to another:
Coverage and the timely availability of material
Enhanced contents and additional functionality of electronic as compared with print
Convenience for users, e.g., unrestricted access in terms of location and time
Reliability of access
Full-text availability in PDF or other commonly used electronic format
Cost-effectiveness, e.g., subscription savings, lower handling and overhead costs, number of simultaneous users included in license terms
Guaranteed access to a complete file of titles for the years of the subscription
Publisher commitment to maintaining web access to a permanent archive of back-issues
Availability of usage statistics to support evidence-based decisions on future title additions or deletions
Availability of IP authentication
Use of licensed content to fill interlibrary loan requests
Duplication
BHCC Library will only consider providing both print and electronic access to a journal under certain circumstances. See the discussion of Format in the Serials section above.
If a print subscription is exchanged for an electronic version and it is found that the content coverage, and/or text and illustration format of a particular article, or articles, in the electronic version, differs from the printed version of the journal, then BHCC Library will bear the total cost of obtaining a full and accurate copy of the printed version of the article or articles.
In cases where the electronic version of a cancelled print title ceases to be accessible, BHCC Library will consider resuming the print subscription and purchasing back issues if warranted.
Electronic Books, Etc.
Scope
This policy addresses the selection, acquisition and delivery of electronic books or other non-serial electronic resources, such as government documents, research reports, websites, image files, etc.
These include:
Individual or collections of electronic-only books, etc., ordered direct from the publisher or through a vendor
Electronic versions available with print purchases
Electronic books, etc., available freely on the web (These are not always cataloged, and in some cases may be linked only from library web pages.)
Access
BHCC Library maximizes access to electronic books, etc., by several means:
Bibliographic records and associated hypertext links added to the Library’s catalog
Loading and maintaining necessary software within the Library
Support and training to optimize use
Selection Responsibility
Selection decisions rest with:  The Director of the Library & Learning Commons; with assistance and recommendations by Librarian Liaisons, Faculty Liaisons; the Library Committee Members, and Students.
Selection Criteria
When selecting an electronic title, whether new or the equivalent of an existing print title in the collection: The Director of the Library; Librarian Liaisons; Chairs and Faculty (Departmental Liaisons) will consider the following criteria
Demand (priority being given to anticipated high-demand and reference-type material)
Suitability to curricular support
Currency and comprehensiveness
Cost, e.g., handling and overhead costs, number of simultaneous users included in license terms
Enhanced contents and additional functionality
Ease of use and convenience for users, e.g., unrestricted access in terms of location and time
Reliable, stable and permanent access
Appropriateness of format, e.g., file size, supported software clients
Availability of usage statistics to support evidence-based decisions on future title additions or deletions
Availability of content on the Library’s preferred platforms
Duplication
BHCC Library may provide both print and electronic access to particular monograph titles if this is justified by demand or preservation requirements. Electronic resources are selected to support the curriculum. The purpose of electronic resources is to provide alternative and supplementary access to information. For library collection development, "electronic resources" are defined as resources that require computer access. Examples include, but are not limited to: electronic journals, electronic books, streaming videos, reference databases, Adobe Acrobat PDF documents (government documents, working papers, conference proceedings and theses), and web sites.
e-Books
The Bunker Hill Community College Librarians are growing electronic books collection to supplement the print book collection. We seek a balance between print and e-books, and will follow the same selection criteria as previously stated.
The following criteria will be considered when purchasing or renewing college wide electronic resources: Supports the curriculum; Subject area/coverage; Availability of funds; Search features and functionality; Price; Existing coverage within the electronic resources collection; Statistics (by vendor, classroom usage, other).
Students are encouraged to recommend e-book acquisitions. And faculty members wishing to recommend electronic resources should communicate any information they have to the director of the library and instructor’s library liaison for consideration in the next purchasing cycle.
Collection Development Policy - Selection Criteria
Detailed Guidelines for Selecting Materials
Definitions:
Monographs
For the purposes of this document, a monograph is defined as any non-serial item (i.e., an item either complete in one part or complete, or intended to be completed, in a finite number of separate parts). Included in this definition are books, reference works, musical scores, films, etc. Monographs may be considered for selection in any suitable format collected by the Library.
In general, print will still be favored for:
Titles with significant cost increases for online access
Titles for which the quality of online graphics is not high enough to support its primary uses
Titles with limited assurance of perpetual access
Titles with license conditions that would restrict the usefulness of the title - e.g., provisions restricting use in electronic reserves
Core journals where ease of use and dissemination (e.g., browsing) are better than e-format
Print + Electronic will be selected if:
The cost of print includes online access is available
Electronic only to print subscribers (Titles with rolling back files will only have online access implemented when there is substantial content)
Electronic content coverage is not identical to that of the print version, or the text or illustration format of the print and electronic versions is not of the same quality
Print versions are needed to enable accurate references to an official or authoritative version (including those recognized in court hearings)
Electronic publication significantly lags behind the print edition
The publisher has no commitment to archiving the electronic version
Access
BHCC Library is a member of the NOBLE (North of Boston Library Exchange) consortium and a member of MCCLPHEI (Massachusetts Commonwealth Consortium of Libraries in Public Higher Education).
Bibliographic and holdings records, including associated hypertext links for monographs in electronic formats are added to the Library’s catalog.
The Library catalog is available through the College’s website, the Library’s homepage, and connects end users (students, faculty) everywhere (i.e., physical classroom, blended/hybrid, distance/online) and regardless of mode of delivery of courses.
Selection Responsibility
Selection decisions rest with:  The Director of the Library & Learning Commons; with assistance and recommendations by Librarian Liaisons, Faculty Liaisons; the Library Committee Members, and Students.
– Collaboration—the Library Liaison Program is Ongoing
The Director of the Library & Learning Commons and BHCC Librarians
Faculty (full-time and part-time including adjunct and new faculty members’ participation)
Content selection decisions rest with Liaisons (Librarian Liaisons and Faculty Library Liaisons). Yet all faculty members (new, adjunct, full-time, part-time) are responsible for recommending
Library‘s resources in their subject area.
Duplication
BHCC Library normally purchases only one copy of a title but may provide both print and e-book access to particular monograph titles if this is justified by demand or preservation requirements.
Serials
Scope
A serial is a publication issued in successive parts bearing numerical or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. Included in this definition are scholarly and professional journals, trade publications, newspapers, general interest periodicals, indexes and abstracts, loose leaf services, etc. The collection encompasses paper, electronic and microform formats. Additional considerations for electronic subscriptions are available in the Electronic Resources Policy.
Serials represent an ongoing commitment on the part of BHCC Library. They are costly to purchase, process, store, and maintain. The cost of serials has dramatically increased in recent decades and continues to rise, so the Library must be judicious in adding serials. Careful consideration is important when making a request for a new subscription, or when reviewing current holdings.
Selection Priorities and Criteria
Titles critical for the ongoing support of current curriculum, including general education, ESL, Science, Engineering, Math, Technology (STEM), Allied Health, Business and Government, Criminal Justice, Careers and Professions, Nursing
Titles in support of a new area of focus that an academic department or program and the College Administration intend to continue supporting receive high priority. For example Paralegal Studies, Tax … and other new programs
Titles likely to be used by more than one department receive strong consideration
Titles recommended by accrediting agencies receive strong consideration
Titles that exclusively support individual faculty teaching/course are given low priority (The Library serves the specific needs of faculty in this situation through interlibrary loan, commercial document delivery, and providing either direct borrowing or access privileges for onsite use of other collections in the area.)
Titles frequently requested through Interlibrary Loan or document delivery over a number of years (These requests are indicators of the degree of demand for titles not owned.)
Titles of a recreational, cultural, or broad informational nature maybe included, but low priority, and based on budget and interest, and needs where possible.
Title cost (not given undue weight unless it exceeds the average cost of a journal in its field
Titles indexed or abstracted in one or more of the databases, indexing, or abstracting services available through the Library (These are given more favorable consideration since these titles will be more accessible and more apt to be used by BHCC community.)
Titles of high intrinsic quality (as demonstrated by the following indicators) receive more favorable consideration:
1. Reputation of editors, contributors, publishers reviews                  2. Journal ranking studies                  3. Quality of production, e.g., paper, typeface, graphics, special features, online interface                  4. Currency and regular publication of issues
Formats of Materials Collected
Print
BHCC Library acquires materials in print when that is the most appropriate, available format.
Electronic
BHCC Library purchases or licenses resources in electronic form using the guidelines in the Electronic Resources section, below. Audiovisual Recordings
BHCC Library purchases or licenses audio and audiovisual recordings using the guidelines in the Media section and, when applicable, in the Electronic Resources section, below.
Microforms
BHCC Library does not acquire microform resources.
Format (print or non-print, e-resources)
In principle, electronic subscriptions to journals and newspapers will be preferred over print when access, usability, licensing and cost considerations are resolved satisfactorily. Reasons for this preference include broad and immediate access, support of users in remote locations or during the hours when the Library is closed, simultaneous availability of a single article to multiple users, ease of integration into electronic reserves, simpler copyright compliance for electronic reserves, the availability of usage statistics, cost savings for shelving and a general end user preference for online access as indicated in Student Survey, Faculty Survey and other data collections.
In general, print will still be favored for:
titles with significant cost increases for online access
titles for which the quality of online graphics is not high enough to support its primary uses
titles with limited assurance of perpetual access
titles with license conditions that would restrict the usefulness of the title - e.g., provisions restricting use in electronic reserves
core journals where ease of use and dissemination (e.g., browsing) are better than e-format
popular magazines
Print + Electronic will be selected if:
the cost of print includes online
electronic access is available only to print subscribers (Titles with rolling back files will only have online access implemented when there is substantial content)
electronic content coverage is not identical to that of the print version, or the text or illustration format of the print and electronic versions is not of the same quality
print versions are needed to enable accurate references to an official or authoritative version (including those recognized in court hearings)
electronic publication significantly lags behind the print edition
the publisher has no commitment to archiving the electronic version
Microforms are not collected.  The format does not lend itself to space savings, and no equipment (no microfiche or microfilm readers).
Collection Development Policy - Online Access
Online Library Access and Password
The Library provides access to many online resources, including a website, electronic databases, and an online catalog.
The catalog also serves as a gateway to the patron’s library account, where the patron can log in using a library password to see his current checkouts, renew items, and request materials from NOBLE libraries through interlibrary loan. The library password is also used to access the electronic databases from off- campus. Patrons must have a library barcode to get and/or use the library password.
Passwords may be obtained in person at the Lending Services Desk or online through the password reset feature, if you have an email address on file. To get a password in person, come to the library and bring your OneCard, ID card, or temporary barcode. To log into your library account or request a password reset online, go to library’s website.
Collection Development Policy - Reserves
Materials to Support New Programs
In order to respond to collection development needs of existing and newly developed courses and programs of instruction, librarians attend college wide meetings, including the monthly College Forums, and this is where they learn about new programs.  The liaison program is also in place to learn about changes to the existing courses and within departments.
Professional Materials
Librarian liaisons and faculty/course instructors work collaboratively to identify and acquire professional materials to assist faculty in preparation for teaching, to support programs undergoing program review, to support faculty development and continuing education, and to assist faculty, administrators, and staff in performance of their duties.
Out-of-Print Materials
Requests for books, which are determined to be out-of-print, may be ordered from out-of-print sources. A librarian will assist in determining the appropriateness for the collection and a price range for the material, and may offer alternatives when necessary.
Government Documents
Government publications are ordered as needed and are integrated into the collections.
Serials
The purpose of the serials collection is to provide up-to-date information and to supplement the book collection. Considering the costs of storage, preservation and maintenance, serials purchases are made based on the following criteria: Availability in online databases Appropriateness to the curriculum existing subscriptions within the field Demonstrated need Scholarly reputation Price Program accreditation requirements Faculty development Student interest

Collection Development Policy - Archives
Archives Mission & Goals
The Archives are the repository of official college records for Bunker Hill Community College, charged with identifying, collecting, preserving, and making available for research and reference College records of enduring historical value.
The primary purpose for collecting such records is to document the history and development of Bunker Hill Community College since its foundation in 1973, and, in particular, to provide documentation of its teaching, learning, and research functions; the activities of its diverse student body and alumni; its role in the state of Massachusetts and the community at large; and its place in American higher education and workforce development.
The goals of the BHCC Archives are:
To ensure the long-term preservation and storage of historical records pertaining to Bunker Hill Community College.
To efficiently manage its collections.
To continually improve access to and encourage the use of collections by the College, the community, and interested researchers.
Archives and Special Collections
The Bunker Hill Community College Archives has historical, visual, digital, and audio collections. Come learn about Harold Shively, the college's founding President, and be sure to view the Special Exhibition display, located underneath his portrait, detailing his tenure. Come peruse our collection of Third Rail, BHCC's original student-run newspaper. Want to learn how the Computer Science department has changed since the 1980s? We have a complete collection of course offering booklets from the beginning! We also have available a large collection of faculty publications, photographs, and donated items from a wide variety of departments on campus. (Not to mention, information about the prison that once stood on this site!) You can use the Archives to:
Conduct research for your assignments, papers, and projects
Learn more about the history of the College and surrounding community
Learn more about the individuals – faculty, staff, students, and alumni – associated at the college, and hear their stories
Get involved with the college community – volunteering is always a great boost, whether for a transfer application or a resume. Currently, the Archives is looking for student volunteers to work on an Oral History project, with opportunities to interview staff and faculty for the upcoming 30th anniversary.
Publications Collections
BHCC Faculty & Staff Publications
Dissertations
Records Groups
RG14 Sabbatical Reports
RG15 NEASC Index (2000)
These are but two of the many record groups that we collect and maintain in Archives.  Please contact BHCC’s librarians to set an appointment to access the archives if you are interested in seeing what more we have.
Photographs
The Archives houses many photographs from all points of the College's history.
Archives Projects
During the past years, BHCC Library and Librarians have been fortunate to have a relationship with other colleges and universities.  For example, Simmons Archives students have worked in the BHCC Archives housed in the library as interns. Usually library and information science graduate students have unique interest like those archive interns have an interest in Archival Methods, Digitization, and Services. Simmons archives interns may get valuable experience through BHCC’s Archives and Special
Collections projects, which includes a 60 hour internship in an archives. Feedback and suggestions are provided by BHCC Librarians on processing unprocessed items, updating the archives index and accompanying finding aids and making suggestions for future physical and digitization projects.
Collection Development Policy - Donations
DONATION OF MATERIALS CONDITIONS OF ACCEPTANCE
The BHCC Library requires that donations should fall within the scope of the BHCC Library collection development policy and be in good physical condition.
Given the Library’s limited space, donations are accepted on the basis that the processed materials become the property of the Library and are integrated into the existing collection.
Materials not generally accepted as donations include: outdated books, newspapers, popular magazines and incomplete sets of serials.  The library did recently acquire a complete set of National Geographics through a donation.
Selection Responsibility
Selection decisions rest with:  The Director of the Library & Learning Commons, and with BHCC’s Librarians.
Selection Criteria
Suggested donations which organize, describe, make available, and preserve records of historical, legal, fiscal, and/or administrative value to the Bunker Hill Community College.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DONATIONS
Donations are acknowledged by a letter from the BHCC Library. A bookplate will also be placed in each item if requested.
All persons wishing to donate material to the BHCC Library must complete and sign the form with attached list of materials, description of which includes Author, title, date of publication, publisher, ISBN, and more).
The Library does not provide adequate facilities for the retention of stuff which faculty (especially retiring faculty) and other members of BHCC’s community would like to warehouse
Collection Development Policy - Deselection
Deselection
To assure an effective current collection that best serves the educational mission of the college, the Library systematically removes obsolete, damaged and little-used materials from the collection.
“Little used” is quantifiable based on the following research methods: circulation usage statistics, interviews with faculty and students and staff.
Deselection is the responsibility of the professional librarians (full time and part time). The following criteria are considered when discarding materials:
Obsolescence
Physical condition
Significance
Usage
Faculty recommendation
Duplication
Program profiles
Accreditation requirements
Availability of newer materials
Collection analysis and evaluation
Guidelines for Deselecting Electronic Resources
Evaluation and deselection of electronic resources is an ongoing process using the following criteria:
Currency
Reliability of the resource's information.
Another source offers more comprehensive coverage.
Cost
We are always glad to hear from students, faculty and staff.   We want to help you see a problem in the Library--limited space, growing organism; and need for accreditation/re-accreditation).  Suggest to us how you see the problem, discuss what you know about it and what, why you see the solution.
Beyond service providers--we want to transfer our knowledge about the role of academic libraries, resources and services that support teaching and learning. We want to give collection development, specifically the deselection process, time so that we can all do self-study. We welcome you and lists and resources you gather to help solve the problem. We are all focusing on the goal: to promote student success and the needed resources to solve the problem. Then we will re-assess the collection and collective understanding of the problem.  When we solve the problem, we can move forward, and the process of building and maintaining a healthy library organism begins anew.
