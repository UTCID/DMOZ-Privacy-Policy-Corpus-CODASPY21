Introduction
We are Virtual College Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales. Our company number is 03052439 and our registered office is at Marsel House, Stephensons Way, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, LS29 8DD (“Virtual College” / “we”/ “our” / “us”).
We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and we strictly adhere to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) unless and until GDPR is no longer directly applicable in the UK, together with the Data Protection Act 2018, any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation as amended or updated from time to time in the UK, and any successor legislation to GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (Data Protection Legislation).
In order for Virtual College to provide, our products and services we need to process a certain amount of data, some of which is personally identifiable.
Our Privacy Policy sets out the different kinds of personal data we process, how we collect it, what processing is carried out, who personal data is shared with, how long we keep personal data and how we safeguard it along with details of your rights relating to data protection and how to contact the ICO, the UK’s data protection regulator.

Where a learner has accessed or is allocated a Virtual College course, directly from Virtual College, Virtual College is the data controller.
If your login details or training has been provided by a 3rd party (e.g. your employer, another training organisation or a Virtual College reseller) then they will be joint data controller, along with Virtual College where applicable and also have access to and will be processing your personal data.
Should you require any further information you should contact them directly. If you are unsure who to contact Virtual College may be able to assist, please email customersupport@virtual-college.co.uk. .
Where a 3rd party has provided system access, and no Virtual College content is allocated to the user, then Virtual College is a data processer, and the relevant 3rd party sole data controller.

We may also charge if you request more than one copy of the same information.
We will provide the information you request as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receiving your request, unless there are extenuating circumstances. If we need more information to comply with your request, we’ll let you know.

The right to erasure
In some circumstances, you have the right to ask us to delete personal data we hold about you. This right is available to you:
where we no longer need your personal data for the purpose for which we collected it;
where we have collected your personal data on the grounds of consent and you withdraw that consent;
where you object to the processing and we don’t have any overriding legitimate interests to continuing processing the data;
where we have unlawfully processed your personal data (i.e. we have failed to comply with GDPR);
where the personal data has to be deleted to comply with a legal obligation; and
where the personal data we process relates to the offer of online services to a child.
There are certain scenarios in which we are entitled to refuse to comply with a request. If any of those apply, we’ll let you know.
To request that your information is deleted, please contact us at customersupport@virtual-college.co.uk.
The right to restrict / object to processing
In some circumstances you are entitled to ask us to suppress processing of your personal data. This means we will stop actively processing your personal data but we don’t have to delete it. This right is available to you:
if you believe the personal data we hold isn’t accurate – we’ll cease processing it until we can verify its accuracy;
if you have objected to us processing the data (see below) – we’ll cease processing it until we have determined whether our legitimate interests override your objection;
if the processing is unlawful; or
if we no longer need the data but you would like us to keep it because you need it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
You are entitled to object to us processing your personal data:
if the processing is based on legitimate interests or performance of a task in the public interest or exercise of official authority;
for direct marketing purposes (including profiling); and/or
for the purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics.

where we carry out the processing by automated means.
We’ll respond to your request as soon as possible and in any event within one month from the date we receive it. If we need more time, we’ll let you know.
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling
Automated decision making means making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement. This would include, for example, an online credit reference check that makes a decision based on information you input without any human involvement. It would also include the use of an automated clocking-in system that automatically issues a warning if a person is late a certain number of times (without any input from HR, for example).
