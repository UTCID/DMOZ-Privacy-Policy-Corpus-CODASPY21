Information Technology Acceptable Use
Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy
Franklin University promotes the use of electronic communication, telecommunication and computing resources for the purposes of University instruction, advancement, administration, research and study. All users are required to respect applicable copyright, privacy and licensing regulations. It is the responsibility of all users to uphold the integrity and validity of information contained in the University databases and communications.
Electronic Communication:
Anonymous Activity -- Sending information that does not correctly identify the sender is a violation of this policy unless the recipient expressly requests and accepts anonymous information. Further, users should not disguise or attempt to disguise their identity or the identity of the part of the electronic system they are using unless expressly requested and accepted by the recipient.
Communication tampering and privacy:
Franklin University provides electronic communication to faculty, staff and students at the University's expense for their use on University business and incidentally for personal purposes, so long as it does not violate University policy or adversely affect others.
It is in violation of this policy to monitor or attempt to monitor other people's communications without their permission. Likewise, users should not view, read, listen to, copy, change, execute or delete another user's information without that user's or the owner's permission. This includes but is not limited to monitoring, reading or tampering with electronic communication of which an individual is neither the author nor the addressee. In particular, users should not read, listen to or view electronic communication without the consent of the addressee. Exceptions for legitimate purposes should be obtained from the System Administrator. The System Administrator may read, or authorize electronic systems "postmasters" to read electronic files as necessary in order to correct addresses on "dead letters," perform other diagnostic tasks or assure compliance with University policy.
The ability of the University to protect privacy is limited to the on-campus network and does not extend outside Franklin.
The policies described apply to both electronic messages currently stored online as well as archived files.
Usage Guidelines:
Always keep in mind the fact that electronic communication does not carry the body language or voice inflection of regular conversation. It is all too easy to be insulting when you mean to be funny. Learn what the various smiley characters mean.
When you respond to an article or mail, ask yourself if your response will be interesting to everybody, just the author or just you.
When you start reading a newsgroup for the first time, look for and read the FAQ (frequently asked questions) article before you submit any articles of your own.
Include a signature on all Usenet articles which indicates that the post does not represent the University's position.
Restrict your signature to four lines or less.
Governing Legislation Users who develop new packages that include components subject to use, copying, or redistribution restrictions have the responsibility to make any such restrictions known to the users of those packages.
Penalties for Misuse:
Users who violate the Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy will be subject to discipline which may include loss of system user privileges.
