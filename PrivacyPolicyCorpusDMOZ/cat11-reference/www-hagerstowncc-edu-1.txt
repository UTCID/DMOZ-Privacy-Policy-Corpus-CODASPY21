The college will not collect personal information about visitors unless the person affirmatively chooses to make such information available. The college web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which a visitor accesses the website. This information will not result in the identification of personal email addresses or other personal information. However, information regarding the volume and timing of access to the website is collected. This information is collected to improve the content of the college website and is not shared with other organizations.
Only aggregate information is collected and visitors’ personal information is not identified. If a visitor chooses to share personal information with the college—by sending a message, or filling out an electronic form with personal information—the college will use the information only for the purposes intended. Information will not be disclosed to other third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by local, state or federal laws.
