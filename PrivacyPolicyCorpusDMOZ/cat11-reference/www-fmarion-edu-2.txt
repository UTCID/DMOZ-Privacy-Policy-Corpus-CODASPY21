All special activity letters and printed brochures should clearly instruct recipients to mail registration forms and money to the Cashier’s Office. A receipt will be generated and mailed to the payee. The registration form and a copy of the receipt will be forwarded to the activity director. All material requesting payments should be reviewed by the Assistant Vice President for Accounting prior to printing.
Anyone collecting money must utilize a Francis Marion University prenumbered receipt book. Receipt books should be obtained from the Cashier’s Office several days in advance, and questions regarding collection procedures should be resolved at that time. The only exceptions are pre-approved and prenumbered tickets and certain departments that have in place alternative auditable procedures.
In any case where these guidelines are not followed, an “Explanation of Non-Adherence to Revenue Collection Guidelines” form must be completed and signed, and then submitted to the appropriate Vice President for approval.
Supplementary W-2'sUniversity employees may receive an additional W-2 if one of the following situations occurred during the calendar year:
1.  The employee received reimbursement for business meals while in a non-travel status.
2.  The employee received reimbursement for meals while on a one-day trip.
3.  The employee received reimbursement for taxable moving expenses.
4.  The employee received reimbursement for other working condition fringes which are not specifically excluded as a business expense under the Internal Revenue Code.
Past Due BalanceIt is the policy of Francis Marion University that a student will not be allowed to register for a subsequent semester until all past due financial obligations are paid.  The University may not furnish transcripts if a student is diligent in paying on a student account or student loan obligations.  An account deemed uncollectible by the University may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to a collection agency.
Travel Polices: Faculty, Staff, and StudentsAlthough travel funds are limited, the University encourages attendance at off-campus professional activities by assisting with travel expenses.   It is expected that the budgets of all departments will be adequate to provide some financial assistance for professional travel.  At the same time, employees may be expected to share the cost of professional travel, especially when meetings are held at a great distance from the campus.
Vehicles Dispatched by the University (University owned or rented) University vehicles are to be used when available but cannot be taken on trips extending over a considerable time period.  When vehicles are dispatched by the University, they will be charged to the Department’s budget at the rate of 58 cents per mile or the cost of the rental and fuel. The 2018-2019 General Appropriations Act in Proviso 117.21.J provides for mileage reimbursements at the standard business mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service rate will be 58 cents per mile (IRS Revenue IR 2013-95). Reimbursement for trips taken on or after January 1, 2019, will be at the rate of 58 cents per mile.
Link to Facilities Management- Vehicle Reservations/ Rentals.
Travel Request and Reimbursement Forms
The form to be used in conjunction with travel is available from Accounting.  The upper travel request portion of this form is to be completed by the Traveler and submitted to the Department Chairman or Supervisor in advance of a scheduled trip.  The gold copy of the approved request should be submitted to Accounting if registration fees and/or airline tickets are to be paid in advance, if a vehicle is to be rented, or if a travel advance is requested.  The pink copy of the approved request is submitted to the Facilities Management Office to reserve a vehicle.  Upon return, the Traveler completes the reimbursement portion of the form, obtains appropriate approval and submits the original form to Accounting in order that the reimbursements for approved expenses can be made.
Any foreign travel of a State employee must be reported by the University to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of  the House, and the Budget and Control Board at the end of the fiscal year.  For the purpose of this regulation, foreign travel is defined as any destination outside the continental limits of the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  Other travel is reported by individual as requested by the Office of the Comptroller General.
Airfare
The traveler should make inquiries several weeks before the trip in order to receive the best rates.  If a pre-approved travel agency is used to book the ticket, Accounting must receive an approved travel request with ticket cost and appropriate budget number in order to authorize the charge.  The traveler may do an online purchase and receive reimbursement upon return from the trip.  A receipt showing proof of payment must be indicated on the itinerary for the cost of the ticket.  The traveler may have to return to the website 24 hours later to print a receipt or in some cases, the traveler may receive a receipt via e-mail.  Credit card statements are not valid receipts as indicated on the travel request form.  The traveler may also call Accounts Payable to set up an appointment to purchase the ticket online with the University’s travel card.  The traveler must have an approved travel request with estimated ticket cost and appropriate budget number.
Allowances
Employees traveling on official business of the University may, upon presentation of a paid receipt, be allowed reimbursement for actual expenses incurred for lodging, limited to in-state costs per night of $125.00 and out-of-state costs of similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00 per night.
Employees may also be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred in the obtaining of meals except that such costs shall not exceed $25.00 per day in-state and $32.00 per day out-of-state.
The mileage reimbursements at the rate of 53.5 cents per mile will be made when an employee uses a personal automobile in travelling on University business.  Travel by commercial airlines is encouraged so valuable time will not be spent in slower ground travel.   Total transportation allowance will not exceed tourist airfare.
Special Rules
Reimbursement will be made for meals for trips of a day’s duration or shorter.   Regulations appearing below will apply.  In accordance with Internal Revenue requirements, the appropriate tax form will be generated reflecting such reimbursements.
Receipts for meal and taxi expenditures are not necessary.  Receipts for all other expenditures must be submitted.  The State will not accept cancelled checks or copies of credit card invoices in lieu of receipts.
No reimbursement for overnight accommodation will be made within fifty (50) miles of the traveler’s official headquarters and/or residence.
Registration receipts must accompany travel voucher.
Employees earning frequent flyer premiums while traveling on State business must use them to reduce the cost of subsequent business travel whenever possible.
Method of Determining Maximum Subsistence
This procedure should be used in completing the Travel Request portion of the form prior to departure and the Travel Reimbursement section of the form on returning from trips.
1.  Single Calendar Day-When reimbursements for meals are claimed, the time of arrival and departure as well as the starting point and destination must be shown.  In determining the maximum amount of subsistence for meals which may be reimbursed, the following time schedule will be adhered to:

2.  Overnight Travel-When a University employee is traveling in or out of the State on official University business, the following maximum reimbursement for subsistence will apply:
Meals – The cost of meals will be reimbursed up to the maximum amount as provided for in the single calendar day schedule above.  The time limitations for breakfast will not apply for overnight trips.  Time of Departure and Time of Arrival must be indicated for the first and the last day of the trip.
Hotel/Motel – Actual hotel/motel costs will be  reimbursed when a paid original receipt is presented and attached to the travel voucher.  It is expected that persons traveling for Francis Marion University generally will limit in-state hotel/motel costs to $125.00 and out-of-state costs to similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00.  Exceeding these limits will require special justification to be approved by the appropriate Vice President.
Parking – Parking fees for State-owned and privately owned vehicles are reimbursable upon presentation of a paid receipt.
Porterage and Gratuities – Gratuities are not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  When paid as part of a billing for a banquet, luncheon, etc., gratuities will be allowed.  Porterage, in general, is not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  It may be reimbursed when an employee flies to a major city out-of-state where there is no option concerning baggage handling.   Porterage may also be reimbursed when an employee has heavy, excess equipment needed to conduct official University business.
Travel Request forms may be obtained from Accounting.

2.11.2 Physical Resources
2.11.2 The institution has adequate physical resources to support the mission of the institution and the scope of its programs and services. (Physical resources) [Directions from the SACS Resource Manual]
Rationale and Notes  Adequate physical resources are essential to the educational environment and include well maintained buildings and grounds that are safe and appropriate for the scope of the institution’s programs and services. It is reasonable that the general public and current and prospective students expect the institution to have sufficient physical resources necessary to fulfill its mission as an ongoing concern.
Relevant Questions for Consideration
How does the institution demonstrate that the physical resources of the institution are adequate in quality, scope, and condition to support the mission of its programs and services?
How does the institution evaluate the appropriateness and sufficiency of physical resources at off-campus instructional sites?
Required Documentation, if applicable  Documentation of the adequacy and condition of physical resources at all locations

Great Colleges Topline Survey    This survey shows that our faculty/staff are more pleased with our Facilities at 88% than the 2016 Honor Roll schools at 81% or the 2016 Carnegie Master’s Schools at 73%.  This note can be added to the report in response to the Armacost quote “Do you do any surveys of faculty and students about facilities?”
3.11.1 Control of Physical Resources
3.11.1 The institution exercises appropriate control over all its physical resources. (Control of physical resources)
Rationale and Notes  Physical resource management is critical to the long-term stability of an institution. The institution has a fiduciary responsibility to operate in a prudent and responsible manner. This responsibility extends to the care for its physical assets by obtaining, sustaining, and maintaining them for achieving its mission. This requires the institution to employ qualified staff empowered to provide systems and procedures for adequate checks, balances, and control over assets.
Relevant Questions for Consideration
Does the institution have accurate and up-to-date records of its physical inventory?
Is proper documentation maintained to explain asset disposals?
How does the institution manage deferred maintenance?
How does the institution manage risk as it relates to physical resources?
Required Documentation, if applicable  None noted

3.11.3 Physical Facilities
3.11.3 The institution operates and maintains physical facilities, both on and off campus, that appropriately serve the needs of the institution’s educational programs, support services, and other mission-related activities. (Physical facilities)
Rationale and Notes  Within the mission and purpose of the institution is the need to operate and maintain physical facilities adequate to serve the educational programs, support services, and other mission related activities. Adequate, well-maintained facilities for all programs enable an institution to achieve its educational goals and to more effectively serve its constituents.
Relevant Questions for Consideration
Is there a master facility plan in place designed to meet current and future needs of the institution? How is it revised and updated?
Is the technological infrastructure sufficient for the needs of the institution, especially for distance and correspondence education programming?
What is the institution’s plan for routine and preventative maintenance?
What is the institution’s deferred maintenance plan?
How do the physical facilities support the needs of the institution’s educational programs, support services, and other mission-related activities?
How does the institution provide adequate physical facilities at off-campus sites?
Does the institution use surveys to determine whether physical facilities meet the needs of users?

Travel Polices: Faculty, Staff, and StudentsAlthough travel funds are limited, the University encourages attendance at off-campus professional activities by assisting with travel expenses.   It is expected that the budgets of all departments will be adequate to provide some financial assistance for professional travel.  At the same time, employees may be expected to share the cost of professional travel, especially when meetings are held at a great distance from the campus.
Vehicles Dispatched by the University (University owned or rented) University vehicles are to be used when available but cannot be taken on trips extending over a considerable time period.  When vehicles are dispatched by the University, they will be charged to the Department’s budget at the rate of 58 cents per mile or the cost of the rental and fuel. The 2018-2019 General Appropriations Act in Proviso 117.21.J provides for mileage reimbursements at the standard business mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service rate will be 58 cents per mile (IRS Revenue IR 2013-95). Reimbursement for trips taken on or after January 1, 2019, will be at the rate of 58 cents per mile.

Travel Request and Reimbursement Forms
The form to be used in conjunction with travel is available from Accounting.  The upper travel request portion of this form is to be completed by the Traveler and submitted to the Department Chairman or Supervisor in advance of a scheduled trip.  The gold copy of the approved request should be submitted to Accounting if registration fees and/or airline tickets are to be paid in advance, if a vehicle is to be rented, or if a travel advance is requested.  The pink copy of the approved request is submitted to the Facilities Management Office to reserve a vehicle.  Upon return, the Traveler completes the reimbursement portion of the form, obtains appropriate approval and submits the original form to Accounting in order that the reimbursements for approved expenses can be made.
Any foreign travel of a State employee must be reported by the University to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of  the House, and the Budget and Control Board at the end of the fiscal year.  For the purpose of this regulation, foreign travel is defined as any destination outside the continental limits of the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  Other travel is reported by individual as requested by the Office of the Comptroller General.
Airfare
The traveler should make inquiries several weeks before the trip in order to receive the best rates.  If a pre-approved travel agency is used to book the ticket, Accounting must receive an approved travel request with ticket cost and appropriate budget number in order to authorize the charge.  The traveler may do an online purchase and receive reimbursement upon return from the trip.  A receipt showing proof of payment must be indicated on the itinerary for the cost of the ticket.  The traveler may have to return to the website 24 hours later to print a receipt or in some cases, the traveler may receive a receipt via e-mail.  Credit card statements are not valid receipts as indicated on the travel request form.  The traveler may also call Accounts Payable to set up an appointment to purchase the ticket online with the University’s travel card.  The traveler must have an approved travel request with estimated ticket cost and appropriate budget number.
Allowances
Employees traveling on official business of the University may, upon presentation of a paid receipt, be allowed reimbursement for actual expenses incurred for lodging, limited to in-state costs per night of $125.00 and out-of-state costs of similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00 per night.
Employees may also be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred in the obtaining of meals except that such costs shall not exceed $25.00 per day in-state and $32.00 per day out-of-state.
The mileage reimbursements at the rate of 53.5 cents per mile will be made when an employee uses a personal automobile in travelling on University business.  Travel by commercial airlines is encouraged so valuable time will not be spent in slower ground travel.   Total transportation allowance will not exceed tourist airfare.
Special Rules
Reimbursement will be made for meals for trips of a day’s duration or shorter.   Regulations appearing below will apply.  In accordance with Internal Revenue requirements, the appropriate tax form will be generated reflecting such reimbursements.
Receipts for meal and taxi expenditures are not necessary.  Receipts for all other expenditures must be submitted.  The State will not accept cancelled checks or copies of credit card invoices in lieu of receipts.
No reimbursement for overnight accommodation will be made within fifty (50) miles of the traveler’s official headquarters and/or residence.
Registration receipts must accompany travel voucher.
Employees earning frequent flyer premiums while traveling on State business must use them to reduce the cost of subsequent business travel whenever possible.
Method of Determining Maximum Subsistence
This procedure should be used in completing the Travel Request portion of the form prior to departure and the Travel Reimbursement section of the form on returning from trips.
1.  Single Calendar Day-When reimbursements for meals are claimed, the time of arrival and departure as well as the starting point and destination must be shown.  In determining the maximum amount of subsistence for meals which may be reimbursed, the following time schedule will be adhered to:
AMOUNT
PER MEAL
If Departure Time Is:
And If Return Time Is:
In State
Out-of-State
Maximum $32/day
Maximum $50/day
1.  Before 6:30AM
*1.  After 11:00AM
(Breakfast)*2.  After 1:30PM (Lunch)*3.  After 8:30PM (Dinner)

2.  Overnight Travel-When a University employee is traveling in or out of the State on official University business, the following maximum reimbursement for subsistence will apply:
Meals – The cost of meals will be reimbursed up to the maximum amount as provided for in the single calendar day schedule above.  The time limitations for breakfast will not apply for overnight trips.  Time of Departure and Time of Arrival must be indicated for the first and the last day of the trip.
Hotel/Motel – Actual hotel/motel costs will be  reimbursed when a paid original receipt is presented and attached to the travel voucher.  It is expected that persons traveling for Francis Marion University generally will limit in-state hotel/motel costs to $125.00 and out-of-state costs to similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00.  Exceeding these limits will require special justification to be approved by the appropriate Vice President.
Parking – Parking fees for State-owned and privately owned vehicles are reimbursable upon presentation of a paid receipt.
Porterage and Gratuities – Gratuities are not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  When paid as part of a billing for a banquet, luncheon, etc., gratuities will be allowed.  Porterage, in general, is not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  It may be reimbursed when an employee flies to a major city out-of-state where there is no option concerning baggage handling.   Porterage may also be reimbursed when an employee has heavy, excess equipment needed to conduct official University business.
Travel Request forms may be obtained from Accounting.

If student travel is required for a course, the professor must on the first day of class issue to each student in the course a “Field Trip/Off Campus Academic Activities Release Form.”  This form may be attained from each Schools Dean’s office or the Provost’s Office.  Each student who acknowledges this travel requirement and wishes to remain in the course must sign and date the form and write in his/her Social Security number.  The professor must then collect these forms, sign them, and obtain the school dean or department chair’s signature.  Once the forms are complete, all white copies must be forwarded to the Provost’s Office and the yellow copies delivered to the students.
If student travel is associated with any Student Life activity, each student member of the club/organization will be required by the faculty/staff sponsor to complete a “Student Life Travel Release Form” prior to traveling, including a parent/guardian’s signature if the student is under 18 years of age.  This form may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office.  The faculty/staff sponsor must then obtain the signature of either the Assistant Vice President of Student Development or the Vice President for Student Affairs.  Once the forms have been completed, the faculty/staff sponsor must forward all white copies to the Student Affairs Office and the yellow copies to the student.
The responsible faculty or staff member will note on travel request forms that all students traveling have completed an appropriate release form.

Acceptable UseAccess to Francis Marion University’s (FMU) computer systems and network is a privilege and not a right.  As such, access to computer systems and a network owned or operated by FMU imposes certain responsibilities and obligations and is granted subject to university policies, and local, state, and federal laws.
In making acceptable use of FMU resources you are expected to:
Use resources only for authorized purposes.
Protect your user id and system from unauthorized use. You are responsible for all activities on your user id or that originate from your system.
Access only information that is your own, that is publicly available, or to which you have been given authorized access.
Use only legal versions of copyrighted software in compliance with vendor license requirements.
Use only legally obtained versions of sound recordings and movies downloaded from the network or internet.
Be considerate in your use of shared resources. Refrain from monopolizing systems, overloading networks with excessive data, degrading services, or wasting computer time, connect time, disk space, printer paper, manuals, or other resources.
In making acceptable use of resources you are expected NOT to:
Use another person’s system, user id, password, files, or data without permission.
Use computer programs to decode passwords or access control information.
Attempt to circumvent or subvert system or network security measures.
Engage in any activity that might be purposefully harmful to systems or to any information stored thereon, such as creating or propagating viruses, disrupting services, or damaging files or making unauthorized modifications to university data.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Policies
Copying, distributing, and downloading copyrighted materials, including music, videos, and games, for which you do not have the owner’s (copyright holder’s) permission is a violation of federal law. Compliance with federal copyright law is expected of all students, faculty, and staff at FMU. If you download and/or distribute unauthorized copies of copyrighted music recordings and movies, you are breaking the law and may be held legally liable for thousands of dollars in damages. Federal law provides severe penalties for the unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or digital transmission of copyrighted materials. The FBI investigates allegations of criminal copyright infringement and violators are prosecuted.
Most peer-to-peer (P2P) software turns file sharing on by default as soon as the software is installed. This means that others may access materials on your computer without your knowledge, whether you have given permission or not. Downloading copyrighted music or movie files without permission is illegal. It is also illegal to share purchased music or movie files with others, again, whether you are aware that you have done it or not.
If you install P2P software, turn the file sharing options off. And, remember, if you are sharing materials inadvertently, you are still liable for violating copyright law.
WARNING: Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Francis Marion University reserves the right to terminate computing services of users who repeatedly infringe upon the rights of copyright owners. If you have questions about whether you may be infringing on another’s copyright, please review the online Crash Course on Copyright.
Enforcement
The University considers any violation of acceptable use principles or guidelines to be a serious offense and reserves the right to copy and examine any files or information resident on university systems or systems attached to the university network allegedly related to unacceptable use, and to protect its network from systems and events that threaten or degrade operations. Violators are subject to disciplinary action as prescribed in the student handbook. Offenders also may be prosecuted under laws including (but not limited to) the Communications Act of 1934 (amended), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, The Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1989, Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property.
The system administrator will interpret this acceptable use policy, and he/she will attempt to contact users (via electronic mail or in writing) that are behaving inappropriately to discuss and correct their behavior. If a user continues to behave inappropriately, the system administrator may restrict, suspend, or revoke a user’s Internet access without further warning or discussion. A user may appeal the system administrator’s decision to the University’s Chief Information Officer, who will consult with the Vice President for Student Life or Vice President for Administration as appropriate for a decision. Users who have difficulties with others on the Internet (whether they are on campus or off campus) should report those problems to the system manager.
Information Disclaimer
Individuals using computer systems owned by FMU do so subject to applicable laws and University policies. FMU disclaims any responsibility and/or warranties for information and materials residing on non-university systems or available over publicly accessible networks. Such materials do not necessarily reflect the attitudes, opinions, or values of FMU, its faculty, staff, or students. These guidelines should not be construed as a limit on any individual’s right under the Constitution of the United States.
Digital Copyright Compliance
Downloading, copying and sharing material, such as music, movies, games, and applications, for which the copyright holder has not given you rights is both against the law and Francis Marion University’s (FMU) Acceptable Technology Resource Use Policy for computing resources.
Most peer-to-peer (P2P) software turns file sharing on by default as soon as the software is installed. This means that others may access materials on your computer without your knowledge, whether you have given permission or not. Downloading copyrighted music or movie files without permission is illegal. It is also illegal to share purchased music or movie files with others, again, whether you are aware that you have done it or not.
If you install P2P software, turn the file sharing options off. And remember, if you are sharing materials inadvertently, you are still liable for violating copyright law.
The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) also referred to as H.R. 4137, was signed into law on August 14, 2008. The HEOA primarily addresses obstacles that make it difficult for qualified students to obtain a college education, but it also includes specific statements requiring colleges and universities to comply with digital copyright laws.
This law requires us to take the following steps to deter illegal downloading:
Use of one or more technology-based deterrents
An annual disclosure to students describing copyright law and campus policies related to violating copyright law.
A plan to “effectively combat” copyright abuse on the campus network using a “variety of technology-based deterrents”
Provide access to and offer alternatives to illegal downloading
Technology-based Deterrents
FMU uses its firewall as a technology-based deterrent and monitors total Internet usage on a daily basis.  Certain application-level traffic related to P2P is currently monitored and rate-limited to help deter unlawful file sharing and adherence to the Digital Copyright Compliance Policy.
Annual Disclosure
FMU uses the following methods to inform the university community about the law and FMU’s response to copyright infringement claims:
In order to use university technology resources, all members of the FMU Community endorse a Use Agreement that includes a section on copyright compliance.
New student orientation materials will include information to make them aware of legalities associated with peer-to-peer file sharing.
The annual newsletter distributed to FMU students during the early fall will include informational reminders regarding illegal distribution of copyrighted materials. .
Computing support staff, which includes student workers, is made aware of legalities associated with peer to peer file sharing during annual training.
Language is included in the Student Handbook outlining the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Student residence hall assistants are made aware of illegal peer-to-peer policies during annual orientation.
Offer alternatives to illegal file sharing
Legal Sources of Online Content
Copyright Violation Notice
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) actively notifies FMU of individuals on the network who are offering and/or receiving copyrighted movies or music recordings for download through peer to peer applications.
FMU takes these reports very seriously and will take steps to address any infringing activity. Failure to take these actions can potentially result in liability for the University itself. In addition to any University-imposed action, any student using his/her network access privileges to engage in the downloading, uploading, or other unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials is potentially at risk of becoming the target of legal action for copyright infringement. Legal actions in prior years have resulted in thousands of dollars in fines levied against our students.
As outlined in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities in the Student Handbook, there is a judicial process for students violating University policies. These steps can include loss of network access through the residence halls and wireless network among other disciplinary actions deemed appropriate by Student Affairs. Please read your student handbook for more information.
WARNING: Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Francis Marion University reserves the right to terminate computing services of users who repeatedly infringe upon the rights of copyright owners. If you have questions about whether you may be infringing on another’s copyright, please review the online Crash Course on Copyright.
Reviewing Effectiveness
Compared to our peers, FMU receives remarkably few (averaging less than two per year) peer-to-peer file sharing take-down notices. We will continue to monitor these notices to watch for unexpected increases that would require additional measures.

PasswordsYour Active Directory username (i.e. network and email credentials) is tied to a password in order to access the services on campus. It is important that you never share your password with anyone. Passwords are only good for a certain time period, at which point they “expire” and must be changed. This is to reduce the chance of a long lasting password from being used to access our services without authorization.
FMU Active Directory passwords must adhere to the following guidelines:
They must be at least 8 characters in length.
They must include characters and numbers.
They cannot be reproductions of any of your previous 4 passwords.
They have a maximum age of 120 days. (This is the “expiration period”.)
PrintingPay-for-Print
Effective fall 2015, each registered student will be required to used their campus ID card to print in public labs. The University will credit $12.50 per year to each student’s campus ID card to be used for printing. This is equivalent to 250 black and white prints/copies. Once the print credits are used, additional printing will require that students have money on their campus ID card to cover printing costs. Additional funds can be added to the student’s campus ID card for prints/copies at the Cashier’s Office, room 104 in Stokes Administration Building. Unused print credits will be cleared before new print credits are applied each fall semester.
FMU-funded Allocations
Fall Semester:  Each registered student will be issued $12.50 in print credits.
Spring Semester:  Each newly registered student (does not include those who registered in the fall) will be issued a pro-rated $6.25 in print credits.
Summer Semesters:  No print credits will be issued during the summer sessions.
Unused Print Credits:  Will be cleared (zero balance) before applying new funds prior to each fall semester.
Pricing for Prints
Black and white prints/copies are $0.05 each (duplex is two prints or $0.10).
Color prints/copies are $0.35 each (duplex is two prints or $0.70).
Prints/copies will be deducted first from the FMU-provided print credits. Once the FMU-provided print credits are used, printing will be debited from the student’s campus ID card debit balance. Funds can be added to the student’s campus ID card at the Cashier’s Office, room 104 in Stokes Administration Building starting at a minimum of $5.00.
Process for Printing
Printing in FMU’s public computer labs now requires the use of a student campus ID card. The first time the campus ID card is used, the student will be required to “link” their campus ID card with their FMU network (Gmail) credentials. This is done when a student prints in a public computer lab for the first time by tapping the campus ID card on the card reader attached to the printer/copier and then entering their network (Gmail) username and password. Once this is done, the student only needs to print to the “follow me printer” queue and then tap their campus ID card at one of the printers located in the one of the public computer labs (i.e. Rogers Library, Cauthen Educational Media Center, Stanton Academic Computer Center) to complete their print request. Students must have enough funds to cover the queued print job on the student’s campus ID card before completing the print request.

Printing Policy
For computer lab users in the Library and the Media Center and all facilities of Campus Technology:
Networked laser printers are provided to the University community for the pursuit of professional and scholarly endeavors.
If you are involved with a business which requires printing, please find another way to do your printing. Commercial use of printing resources is simply not allowed.
If your University department or student organization needs to print, please be reminded that the University has already provided you with a budget for this as well as a print shop if your needs are extensive. (For example, instructors requiring students to make multiple copies of materials for class distribution should seek departmental assistance with this instructional expense.) University departments and organizations should use their own printing resources.
Distance Education - Student Privacy and Student AuthenticationFrancis Marion University complies with the SACS Commission on Colleges’ distance education policies. These policies include procedures to protect student privacy and to ensure student authentication. Each student in a distance education course is assigned a login and password and must use this login and password to access and participate in the distance education course. For security reasons, this specific course and student information is not available to any outside users.
All Francis Marion students, including those enrolled in online, hybrid, or other distance education classes, are informed of the FMU honor code, standards of academic conduct, and standards of student behavior. Students enrolled in online, hybrid, or distance education courses must adhere to policies on electronic security that prohibit sharing of passwords and require students and faculty to prevent non-authorized persons from gaining access to their University computer accounts.
Faculty engaged in distance education actively seek to ensure the integrity and security of distance education instruction. The University encourages additional means of authentication and student privacy in distance education courses as new options become available.
No additional costs are associated with the authentication of student identity at Francis Marion University.

Use of the Patriot Card as a Debit Card:

By-Laws
FundraisingThe Development Office assists with the coordination of all campus fundraising efforts (except those involving student organizations).  The Development Office organizes, plans, and carries out annual fundraising campaigns for the Annual Fund, the Swamp Fox Club and special projects.  The Development Office identifies prospects and works with donors who wish to make restricted and unrestricted gifts to the University.   The office prepares proposals to solicit major gifts from individuals, foundations, businesses, industry, and other community/civic organizations.
All gifts of cash are received in the Development Office which is also responsible for receipting funds appropriately and acknowledging and reporting gifts.  Non-Cash Gifts are also recorded in the Development Office.  A Non-Cash Gifts Form is used for reporting such gifts.  This form may be obtained in the Development Office.  The office maintains records of donor activities and plans special events to cultivate and recognize donor generosity.
Any academic or administrative department or division which plans to solicit funds from the private sector should coordinate such activities through the Development Office.
Non-Cash GiftsThe Development Office records, receipts, and acknowledges all gifts to Francis Marion University or the FMU Foundation. Donors may designate their gifts to either Francis Marion University or the FMU Foundation. The Development Office has in place mechanisms to direct gifts and gift income as required by the University and/or the donor. Donors wishing to give to the University should contact Development Office directly at (843) 661-1295.
It is important to recognize that gifts classified as equipment, supplies, construction, architectural services, engineering services, or other services or in-kind contributions may require that we obtain prior approval from the State Budget and Control Board Office of General Services. Therefore, no commitment should be made to a donor in advance of all necessary approvals.
Gifts of real estate, personal property, equipment and other in-kind items will be assessed at fair market value. Documentation of gifts at fair market value must be provided to comply with IRS rules and guidelines and to insure accurate records and asset control. The donor should furnish the fair market value of a non-cash gift. For gifts valued at $5,000 or higher a written certification by a qualified appraiser may be required in accordance with IRS regulations (Form 8283). This form may be obtained from the Development Office. It is the donor’s responsibility to obtain the gift appraisal.
The Non-Cash Gifts form should be used to report non-cash gifts to the University or the FMU Foundation. Information should be collected to comply with IRS regulations and properly recognize those individuals making the gift. The form should be completed by the individual or department anticipating the gift, and properly routed and signed prior to gift acceptance. It is required that the gift not be contingent upon any conditions, whether by gratis advertising, monetary, or any form of financial gain to the donor.
For certain gifts, it may be necessary to consult with the Director of the Physical Plant to insure that all requirements can be met prior to accepting the gift:
gifts that require permanent connection to the building or to any building service (electricity, water supply or drain, ventilation, gas, air, steam)
gifts that require the addition or extension of any building service, including electricity at a different voltage or increase in power available
gifts that require special cabinetry, support, or housing not acquired as part of the equipment
gifts that require special environmental conditions
gifts that are particularly large or heavy
gifts that require any cutting, patching, or building modification
Actions required for completing the process:
The individual/department potentially accepting the gift contacts the Development Office and completes the Non-Cash Gift Form.
The completed form is forwarded to the Provost or appropriate Vice President.
All forms are then routed and reviewed by the Vice President for Business Affairs.
The Vice President for Business Affairs forwards the form to the Director of Purchasing to obtain Office of General Services approval if required.
The Director of Purchasing routes the form to the Development Office after Office of General Services approval.
The Development Office records and acknowledges the gift to the donor and forwards the form to the Accounting Office and a copy to the department accepting the gift.
The Accounting Office records the gift and notifies appropriate offices/departments if further action is needed.  (Example: notifying departments responsible for asset control and insurance.)

Swamp Fox ClubGeneral Information
The Swamp Fox Club, formerly the Patriots Brigade, is the official booster club that generates support for the Francis Marion University Athletic Department.  Renaming this organization honors the Swamp Fox himself – General Francis Marion, the Revolutionary War hero who outfoxed the British to help America win its independence and for whom the University is named.
On an annual basis, more than 175 student-athletes receive some scholarship assistance from the Swamp Fox Club.  The athletic booster club has developed into a vitally important support group for the Athletic Department, pursuing the excellence, integrity and pride in the University’s athletic program.
Vision for the Future
The Swamp Fox Club plays a vital role in Patriot Athletics’ continued success.  As educational expenses continue to rise, it will become increasingly more difficult to achieve academic and athletic excellence.  These dramatic increases make reliance on private support a must in providing financial assistance for our student-athletes.
Planned Gifts
You can make a substantial contribution to the Patriot Athletic Scholarship Fund through gifts in trust, charitable annuities, endowed scholarships, life insurance policies, and bequests.  Many of these options provide significant tax savings, as well as rates of return significantly higher than traditional investments.  For more information on planned giving to Francis Marion University Athletics, please contact our office at (843) 661-1240.
Methods of Contribution
Each year alumni and friends of Francis Marion University make a variety of gifts in support of athletic and academic excellence.  Each contributor can elect to make a gift in a way that best suits his or her personal preference.  Gifts made to the Swamp Fox Club are tax deductible.
Cash and Other Gifts
Cash is the most common form of giving.  Contributions provide the yearly financial resources necessary to operate our athletic program.  Some contributors may elect to give stock, securities, real estate or life insurance policies.
Matching Gifts
This method goes hand-in-hand with cash gifts.  If your company is a participant in a matching gift program, you receive credit in the Swamp Fox Club for the total contribution – a great way to double or triple the impact of your gift and increase your membership level and its privileges!  See your personnel officer for complete information on matching gifts.
Planned and Estate Gifts
Contributors can make life income arrangements and donate monies using trusts, gift annuities, pooled income funds, etc. Individuals can choose to make provisions in their estates for the support of our athletic program, using a variety of gift vehicles. These gifts can provide present and future support for Francis Marion University athletics and can offer you valuable tax advantages and income benefits.
Tax Implications
All contributions to the Swamp Fox Club for the Athletic Scholarship Fund are deductible for tax purposes. These gifts are credited for full value for purposes of gift record at the university. However, in order to comply with IRS laws concerning charitable contributions, the value of any benefits received must be subtracted from the amount of the gift. If you wish to claim a deduction for your entire gift amount, you may elect not to accept the benefits your gift entitles you to receive. If this is your wish, please indicate on the membership form. If so requested, benefits will not be provided and the full donation will be considered deductible. The Athletic Department has estimated the fair market value of the benefits described in the SFC brochure, and that information is available upon request.
Corporate Sponsorship
The Francis Marion University Athletic Department offers a variety of corporate sponsorship opportunities, which provide first-rate and high profile advertising. Your business can gain wide recognition and broad distribution through signage and printed materials. For more information on how you can reach the clients of tomorrow today, click on the below links and contact the Francis Marion Athletic Department (843-661-1240) to customize a package that will fit your business needs and goals.

Grants and ResearchConcept Approval Form
As soon as you have decided to undertake a grant, you need to fill out the Concept Approval form for the grant. The form provides the University with core information regarding your proposed activity. It also provides everyone with documentation that this activity was discussed and was approved, at least at the conceptual level.
After filling out the details on the form, have your Department Chair sign it. Your Department Chair passes it onto the next administrator on the list for approval. At any point in this process, discussions may occur to further clarify what will be entailed in the proposed activity. Once the President has signed the form, it is sent to Shara Moore in Business Affairs with a copy also residing in the Provost’s Office.
General Information on Grants at FMU
How the Grants Development Program can assist you:
The Grants Development Program works with campus members to prepare grant proposals to external funding agencies. In doing so, the Grants Development Program also works closely with the Office of Financial Services, Human Resources, Accounting, the University Foundation, and the Office of the Provost. Faculty are encouraged to meet with the Director of the Grants Development Program to acquaint the office with their current and anticipated interests. Doing so enables the office to add that information to search criteria so that campus community members can be notified of funding sources and opportunities that may support their project interests. As soon as a faculty member plans to pursue a particular funding source, they are asked to complete a Grant Concept Approval form to obtain requisite permissions from their Department Chair, Dean, Provost and the President of the University.  The form is available on-line at this site in word processing formats for both Macs and PCs.
Reasons to consider doing a grant
Grants provide faculty with some amazing opportunities. This is your chance to turn ideas into reality – whether to carry out a research project or to demonstrate a new way of doing something. Many grants provide faculty with a way to build in additional professional development, equipment, materials, and travel. They provide a rich environment to gather data for peer-reviewed articles. Most importantly, they are a key scholarly activity that enhances your overall development as an academic.
An article you may want to look at was written by Kenneth Henson of the Citadel, a specialist in grants at the post-secondary level. He has done a nice job of providing some insights into the grants process for faculty members.
Steps in doing the grant
Have a passion to do something.
Find a funding source that is compatible with your idea.
Complete the Concept Approval Form and submit it to your Department Chair or Dean who then moves it up the list of people.
Begin mapping out the overall grant. You might brainstorm ideas with fellow faculty or you may be setting up meetings with partner groups to get their input and direction.
With a better idea of what will happen in the grant, talk with the Director of Grants Development (Jane Madden, 1230) or the Director of Financial Planning (Shara Moore, 1132) to see if there are some points you should be checking. For example, does your proposal need to be submitted to an IRB review for Human Subject Research? Do you need to check with the Physical Plant on alterations to facilities? Calling or meeting with the Director of Grants Development will be a quick way to find a partner to help you sort through the issues.
Work diligently on writing the grant. Have friends lined up who are willing to read and see if it makes sense. Does it fit together? Does it sound doable? They could also check it for spelling and grammar.
Begin working on the budget section and share with Shara Moore, the Director of Financial Planning so she can spot problems early on.
Complete the entire grant and submit it to the Provost’s Office for a preliminary review. He may ask the Director of Grants Development and the Director of Financial Planning to look it over at this time.
Take the feedback from the various groups that have reviewed the document and incorporate the appropriate changes. Seven working days (not including weekends) ahead of the deadline for the grant leaving campus, submit the grant to the Provost’s Office for a final review. Again, the Director of Grants Development and the Director of Financial Planning will usually be involved in the process.
When everything looks good, submit it online or make copies and send it off. Then, breathe a sigh of relief that it made it out the door on time.
Why the University must sign-off on the grant
Despite the hours we may put in on a grant, it really isn’t ours. A grant is normally a contract between the funding agency and the University. The University has the responsibility to be sure that whatever efforts take place on the campus, or through the campus, are consistent with the mandate of the University and abides by all the regulations governing the University. That last part is very significant. The rules and regulations governing the University are many and varied. Fortunately, each administrative department is quite cooperative in helping to decipher what those are and how they impact your grant efforts.
Foundation vs. University
On occasion, you will come across funding opportunities through private foundations. If it is a situation where the funding agency (the private foundation) can only give the funds to another non-profit agency such as the University Foundation, then you must gain permission from the Foundation before applying. There is a separate form for applications that must go through the Foundation. The reason for seeking approval for the Foundation is that it must practice due diligence in reviewing the activities in which it will engage to be sure they fit within the guidelines established for its operation. Again, even though you may be the one carrying out the activities in a successful grant application, it is technically the Foundation (in this scenario) that is receiving the funds.
GrantStation Information
Several departments on campus are using the GrantStation website to locate alternative funding sources for projects. Please remember to sign-in (login) to the GrantStation website so that you can have maximum access to all of the resources that are available. Individuals who do not have a password for the site are not able to get to the full-range of options that are there for members. If you forget your user name and password, please give Jane a call at Ext. 1230 or e-mail hmadden@fmarion.edu We held several workshops on campus to orient people to the GrantStation site. If you were unable to attend, please feel free to call Jane and she’ll give you an orientation over the phone or one-on-one. She has also developed a handout for the GrantStation site to help new users.
Grant Deadlines
You will find that you will read the guidelines for a grant several times, if not more! Keep an eye on the deadline date. This can be tricky. Check for the following:
A. The grant RFP says that the grant must be received by a particular time and date. Remember – all your work will be for nothing if it is not received on time. If 5:00 p.m. is the cutoff, then 5:01 p.m. is too late.
Don’t assume because you sent it via the post office that the funding agency will still accept it if it shows up a day late. Many agencies will tell you that if you send it via the postal service, you’ll have to have a postmark on your package that must be 5 working days (not including weekends) in advance of the deadline. Keep a receipt for your package that you can use to argue your case in the event the parcel does arrive late. You’ll need it.
The State does have a free courier service that runs between state agencies. Unfortunately, it can’t guarantee that a package will get into Columbia on time. In that situation, a date stamp doesn’t do a thing for you according to one of the state agencies with whom we dealt. Get behind on your project or run into last minute difficulties and you’ll find yourself dashing to Columbia with the package in hand. Don’t worry – you won’t be the first person to do it and you won’t be the last.
The University does have a regular commercial courier pickup on campus. Call the Warehouse to arrange a time early in the day. Normally, someone will be around to pick up your package by 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon. If you’re not going to be ready until later in the day, get your label with the proper account number on it and then drop it off yourself in town at the correct courier depot on your way home. Talk to your department to get one of the labels filled out and ready to go.
B. The grant RFP says the grant must be sent by a particular time and date. In this scenario, you feel like you’ve got a little bit more breathing room. In reality, you don’t. A lot of federal agencies seem to be encouraging people to use commercial courier services over the post office because of the security issues in place for handling postal packages. There can be significant delays for items travelling through the regular mail service due to the security precautions at the other end.
Electronic Submissions of Grant Applications
In this scenario, the grant RFP says you must submit the grant electronically by a certain time and date through an online portal. NSF has been using this for quite a while. The federal department of education has also started the move to online submissions. Their system is actually quite user friendly compared to NSF.
The NSF uses something called “FastLane.”
How to use FastLane: https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/a0/about/using.htm
For details on how to use the Department of Education’s online submission portal, check out:
How to use the e-Application process in the federal Department of Education
https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships
Concerns you should have over electronic submissions:
Apart from the usual nightmares that you have left it until the last minute and are now concerned that the entire University network will go down, you have to be very concerned about the authorization process and the time lines associated with that process. Electronic submissions are actually a multi-step procedure.
Once you get all of your bits and pieces uploaded, the system sends a message to the authorized representative for the University who must electronically sign your document to authorize it to go forward to the competition. Without that step, your proposal is going nowhere. For electronic submissions, the Provost’s Office has been the authorized representative. NSF provides a breathing space between your submission of the proposal and the authorized university representative signing it. This allows for anomalies such as submissions that occur late at night or for a situation when a person could be out of town. Note that the federal department of education does not do that. If your submission is to be in no later than midnight on a particular date, then once you submit your proposal, the authorized representative must also electronically sign your proposal before that midnight hour. Of course, if you’ve got the proposal in early, that won’t be a problem. On the other hand, if you are indeed submitting it at the very last minute possible, and it will be happening well after work hours, you could have some excitement.
Getting a focus for your grant efforts
Many people approach grants with a shopping list of things they want rather than with an outcome in mind. The “shopping list” approach can result in a lot of stress because you end up twisting yourself out of shape to try and get it to fit the objectives of the funding source. Without a logical outcome, trying to set up coherent arguments that justify the “shopping list” gets very tricky.
The easy way to begin your process is by playing the “So what?” game with yourself. Simply state your case in a sentence or two as to why you need this money. Next, if you can find a volunteer to assist you with this process, read aloud your statement and get them to say “So what?” Now, try and answer that question. Each time you come up with an answer, have them challenge you by saying, “So what?” Eventually, you’ll either discover you’ve been heading in the wrong direction or you’ll find that you have hit on the heart of the matter and are ready to put everything else into place. Play “So what?” by yourself or with a partner – it’s a little exercise that can save you a lot of time.
Salary-related issue for grants
A large number of grants provide faculty with the opportunity to buy out their time from the University or to arrange to receive additional hours – both during the year and especially in the spring and summer months. The State does not allow faculty to earn more than their regular hourly wage. Nor can faculty earn more than a particular percentage over their regular salary during the course of the year. Therefore, it is important that you get accurate figures to use in your budget section. Human Resources can supply you with the necessary information. The person to contact there is Danagene Razick (661-1142).
When it comes to including the cost of your time in a proposal, you have to remember that your salary consists of both wages and fringe benefits. Those fringe benefits can cost up to an additional 35% (and as health costs continue to increase, that number may also increase). The University pays for a large percentage of our benefits. Remember, we still have to pay our own portion of retirement, social security, and taxes, and any other applicable deductions on top of that.
So why worry about salary and fringes when doing a grant budget? Consider the following examples:
The budget shows one flat rate for the faculty member, $1,000. In real terms, that means the check they receive from their work might show a total of anywhere from $650 to $825. (Everything is dependent upon your individual deductions as well as the employer fringes.) That’s what they can put in the bank. The institution had to deduct the benefits portion from the grant funds as the grant was picking up the faculty member’s time. It also had to deduct those items we are personally responsible for. Occasionally, a grant might be set up such that the grant picks up the wages for the faculty member and the institution picks up the fringe benefits. All of those things have to be negotiated prior to the grant being submitted.
In our second example, the grant budget is set up to cover both the salary at $1,000 and a calculated estimate of the fringe benefits on top of that. Apart from the individual deductions such as social security, retirement, and taxes, the amount on the check that goes in the bank will be much higher than in our first example.
Any money over your regular salary will not have health and dental deducted.
If your intention is to receive additional funds from another state agency or a grant during the time you are under contract with the University, it is imperative that you meet with Human Resources to be sure you are within the State regulated guidelines.
An important exception you should know about . . . .
In the beginning, I naively assumed that all PreK-12 schools and Universities were state agencies. PreK-12 schools are not considered state agencies. Therefore, in a situation where a school is the fiscal agent (they get the money directly from the funding agency and handle the bills) for the grant and they’ve retained your services, then the salary you receive from them is not counted towards your annual total, nor is it subject to the hourly wage limitations. In other words, it is as if it didn’t even happen! However, if they buy your services from the University and you receive your check from the University, then it does count towards the annual total limitations and the hourly wage limitations. Always, make sure that your time commitments do not interfere or conflict with your scheduled teaching and office hours. Clear any such arrangements with your department chair. Watch how you set it up and always double-check on regulations as they change!
DUNS, TNS, EIN Numbers
On all federal grant applications, you will come across a request on the cover sheet for a DUNS identification number. Recent application forms are also calling for the TNS number. Shara Moore, Jane Madden, and Cathy Shwartz all have those numbers or can find out for you.
See Financial Services Policy on Grants for more information.

Housing, Dining, and Residence LifeGeneral PoliciesTrash Disposal
Residents are expected to remove garbage and other trash from their rooms and apartments on a regular basis. For convenience, large trash dumpsters are located throughout the area. Trash should not be left on balconies, in hallways, or other areas of the residential facilities. Recycling receptacles have been placed throughout housing areas. A $25 trash fee will be charged if a resident leaves trash outside their apartment or hall room. The fee will be divided evenly between all residents that live in the apartment or residence hall at that time unless ownership can be determined.
Weapons/Firearms/Fireworks
Possession or use of any type of firearm, fireworks, or other weapons by anyone on University-owned or -controlled property is prohibited. Instruments used to simulate such weapons in acts that endanger or tend to endanger any person shall be considered a weapon. Involvement in this activity will result in removal from the residential facilities on a permanent basis and could result in other sanctions such as suspension or expulsion (see Code of Student Conduct section of the FMU Student Handbook). For more information regarding weapons on campus, please see Campus Police and the Student Rights and Responsibilities sections of the FMU Student Handbook.
Pets
For health and safety reasons, students and their guests are prohibited from possessing pets in and around the residence halls and student apartments. Students found with a pet or animal will be required to remove the pet immediately and will be subject to disciplinary action. Additionally, the student will be assessed for any pest control or cleaning costs.
Solicitation
Distribution of written materials and solicitation by students, University employees, nonaffiliated individuals, and nonaffiliated groups are prohibited in student housing. Canvassing, selling, offering for sale, soliciting, or promoting the sale of any goods or services is prohibited on University premises, including residence halls and apartments, except as allowed under University policy (see Solicitation Policy in Rights and Responsibilities section). However, an individual student has the right to invite anyone into his or her residence hall living quarters for the purposes of that student considering or purchasing the invitee’s goods or services. Students are not allowed to conduct commercial activities or business ventures from their rooms or apartments.
Written materials designed for commercial purposes may not be distributed on University premises, including residence halls and apartments. Before any material is posted, it must be approved through the Offices of Housing and Residence Life or Student Affairs (see Literature Distribution and Posting Policy).
Sports and Use of Sports Equipment
Use of outdoor sporting equipment such as balls, Frisbees, golf clubs, bats, skateboards, lacrosse sticks, etc. inside of the residence halls and apartments is prohibited. Use of such equipment indoors poses a threat to the physical safety of residents and can result in damage to University or individual property or bodily harm as well as creating noise problems. Use of such equipment is restricted to appropriate locations outside of the residence halls and apartments.
Windows/Balconies
Throwing objects from windows, balconies, etc., is a danger to students outside of the building and is therefore prohibited. Hanging outside or climbing from windows is also prohibited due to the danger involved. Screens must remain in windows at all times.
Community StandardsWhat are community standards?
Everyone in the community must respect the rights of others and make choices to maintain a safe and secure environment that allows all residents to pursue their academic goals. There are also some standards in the form of established policies that have been set forth for which you will be accountable. These include, but are not limited to, University Housing and Residence Life Policies, the Code of Student Conduct, and the University Alcohol and Drug Policy. These policies can be found in the FMU Student Handbook and other university publications.
What happens when standards are not met or a policy is violated?
Ideally, all members of the community encourage one another to live by the standards and policies set forth. However, when infractions occur, individuals must take responsibility for their choices. A disciplinary process exists by which individuals are held accountable for their choices and actions that violate policies. Typically, RAs become initially involved in responding to policy violations. The RA then makes a report to the Assistant Director of Housing and Residence Life, who determines what actions should be taken (which may include referral to the Office of Student Affairs – see Code of Student Conduct). When an RA or other university official, confronts a possible violation of university policy, everyone involved is expected to comply with their requests. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action.
Guest VisitationEach guest must have some form of positive identification with proof of age. Guests must be 18 years old or older in order to visit the residence halls and student apartments. When visiting, the guest must be escorted by the host resident at all times. When accompanied by parents or responsible relatives, those under 18 may visit for a short period of time during established visitation hours. Guests should not be left in the building while the resident is not present. Residents are responsible for the actions of their guests. Violations of this policy by residents will result in disciplinary actions, which could include loss of visitation privileges. Nonresidents who violate any part of this policy may be banned from the residential facilities or campus. Please note that due to liability reasons, babysitting is not allowed.
Overnight-Stay  Visitation
Overnight stay is defined as a single guest, per resident, staying overnight between the hours of 12 midnight and 6 a.m.
Overnight guests MUST be acceptable to all roommates, suite-mates, and/or apartment-mates; anyone with whom you share a living space.
Residents must establish visitation expectations in advance, in writing, through the Roommate Agreement Form (contact housing staff for form).
Overnight guests are required to register their vehicles and display a temporary parking permit as noted on the Overnight Guest Visitation form (contact housing for form). Please note that ALL residents of a room or an apartment must sign the Overnight Guest Visitation form.
A resident may have no more than six overnight-stay guests total, per semester, and no more than two consecutive overnight-stays.
Same Gender Guest Visitation
Residential students may visit other residential students of the same gender at any time. Non-residential students must adhere to the same visitation hours that apply to opposite gender visitation unless they have registered as an overnight guest. Residents may have overnight guests of the same gender with written approval from the Resident Assistant or Housing and Residence Life Office staff. Overnight Guest Visitation Forms are available from the Housing and Residence Life Office during business hours or from a Resident Assistant when the office is closed. Overnight guests are required to register their vehicles and display a temporary parking permit as noted on the Overnight Guest Visitation Form. Please note that all residents of a room or apartment must sign the Overnight Guest Visitation Form.
NoiseBecause of the nature of high-density living on a college campus, it is important that the rights and responsibilities of all residents are both respected and protected. One right all students have is to live in an environment that is conducive to the educational nature of Francis Marion University. In order to respect the rights of others, it is expected that students will not create excessive amounts of noise in the residential areas of campus. If noise of any type is loud enough to potentially disturb others, it is unacceptable. Exceptions to this policy can be made by the office of the Dean of Students or the Office of Housing and Residence Life for pre-approved activities by recognized students or campus organizations.
While not all-inclusive, following is a list of examples of what might generate unacceptable levels of noise.
Playing stereo loud enough to be heard outside of your room or apartment.
Screaming, yelling, or making other verbal noise that can disturb others.
Large groups of people gathered in public places near residence halls (e.g. octagon or triangle, etc.) or apartments (e.g. community center, picnic areas, etc.) talking loudly or playing music.
Car stereos loud enough to be heard outside of the vehicle.
Running, jumping, dancing, or other activity that can be heard in other parts of the building.
Televisions, video games, or other devices loud enough to be heard outside of the room.
Banging or knocking on doors in a manner that others may be disturbed.
In all residence halls and apartments, 24 hour “courtesy hours” are in effect with regard to noise. This means that at all times, residents must be aware and courteous regarding the noise level and how their noise may impact on others’ ability to study, sleep, read, visit, etc.
Parking for Resident Students and GuestsPerimeter parking is available. Access roads within the apartment areas will be open while students are moving in and out of the apartments at the beginning and end of the semester. Residence Hall gates will not be opened.
Loading and Unloading on Access Roads
Park vehicle with two wheels on the same side on the grass to allow other vehicles to pass.
Maximum parking is 20 minutes.
Parking is prohibited on access roads from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Vehicles may not be parked on sidewalks or other grassy areas.
Resident and Guest Parking
Residents must purchase and display the FMU decal (indicated by the letter “R”). Between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., parking is restricted to the appropriate decal for off-campus students.
Temporary permits (A section on the Guest Visitation Form) may be obtained for visitors from the Housing and Residence Life Office or your Resident Assistant if proper approval is obtained.
Parking for the Study Hall is available 24 hours daily. Parking during the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. for off-campus students, faculty, staff and visitors must be coordinated through Campus Police. For more information, refer to the Campus Police and Parking sections of the FMU Student Handbook.

Creating conditions or being involved in behavior that endangers or potentially endangers the safety and well being of self or others.
Housing and Dining RefundsThe Housing and Dining Refund Policy is separate and apart from the Academic Refund Policy and follows different procedures than the Academic Refund Policy due to the unique business of providing food and housing services to students.
Students who withdraw from on-campus housing during the period between the authorized move-in date through 14 calendar days into the fall and spring semesters will receive a 90% refund of the housing fee, less the $150 Housing application/reservation fee. The 90% refund period begins on the authorized move-in date and continues through 14 calendar days into the fall and spring semester. During this period, students with a mandatory meal plan that withdraw from the residence halls or move from the residence halls to the apartments will receive a 90% refund of the meal plan assessment. All other students who wish to change or withdraw from a voluntary meal plan during this period may request a refund by completing and submitting the Dining Services Refund Request form (available at the Ervin Dining Hall). This policy does not apply to any declining balance accounts.
After the 90% refund period, there is no guaranteed refund of housing and meal plan fees. However, appeals will be considered for situations such as marriage, activation for military service, or uniquely extenuating circumstances that occur during the term of the contract. Appeals must be made within the academic semester that the appeal is based upon and should be submitted as soon as possible after the change of status occurs.
All appeals require completion of the Housing and/or Dining Refunds – Appeal Form, which must be submitted to the Director of Housing and/or the Director of Dining Services who will forward the request to the Housing and Dining Refund Committee. Students will be notified in writing of the committee’s decision. The Housing application/reservation fee of $150 will be deducted from all refunds with the exception of academic dismissal and military activation. The decision of the Housing and Dining Refund Committee is final.

InventoryInventory ControlProperty to be Inventoried
Items to be inventoried include moveable equipment costing $5,000.00 or more and having a life expectancy of more than one year.  Specific designation of each item of equipment to be inventoried will be made by Office of Business Affairs – Purchasing when equipment is procured.
Departmental Responsibility
Each department head is responsible for properly securing and keeping track of all supplies or equipment assigned to the department, whether included on inventory listings or not.  Significant relocation or change in possession of inventoried equipment should be reported to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management as soon as it occurs by use of Authorization to Move form.  Authorization to Move forms may be obtained from the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management.  Equipment may be transferred from department to department only upon approval by the head of the donating department or appropriate Vice President.  Equipment may be disposed of only upon approval of the appropriate Vice President (see procedure below).
Semi-annually (or more often, in conjunction with the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management in the case of certain departments or certain classes of equipment) each department will physically verify the presence of or otherwise account for all equipment assigned to the department as reflected on inventory listings which will be furnished by the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management.
Procurement of Property
Property may be procured in several ways. In each case, appropriate steps should be taken to bring the property under control.
Purchases – See normal purchasing procedures. The Office of Business Affairs – Purchasing will designate property to be inventoried, consulting with the department requisitioning the articles if appropriate.
Gifts – see the Policies & Procedures Guide’s Development section: Fundraising Policies and Procedures
Fabrications – Any department constructing inventoriable equipment from parts or materials should report constructed items to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management, which will take appropriate steps to inventory applicable items. This does not apply to assemblies of a temporary nature.
Discoveries – Any department discovering items which apparently should be but are not inventoried, as evidenced by lack of inventory tag, should report them to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management, who will take appropriate steps to inventory applicable items.  Items so discovered during the semi-annual physical verification of the inventory may be reported as provided in the instructions accompanying the inventory listing.
Disposal of Property
To have an item of inventoried equipment removed from the inventory, the department should complete the Property Disposal Request. This form must be signed by the Department Head and approved by the appropriate Vice President. It will then be forwarded to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management for appropriate action. If the property involved is missing, a separate report must be made to the Public Safety Department. The property in question should not be disposed of until disposal is approved. Physical disposition of articles will be handled by the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management. Property Disposal Request or Loss Report forms may be obtained from the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management.
Facilities Management Inventory Control
Equipment that is considered “excess or surplus” will be staged in the warehouse until the equipment is identified as “surplus or trash,” as instructed by the State of South Carolina representative.
Equipment marked “surplus” will remain in the warehouse until the State of South Carolina picks up the surplus equipment and moves it to a staging location.
The Director of Facilities Management or his designee will be responsible for disposal of all items that are define as “trash.”
Surplus items defined as “trash” will be removed by the warehouse personnel and disposed of in the trash dumpster, located on the property of the University.
All scrap metal items will be staged in the scrap metal yard, until sufficient metal has been accumulated initiating the need for a sale.
The Warehouse Manager, under the approval of the Director of Facilities Manager, will conduct the sale of all “scrap” metal and be responsible for documenting the proceeds and handling the disbursement of those proceeds to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management.
Documentation of all “scrap metal” sales will be recorded and filed in the warehouse.
All “surplus” and “trash” items are considered property of the State of South Carolina and can not be given to any employees.
Employees must not tamper with or remove any items that are considered “surplus” or “trash” from the premises. This includes any items that may be trashed and remains in the trash dump until pickup by the contractor.
Progressive Discipline (Offense or Job Deficiency)Failure to follow these guidelines, as stated above will result in disciplinary actions as stated in the Progressive Discipline Policy. Under the Guide for Disciplinary Actions, the offense will be consistent with the other policies relating to Stealing and the Willful Violation of Written Rules, Regulations, and Policies. The policy is defined in the Human Resources Section under Inventory Control Procedures.
Items Susceptible to TheftProperty Susceptible to Theft
Items designated as susceptible to theft are items costing less than $5,000.00 which include, but are not limited to the following:
Personal computers
Printers
Televisions
VCRs
FAX machines
Miscellaneous items determined as such by the Department Head or at the request of the using department
Items designated as susceptible to theft valued from $1,500.00 to $5,000.00 will be placed on an inventory maintained separately from the inventory for moveable equipment costing $5,000.00 or greater. Specific designation of items to be inventoried will be made by the Office of Business Affairs – Purchasing when the item is procured, and notify the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management on a monthly basis.
A listing of the designated items will be provided annually to the departments for verification.
Departmental Responsibility
Each Department Head is responsible for properly securing and keeping track of all supplies or equipment assigned to the department, whether included on an inventory listing or not and regardless of value. Each Department Head is to review and determine miscellaneous items to be included in the inventory listing of items susceptible to theft. The Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management is to be informed by the Department Head of any determinations. The Department Head and/or designated staff member will be responsible for the maintenance of the listings.
Annually the department will be provided an inventory listing of items susceptible to theft. The Department Head or designee shall verify status, and record identifying numbers or attributes that will allow identification. Items not appearing on the listing are to be added with a current status as part of the verification process. The Department Head shall forward the verified listing including all updates to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management, to be centrally maintained for subsequent review and verification. Each department is to provide a written statement of the control procedures (i.e., security of premises, storage, observation) used by the department to safeguard assets. That statement should also be submitted to Telecommunications and Asset Management, and should be updated in the event modifications occur.
Relocation or Change in Possession
Significant relocation or change in possession of inventoried items should be reported to the Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management as soon as the change occurs. E-mail Asset Management to document the move. Items may be transferred from department to department only upon approval by the head of the donating department or appropriate Vice President. A copy of the e-mail is to be maintained by the donating department.
Disposal of Property
To have an inventoried item removed from the inventory, the department should contact Asset Management. If property involved is missing, a separate report must be made to the Public Safety Department. The property in question should not be disposed of until disposal is approved. A copy of the e-mail is to be maintained by the department. The Office of Telecommunications and Asset Management will handle physical disposition of articles.
Failure to follow these guidelines, as stated above will result in disciplinary actions as stated in the Progressive Discipline Policy. Under the Guide for Disciplinary Actions, the offense will be consistent with the other policies relating to Stealing and the Willful Violation of Written Rules, Regulations, and Policies. The policy is defined in the Human Resources Section under Inventory Control Procedures.
LibraryLibrary Policies PagePrivacy Policy
Francis Marion University (“FMU” or “the university”) provides this Web site (“site”) as a service to students, faculty, alumni, and prospective students.  Use of the site is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in FMU’s Privacy Policy (“policy”).
Although FMU respects the privacy of this site’s users (or “members” or “visitors”), the university collects information from its Web site members and visitors.  The Privacy Policy governs users’ interaction with the site and users’ registration for and use of the site’s online services.  Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy, the site’s Terms of Service agreement, and/or other published guidelines, FMU does not release personally identifiable information about the site’s visitors without their permission.
Please note that FMU reviews these privacy practices from time to time, and that these practices are therefore subject to change.  FMU asks users to periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of the site’s Privacy Policy.  To contact FMU about privacy issues, to report a violation of the site’s Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue regarding the site, please send an e-mail to webmaster@fmarion.edu.
The Information FMU Gathers
FMU gathers two types of information about the site’s users:
Non-personally identifiable information.  As users access the site, FMU collects and aggregates information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were employed.  Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system, and browser software used by each visitor.  Although such information is not personally identifiable, the university can determine from the IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of the user’s point of connectivity.The non-personally identifiable information collected helps in diagnosing any server problems, administering the site, identifying the most popular areas of the site, and determining the effectiveness of promotional activities.For the same purposes, the university uses “cookies” – that is, small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive – to help determine the type of content and sites visited, the length of time spent on a particular site, and the usage of services offered via the site.  For information on how users can control their Web browser’s acceptance of cookies, please refer to the documentation accompanying the browser.
Personally identifiable information.  Certain areas of the site may require that users provide personally identifiable information (including, for example, zip code, age, income, and e-mail address).  In addition, when registering to set up an account to use certain services on the site such as e-mail, chat rooms, forums, or to receive newsletters or specifically targeted information (“services”), FMU may require that users provide their name and e-mail address.The university does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining parental consent.  Before registering for an account to use the services of the site, FMU requests that all minors have their parents read the Privacy Policy and continue their involvement throughout the registration process.FMU does not control the acts of this site’s members or visitors.  All members and visitors should be aware that their disclosure of personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room, guest book, or other forum allows other parties to send them unsolicited e-mail.  In the event visitors encounter any user on this site who is improperly collecting or using information provided by the site’s members or visitors, please contact webmaster@fmarion.edu.
How the University Uses/Does Not Use Gathered Information
Please take some time to become familiar with the different ways FMU uses the information gathered.  Keep in mind that, while the university encourages all third parties involved to adhere to this site’s Privacy Policy and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, FMU cannot and does not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from the university or independently.  Nevertheless, in the event users encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with FMU, who is improperly collecting or using personal information, please contact webmaster@fmarion.edu/ who will forward the message to the third party.
Use of non-personally identifiable information.  The university uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of the site visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the site.The site may contain links to other Internet Web site, including co-branded or other affiliated sites that may or may not be owned or operated by FMU.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the university is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites, including such sites’ use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors to the site click through links to those sites.  Even though such information might not identify the user personally, users should be familiar with the privacy practices of those other sites.
Use of personally identifiable information.  The university’s privacy policy serves as notice to potential registrants of this site whose personally identifiable information may be collected during the registration process.  Although users may not “opt out” of the registration process and still receive access to the services, users may choose to “opt out” of receiving promotional materials from the university and/or other business partners.  If the user does not “opt out” of receiving such promotional materials, FMU reserves the right to release user’s personally identifiable registration information to third parties who provide goods or services that the university believes may be of interest to the user.  If the user decides to discontinue receiving promotional information from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly, or contact FMU at webmaster@fmarion.edu.
FMU limits its own e-mail contact and solicitations to those users who have not “opted out” of receiving such communications.  The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the user with a method of “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar nature.
Finally, FMU may use individual members’ data to “pre-populate” forms, which are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by the university.  In no case does pre-populating a form transfer any data to any third party.  Only if the user voluntarily requests that such data be transferred will any transfer take place – for example, if/when a user clicks a “submit form” button or other button.
FMU reserves the right to release any and all information contained within access logs concerning any visitor when that visitor is in violation of the university’s “Terms of Service” agreement or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in response to discovery requests, or in response to any circumstance in which the university, in its sole discretion, deems an emergency.  FMU cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using its servers or services for illegal activities.  FMU also reserves the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.
FMU will post the relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for any promotions it sponsors.  That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion.
Security
All information gathered on the site is stored within a controlled database accessible only to the university to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under its control.  However, as effective as any security measure implemented by the university may be, no security system is impenetrable.  FMU cannot guarantee the security of its database, nor can it guarantee that the information supplied by users will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.  Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to webmaster@fmarion.edu.
Your Rights
Where authorized and subject to all applicable laws, you may have the right to request access to, a copy of, rectification, restriction in the use of, or erasure of your information. You also have the right to withdraw consent to the use of your information, without affecting the legitimacy of the University’s use of the information prior to receipt of your request.
If users would like to have personally identifiable information changed or removed from FMU’s database, please contact webmaster@fmarion.edu. Keep in mind that there will be residual information remaining within the databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, the university reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or users of this site if lawful.
Information collected in the European Union will be transferred out of the European Union to the University. If you believe that the University has not complied with applicable foreign laws regulating such data or data transfers, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate authorities.

University CommunicationsInternal and External CommunicationsPURPOSE:  The University Communications Office is responsible for communicating the story of Francis Marion University to its various publics—on and off campus—by establishing and increasing awareness of University programs, policies, opportunities, goals, and achievements. The purpose of this document is to establish policies governing official University publications, communication with the mass media, and public service radio-television programs that reflect on the role, scope, mission, stature, and identity of the Pee Dee region’s major university.
Freedom of Information Act: Francis Marion University favors transparency with the public and media in regard to its operations and activities. Requests for information will be processed expediently, but may be reviewed by University Communications and the University’s General Counsel. Formal FOIA requests should be sent to the Counsel and will be reviewed by Counsel and the VP of Communications. FOIA email: jedwards@fmarion.edu.
GENERAL POLICY:  The following statements reflect Francis Marion’s policy related to publications; desktop electronic publishing; letterhead, logo and seal; news service; photography; and electronic media.
Publications
To provide service to the divisions of Francis Marion University and to ensure that printed matter for public distribution reflect the goals and image of this institution, it is desirable that uniform practices be followed in planning, editing, designing, purchasing, and producing such materials.
Therefore, supervision and production of all University publications (catalogs, pamphlets, booklets, brochures, fliers, posters, newsletters and other similar printed matter) shall be centralized in and coordinated by the University Communications Office. This office will determine the need for and purpose of publications and to ensure that they contribute to and reflect favorably on the University.
The department requesting issuance of a publication shall be responsible for providing the necessary funds for production and distribution of the publication unless such funds are included in the University’s publications budget.
The department requesting issuance of a publication shall be responsible for determining that the departmental chairperson, the dean or the Office of the Provost has reviewed and approved the publication for academic content, especially statements about educational policy, program offerings, and/or admission to the University.
Desktop Electronic Publishing
Many campus departments have access to desktop electronic publishing systems that can produce camera-ready documents for printing. Prior to printing, the University Communications Office should review desktop publishing documents planned for distribution to off-campus publics of more than 200.
The same procedures are to be followed for electronic publishing as for printing documents by conventional means to ensure accurate information, clarity of editing, consistency in style, and pleasing design that projects the University in the best possible light.
University Web Site
The University Communications Office shall be consulted about the content of information to be displayed on the University’s web page. It is desirable that the editorial content and design of web pages reflect favorably on the University, and the role of University Communications will be to assist in that effort. University Communications will not be responsible for the technical set-up of web sites but only with editorial content.
Letterhead, Logo, and Seal
Design of letterheads (both stationery and envelopes) for any department, division, program, institute, etc., within the University is to follow standard guidelines as determined by the institutional identity program of the University. University Communications must review any proposed letterhead prior to its submission to Printing Services for printing.
Use of the University logo must follow standard guidelines of the institutional identity program issued by the University Communications Office in conjunction with the Office of the President. The official name of the University is Francis Marion University and should be used where appropriate.
Words, letters, graphic devices and other indicia associated with Francis Marion University are protected against unauthorized use by means of federal and state trade or service mark registration, and/or state statute. Questions regarding the use of Francis Marion indicia should be directed to the University Communications Office.
Use of the University seal is restricted to more formal application. It is appropriate to use the seal on official and legal documents, diplomas, certificates, flags and official University ceremonial paraphernalia. The seal may never be distorted in any way and should never be used in such a manner that it gives the impression that it is the seal of any division, department or entity within the University.
The Crier
“The Crier” is the official internal newsletter and should be used by all departments to communicate vital information to the greater FMU community and friends. Written and edited by the University Communications Office staff, “The Crier” is published on the premise that better-informed employees are better citizens of the University.
News Service
To provide consistent, accurate information to the mass media, it is essential that Francis Marion maintain a centralized effort to coordinate the flow of information.  Uniform procedures must be followed in preparing and releasing statements and news releases so that the media will receive an organized flow of information that is consistent in style, quality and content.
Therefore, the planning, research, writing, and distribution of news stories, sports stories, University statements, public service announcements, feature articles, and other informational materials (including photographs) released to the media should be centralized in and coordinated by the University Communications Office.
All University-generated news releases about programs, activities, and people of the University shall be approved in advance by the VP for University Communications who shall consult with the president and other appropriate administrators when necessary.
This policy is not intended to handicap or restrict faculty and staff from expressing opinions or providing information to media representatives regarding their research and/or areas of expertise. It does apply, however, in regard to questions of University policy that should be referred to an appropriate administrator or the University Communications Office.
In instances of direct media contact, faculty and staff members may ask to call the reporter back and contact the University Communications Office for advice and counsel prior to consenting to interviews, particularly on sensitive questions. Employees should always state that views given are personal opinions and not necessarily those of their colleagues or the University.
In the event of an emergency, crisis, or controversy, the President may designate a spokesperson for the University. In that event, all media calls regarding that particular situation shall be referred to the spokesperson through the University Communications Office.
Electronic Media
It is desirable that uniform practices be followed in planning, writing, producing and distributing electronic media programs to uniformly reflect the goals and image of Francis Marion University. This includes public service radio and television programs promoting the University as well as all recruiting and promotional radio and television products about the University. Therefore, the University Communications Office should be involved in the planning and distribution of University produced programs for external audiences.
The department requesting issuance of such broadcast materials shall be responsible for providing the necessary funds for production and distribution of the materials unless such funds are included in the budget of University Communications.
This policy applies only to news, public service, recruiting and promotional radio and television programs originated by the University for internal and external use.  Exclusions from this policy are scholarly and instructional audio/visual products and those programs produced by student media.
Questions about these policies may be directed to the VP for University Communications, telephone 661-1220.
Printing ServicesThe Printing Services division of the Public Affairs Office is located in the Office Services Building (tan building located between Stanton Academic Computer Center and the Hyman Fine Arts Building) and provides a broad range of professional design and printing services to the University community.
Publication services include editing, desktop publishing, graphics design, typesetting, pre-press, as well as other functions to assist members of the University community in planning and preparing a document for publication.
Printing services include high-speed black and white photocopying, full-color photocopying and various finishing and bindery options. Examples of printed materials include applications, letterhead, envelopes, business cards, brochures, certificates, forms, fliers, invitations, manuals, newsletters, notepads, postcards, posters, programs, reports, tickets, and more.
Every effort should be made to utilize University resources to produce your job. An order that is beyond the capability of FMU Printing Services should be submitted to the director of publications & marketing who will develop job specifications and coordinate with a commercial vendor to complete your job.
Requests for campus publications and printing projects should be submitted on a “Printing Work Order” form which must include an account name, budget number and approval of the department head, dean or office manager. Forms are available in faculty secretary offices or from the Printing Services office.
Copyrighted materials will not be reproduced without written permission from the copyright owner.
Travel Polices: Faculty, Staff, and StudentsAlthough travel funds are limited, the University encourages attendance at off-campus professional activities by assisting with travel expenses.   It is expected that the budgets of all departments will be adequate to provide some financial assistance for professional travel.  At the same time, employees may be expected to share the cost of professional travel, especially when meetings are held at a great distance from the campus.
Vehicles Dispatched by the University (University owned or rented) University vehicles are to be used when available but cannot be taken on trips extending over a considerable time period.  When vehicles are dispatched by the University, they will be charged to the Department’s budget at the rate of 58 cents per mile or the cost of the rental and fuel. The 2018-2019 General Appropriations Act in Proviso 117.21.J provides for mileage reimbursements at the standard business mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service rate will be 58 cents per mile (IRS Revenue IR 2013-95). Reimbursement for trips taken on or after January 1, 2019, will be at the rate of 58 cents per mile.
Link to Facilities Management- Vehicle Reservations/ Rentals.
Travel Request and Reimbursement Forms
The form to be used in conjunction with travel is available from Accounting.  The upper travel request portion of this form is to be completed by the Traveler and submitted to the Department Chairman or Supervisor in advance of a scheduled trip.  The gold copy of the approved request should be submitted to Accounting if registration fees and/or airline tickets are to be paid in advance, if a vehicle is to be rented, or if a travel advance is requested.  The pink copy of the approved request is submitted to the Facilities Management Office to reserve a vehicle.  Upon return, the Traveler completes the reimbursement portion of the form, obtains appropriate approval and submits the original form to Accounting in order that the reimbursements for approved expenses can be made.
Any foreign travel of a State employee must be reported by the University to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of  the House, and the Budget and Control Board at the end of the fiscal year.  For the purpose of this regulation, foreign travel is defined as any destination outside the continental limits of the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  Other travel is reported by individual as requested by the Office of the Comptroller General.
Airfare
The traveler should make inquiries several weeks before the trip in order to receive the best rates.  If a pre-approved travel agency is used to book the ticket, Accounting must receive an approved travel request with ticket cost and appropriate budget number in order to authorize the charge.  The traveler may do an online purchase and receive reimbursement upon return from the trip.  A receipt showing proof of payment must be indicated on the itinerary for the cost of the ticket.  The traveler may have to return to the website 24 hours later to print a receipt or in some cases, the traveler may receive a receipt via e-mail.  Credit card statements are not valid receipts as indicated on the travel request form.  The traveler may also call Accounts Payable to set up an appointment to purchase the ticket online with the University’s travel card.  The traveler must have an approved travel request with estimated ticket cost and appropriate budget number.
Allowances
Employees traveling on official business of the University may, upon presentation of a paid receipt, be allowed reimbursement for actual expenses incurred for lodging, limited to in-state costs per night of $125.00 and out-of-state costs of similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00 per night.
Employees may also be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred in the obtaining of meals except that such costs shall not exceed $25.00 per day in-state and $32.00 per day out-of-state.
The mileage reimbursements at the rate of 53.5 cents per mile will be made when an employee uses a personal automobile in travelling on University business.  Travel by commercial airlines is encouraged so valuable time will not be spent in slower ground travel.   Total transportation allowance will not exceed tourist airfare.
Special Rules
Reimbursement will be made for meals for trips of a day’s duration or shorter.   Regulations appearing below will apply.  In accordance with Internal Revenue requirements, the appropriate tax form will be generated reflecting such reimbursements.
Receipts for meal and taxi expenditures are not necessary.  Receipts for all other expenditures must be submitted.  The State will not accept cancelled checks or copies of credit card invoices in lieu of receipts.
No reimbursement for overnight accommodation will be made within fifty (50) miles of the traveler’s official headquarters and/or residence.
Registration receipts must accompany travel voucher.
Employees earning frequent flyer premiums while traveling on State business must use them to reduce the cost of subsequent business travel whenever possible.

This procedure should be used in completing the Travel Request portion of the form prior to departure and the Travel Reimbursement section of the form on returning from trips.

Hotel/Motel – Actual hotel/motel costs will be  reimbursed when a paid original receipt is presented and attached to the travel voucher.  It is expected that persons traveling for Francis Marion University generally will limit in-state hotel/motel costs to $125.00 and out-of-state costs to similar amounts except for large urban cities which should be limited to $175.00.  Exceeding these limits will require special justification to be approved by the appropriate Vice President.
Parking – Parking fees for State-owned and privately owned vehicles are reimbursable upon presentation of a paid receipt.
Porterage and Gratuities – Gratuities are not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  When paid as part of a billing for a banquet, luncheon, etc., gratuities will be allowed.  Porterage, in general, is not an allowable reimbursement for state employees.  It may be reimbursed when an employee flies to a major city out-of-state where there is no option concerning baggage handling.   Porterage may also be reimbursed when an employee has heavy, excess equipment needed to conduct official University business.

If student travel is required for a course, the professor must on the first day of class issue to each student in the course a “Field Trip/Off Campus Academic Activities Release Form.”  This form may be attained from each Schools Dean’s office or the Provost’s Office.  Each student who acknowledges this travel requirement and wishes to remain in the course must sign and date the form and write in his/her Social Security number.  The professor must then collect these forms, sign them, and obtain the school dean or department chair’s signature.  Once the forms are complete, all white copies must be forwarded to the Provost’s Office and the yellow copies delivered to the students.
If student travel is associated with any Student Life activity, each student member of the club/organization will be required by the faculty/staff sponsor to complete a “Student Life Travel Release Form” prior to traveling, including a parent/guardian’s signature if the student is under 18 years of age.  This form may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office.  The faculty/staff sponsor must then obtain the signature of either the Assistant Vice President of Student Development or the Vice President for Student Affairs.  Once the forms have been completed, the faculty/staff sponsor must forward all white copies to the Student Affairs Office and the yellow copies to the student.
The responsible faculty or staff member will note on travel request forms that all students traveling have completed an appropriate release form.

Procurement (Purchasing)General InformationPurpose: These procedures are a summary guide for University departments which outline procedures for processing requirements through the Purchasing Office. Through these procedures, we have attempted to relate the policies and objectives necessary to procure goods and services for your department.
Authorities:
All purchases must be made through the Purchasing Office.
Procurement Code: The South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code governs the expenditure of all funds regardless of source unless specifically exempted.
The Purchasing Office will adhere to and abide by the Procurement Code and its implementing regulations.
Where a procurement involves the expenditure of federal grant or contract funds, Francis Marion University is required to comply with the federal law and authorized regulations which are applicable even if not presently reflected in the South Carolina Procurement Code.
Certification: The Office of General Services of the Budget and Control Board has certified Francis Marion University to make direct purchases of up to $275,000 for goods/services, $175,000 for information technology, $175,000 for construction contracts, and $150,000 for consultant services.
Contracts: A purchase order constitutes a contract binding the University and the supplier.
The Vice President for Finance and Facilities, Director of Purchasing, and designated procurement officers are the only persons authorized to bind Francis Marion University except as delegated under the purchasing card program.
Correspondence with Vendors:
Correspondence pertaining to a purchase order involving prices, terms, conditions, delivery, quantity, substitution, complaint, or anything whatsoever involving the commitment, shall be conducted by the Purchasing Office.
Direct correspondence by faculty and staff is accepted practice for obtaining instructional information, availability, or requests for literature, etc.
Faculty and staff personnel should refrain from any correspondence which may be interpreted as committing Francis Marion University to a binding contract.
Coordination: Departments are encouraged to coordinate with the Purchasing Office in advance of purchase requisition submission for complex high-value procurement actions.
Planning for Your Purchase
Authorities: All purchases must be made through the Purchasing Office.
It is important that departments properly plan their purchasing actions.
Requisitions for Goods and Services are entered via Patriot Portal; fund and departmental budget approvals are then attained electronically.
Quotations and Fair and Reasonable justifications are forwarded to purchasing for review.
Departments must allow for competition and purchase order processing time when planning purchases.
It is the responsibility of the Purchasing Office to originate, control, and analyze quotations, bids, and proposals.
The department’s responsibility includes defining quality, quantity, specifications, delivery date requirements, and all other pertinent information essential to proper purchase.
The requisitioning department must also suggest sources, when known, especially for unusual or unique items and may be called upon to assist the procurement officer in evaluating the quotes, bids, or proposals received.
Coordination: Departments are encouraged to coordinate with the Purchasing Office in advance of purchase requisition submission for complex high-value procurement actions.
We cannot overemphasize the need for departments to plan their needs well in advance and involve the Purchasing Office in the planning stage.
The University is required to utilize existing STATE CONTRACTS for any purchase of goods or services offered on a state contract. The state has contracts with select vendors to provide agencies with goods and services and information technology.
Goods and Services
Information Technology
Purchase RequisitionOriginator Responsibilities:
Determines if the purchase will require special facilities for the good or service. (If so, see Equipment Purchases.)
Completes “Requisition for Goods and Services” in Patriot Portal.
Is the designated recipient of delivered goods unless otherwise noted on the requisition. Storage and/or installation are the responsibility of the originator.
Purchasing Office Responsibilities:
Upon receipt of the requisition, verifies that the appropriate department and fund budget approvals have been applied, and determines if sufficient funds are available. Requisitions not properly approved or lacking sufficient funds in the requested budget will be referred back to the requestor to attain approvals or to arrange for sufficient funds to be provided prior to considering the requisition for purchase.
Determines appropriate solicitation methods, obtains competition as appropriate, and issues a Purchase Order.
Sends copy of the Purchase Order to the originator, who verifies it as being consistent with the requisition. Discrepancies should be immediately brought to the attention of the Purchasing Office. After verification, the Purchase Order should be retained by the originator, or in a central location as determined by the Department Head for future reference.
Purchases must be verified by the originator as received before Accounting can pay an invoice for the purchase.  Requestor will go to “Receive Goods and Services” in Patriot Portal to receive an item or items from the purchase order for this purpose.  In the event that a requestor does not have access to the purchase order in Patriot Portal, the requestor should forward a receiving copy of the purchase order with printed completion instructions to the originator. The requestor shall verify receipt of goods or services when received on the receiving copy, then forward the receiving copy to the Purchasing Office. The Department Head may designate a limited number of staff to accomplish these tasks on his/her behalf. .
Requisition initiator responsibilities:
Receives the item(s) from the purchase order in Patriot Portal. Timely and accurate completion of this task is the basis for payment to the vendor. It is important to receive the item in Patriot Portal as soon as possible after the goods or services have been provided by the vendor.
If the recipient of the purchased goods or services is not the requisition initiator, then the recipient must inform the initiator in writing that they have received the goods or services; the initiator should then receive the item in Patriot Portal.  The recipient may instead initial and date the receiving copy of the purchase order as received, then provide the receiving copy to the Purchasing Department.
Purchasing ThresholdsPurchases up to $5,000.00: Small purchases not exceeding $5,000.00 may be made without securing competitive quotations if the prices are considered fair and reasonable.
If the total estimate is close to $5,000.00 or if the procurement officer feels a better price can be obtained, the order may be informally bid to attain multiple competing quotations.
Final discretionary authority rests with the procurement officer. Otherwise, the orders are processed and sent directly to the suggested vendor.
Purchases from $5,000.01 to $25,000.00: Attaining a minimum of three written quotations from responsible vendors is required prior to award.
These quotations will be solicited by a procurement officer, or written quotations will be accepted from departments provided the quote accurately addresses the item(s) to be purchased, is signed by the vendor, and includes sufficient information for verification by the Purchasing Office.
Whenever possible, the vendor community must be solicited consistently when attaining quotations.  (The easiest method is for a blind copied e-mail requesting the quotation sent to the vendor community contacts.)  If a quotation is attained by telephone, the time, date, and details of the quote including the contact at the vendor must be documented to qualify as a valid quotation.
A no quote from a vendor, or a non-response from a vendor to a quotation request does not constitute a quotation when meeting the three quotation minimum.
A price from a catalog (internet or otherwise) does not constitute a quotation when meeting the three quotation minimum.  A catalog price serves as a quotation if the vendor verifies in writing that the catalog price is the best price their company can provide for a quotation.
Collected quotations provided by the initiator at the University must contain sufficient information for verification (i.e. vendor name, contact person, e-mail, phone number). The information must be confirmed by the Purchasing Office prior to award.
Purchases from $25,000.01 to $50,000.00: Written solicitation of written quotes, bids, or proposals shall be made via a formal solicitation process initiated by the Purchasing Department.
The procurement shall be advertised at least once in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication. (Quotations will not be accepted from departments.)
Purchases greater than $50,000 are required to be awarded on the basis of competitive sealed bids/proposals. Francis Marion is certified up to the following levels:
Goods and Services:            $275,000
Information Technology:    $175,000
Construction Contracts:      $175,000
Consultant Services:             $150,000
This procurement methodology requires advanced planning, advertising, public opening of bids/proposals and analysis prior to award of the contract.
Departments must allow a minimum of forty-five (45) days for these procedures after submitting a purchase requisition.
The procurement shall be advertised at least once in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication.
Purchases greater than the certification levels listed above must be competitively bid by the State Materials Management Office.
Departments must allow a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days for these purchases after submitting a purchase requisition for Purchases over the certification levels indicated above.
Requests for PaymentRequest for Payment: Arrangement for a direct payment of an invoice for a one time purchase of goods or services valued $5,000.00 or less
Upon receipt of an invoice from a vendor for goods or services received by the University totaling $5,000.00 or less, complete a “Request a Payment” in Patriot Portal, denote the voucher number (provided after successfully entering the request) on the invoice, then forward the invoice to Purchasing.  A scanned copy of the invoice may be e-mailed to Purchasing instead of sending a hard copy.
Emergency PurchasesEmergency Purchases: When purchases must be made on an emergency basis, the department head should contact the Director of Purchasing and request an emergency purchase. The following information will be required prior to approval:
Name of vendor
Amount of purchase
Name of requestor
Description of item or service to be purchased
Nature of emergency
In cases where the exact amount of the purchase is not known, an estimate must be made. Competition will be solicited, if possible. Upon receipt of the emergency purchase order number or emergency requisition number, the vendor may be notified and the goods/services procured.  An Emergency Purchase determination can only be made by the Director of Purchasing, and for emergency purchases greater than $10,000.00, determination is made by the Director of Purchasing through the Vice President for Finance and Facilities.
Per the South Carolina Procurement Code, all emergency purchases valued $50,000.00 or greater shall be advertised in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication.
NOTE:  FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE A REQUIREMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN EMERGENCY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA PROCUREMENT CODE.
Equipment PurchasesEquipment Purchases:
An item is generally deemed equipment if the item is valued $5,000.00 or greater, and has a life expectancy of at least one year.  Contact the Purchasing Department prior to considering a purchase of this nature for a determination of whether or not the item(s) you are intending to purchase should or should not be deemed an equipment purchase.
The purchase or acquisition of high value equipment often requires a minimum of 30 days to process; therefore, it is important to anticipate equipment needs for your department.
Printing Equipment: All purchases of printing equipment in excess of $50,000.00 require approval of the state’s information technology planning office.
Equipment-Lease, Lease/Payment, Installment Purchase and Rental: Acquisition of equipment by any means other than purchase must be fully justified. (Many purchases in this category require prior approval from General Services or the State Treasurer and therefore may involve longer processing time prior to the actual placing of the order; therefore, plan accordingly.)
Equipment Trade-in: Items may be used for trade-in credit when purchasing or leasing new, like items.
Consult with the Director of Facilities Management to ensure all requirements can be met prior to requisitioning any equipment which requires:
Permanent connection to the building or to any building service (electricity, water supply or drain, ventilation, gas, air, steam, etc.).
The addition or extension of any building service, including electricity at a different voltage or increase in power available.
Special cabinetry, support, or housing not acquired as part of the equipment.
Special environmental conditions, such as control of temperature or humidity.
Special transportation due to the item being large or heavy.
Cutting, patching, or building modification.
Sole Source PurchasesThe basis for the sole source determination and the reason no other product or vendor is suitable are required. The Purchasing Office cannot adequately answer these questions without your input. Sole Source determinations can only be made by the Director of Purchasing, and for procurements greater than $10,000.00, determination is made by the Director of Purchasing through the Vice President for Finance and Facilities.
Per the South Carolina Procurement Code, all sole source procurements valued $50,000.00 or greater shall be advertised in the South Carolina Business Opportunities publication.
NOTE: COMPETITION SHALL BE SOLICITED IN CASES OF REASONABLE DOUBT.
Art PurchasesTo purchase art objects such as paintings, antiques, sculptures or similar objects costing greater than $1,000.00, the President or his designee is required to provide written determination specifying the need for such objects and the benefits to the State. Such written determination will be forwarded to the South Carolina Arts Commission for approval prior to purchase. Departments desiring to purchase art objects will enter their purchase requisition and forward a memorandum to the Purchasing Office specifying the need for such objects and the benefits to the State.
Gift Card PurchasesGUIDELINES FOR GIFT CARD USAGE
Purpose
To comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax withholding and reporting obligations, this document provides guidelines for the purchase and distribution of gift cards/certificates purchased with University funds.
According to IRS rules, because cash and cash equivalents, such as gift cards/certificates, have a readily ascertainable value, they are considered taxable income regardless of the face amount of the gift card/certificates.
If an individual receives gift cards, awards or payments during the calendar year in excess of $600, the entire amount will be reported on Form 1099-MISC. If there is any indication that an individual might receive $600 during the year, a W-9 form should be requested at the time of gift card distribution.
Gift Cards to Students
Student Life / Programming Board budgets along with select grants may purchase gift cards to be used as door prizes, incentives, or awards of recognition; however, such compensation may be taxable income to the recipient.
Payment to participants of University research or survey projects may be compensated with a gift card; however, such compensation may be taxable income to the recipient.
Gift cards may be purchased from the Patriot Bookstore utilizing the Purchase Requisition process regardless of the anticipated total value of the Gift Cards to be purchased. Gift cards may not be purchased via a University Procurement Card (P-Card) per State Procurement regulations or by using a Departmental Charge account at the Patriot Bookstore.
The value of all gifts and gift cards/certificates given to non-employees in an aggregate amount of $600.00 or more per calendar year must be reported to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC as other compensation.
Gift cards should not be given in exchange for services.  For example, gift cards should not be given to student workers for work performed.
Students who are Nonresident Aliens: According to the IRS, gift cards/certificates given to individuals who are nonresident aliens are subject to federal tax withholding which the department will be responsible for unless an exception applies.  Please contact the Office of Accounting before providing gift cards/certificates to individuals who are Nonresident Aliens so that the University may comply with this law.
Gifts Cards to Employees
Gift cards or gift certificates cannot be given to a University employee using University funds.
According to the IRS, the value of gifts and gift cards/certificates given to employees using University funds is considered compensation (taxable income) subject to federal, state and employment tax withholding, and reporting on Form W-2 during the calendar year the gift card was received.
Procedures
All gift card requests regardless of planned value must be made via a Purchase Requisition regardless of the anticipated total value of the Gift Cards to be purchased.
The University’s Bookstore Contractor, Follett, will accept an FMU Purchase Order for gift cards.
In order to purchase a gift card, please complete a Purchase Requisition and a Gift Card Purchase Authorization Form and forward to the Purchasing Office. A separate authorization form must be completed for each program, activity, or specific event.
It is recommended to limit the number of gift cards purchased at one time to facilitate card disbursement and reconciliation.
The Purchasing Office will issue a Purchase Order to Follett
Follett will provide gift cards to the requesting department once a Purchase Order is received.
Please contact the FMU Purchasing Departments if attempting to purchase a gift card from another vendor besides Follett.
Gift Card Disbursement Log
The department should complete a Gift Card Disbursement Log to record the disbursement of all gift cards purchased, even if only one card. For example, if a department purchases five gift cards for $50 but only disburses two, the disbursement log should reflect that three gift cards still remain open and the log will be completed when the final three cards are distributed.
The completed Gift Card Disbursement Log must be returned to the FMU Office of Accounting.
Control of Gift Cards
Gift Cards should be kept under lock and key at all times to ensure proper physical security and to protect from theft and loss.
Access to the gift cards and keys to the locked areas should be limited to the individual(s) responsible for safekeeping the gift cards.
File Retention
The Gift Card Disbursement Log, Gift Card Purchase Authorization Form and the accompanying Purchase Order should be retained in the requestor’s departmental files for three years.
Questions/Concerns
If you have any questions on purchasing a gift card, please contact the Purchasing Office at (843) 661-1160 or the Accounting Office at (843) 661-1120.
Blanket Purchase OrdersBlanket Purchase Orders are contracts issued to establish and monitor use of products or services for a specified period of time and to increase efficiency in administration of those agreements. Contracts issued as such will be competed appropriately by the Purchasing Office and when established will clearly indicate term and pricing on the purchase order.  Per the South Carolina Procurement Code, no Blanket Purchase Order shall exceed a term greater than one year in length.
The using department will be responsible for:
Reviewing invoices for accuracy and resolving any discrepancy with the vendor.
Identifying and noting the applicable purchase order number on the invoice.
Forwarding the invoice to the Office of Accounting for payment.
Monitoring expiration dates.
ReimbursementsUnder some circumstances, traditional methods of purchase may not be applicable or practical. In those cases, faculty/staff members may opt to expend personal funds for necessary departmental supplies and be reimbursed for cost of those supplies, provided that:
Established purchasing methods are not feasible (i.e. purchase order documents or procurement cards are not an option).
The reimbursement request relates to departmental supplies only. Services, travel, or other forms of personal reimbursement will not qualify.
The requestor insures their departmental policies or procedures are not violated.
The items do not conflict with established contracts.
Reimbursements should be the last purchasing method considered. Requests not in compliance may require completion of a Ratification of Unauthorized Procurement form prior to processing.
Reimbursement requests should be submitted as a “Request a Payment” in Patriot Portal with all supporting documentation including paid receipts provided to the Purchasing Department.  After fund and department budget approvals for the request for payment have been applied in Patriot Portal, the supporting documentation will be forwarded to the Office of Accounting for payment processing.
Unauthorized ProcurementsAn unauthorized purchase is defined as the obligation of payment for goods and services made by any person without the requisite authority to do so by an appointment or delegation under the provisions of the South Carolina Procurement Code and Francis Marion University guidelines. When an individual without that authority commits the University to a contract, State law requires that the agency head ratify that contract. This is accomplished by having a Ratification of Unauthorized Procurement form completed and signed by the individual. The form should then be routed through those responsible for the budget for signature, then to the President for final approval.
Construction ProcurementsThe University will adhere to guidelines established by the Office of State Engineer in conjunction with the South Carolina Procurement Code requirements for construction procurements. The Facilities Management Department is the requestor for construction procurement.
Purchases from Other State AgenciesPurchases from other state agencies, except those specifically exempted, must meet the same competitive tests as purchases from outside vendors and require a purchase order in advance.
Purchases of In-State Conference FacilitiesThere are guidelines which must be followed when selecting conference facilities for which expenditures of State funds are involved. The guidelines apply to all hotel or motel facilities regardless of what the gathering is called, e.g., meeting, seminar, conference, workshop, retreat, etc. If such a meeting is being planned, contact the Director of Purchasing for details.
ServicesCatering Services: The University’s official food service contractor is the primary source of catering for official functions.
Catering from a vendor other than the University’s official food service contractor will not normally be authorized unless the official food service contractor has indicated in writing that it cannot provide the requested service.
Catering services from outside vendors, when authorized, must be solicited in accordance with the South Carolina Procurement Code, and within the University’s Internal Procurement Regulations.
This policy is both a contractual matter and an economic matter since Francis Marion University receives a designated percentage of catering services revenues from the University’s food service contractor.
Consultant Services: Departments requesting consultant services should submit a “Requisition for Goods and Services” in Patriot Portal, and submit a corresponding Scope of Work to the Purchasing Department that at a minimum contains the following information:
Definition of need
Expected results from consultant
Specific qualifications the consultant must possess
Period services will be needed
Selection criteria to be used in judging consultant proposals
Number, type and frequency of reports required
Payment terms
Employee Services: Requests for employee services are to be made to the Office of Human Resources.
Legal and Auditing Services:
Retaining legal services for the University requires prior approval of the State Attorney General’s Office.
Procurement of certified public accountants and public accountants to perform financial and/or compliance audits are exempt from competition but are subject to approval by the State Auditor’s Office.
Photocopying and Duplicating: Copy machines are located in various locations on campus and are provided with codes for recording departmental copies. Please contact the Purchasing Office if you have a question regarding departmental copier usage.
(Supplies for Copiers) Paper for departmental copies are requested by submitting an e-mail to the work order center at workreq@fmarion.edu.
Printing Services: Francis Marion University Publications and Printing Office is the preferred source for all printing requirements.
Printing services from outside printers shall be solicited in accordance with the South Carolina Procurement Code and within the University’s Internal Procurement Regulations using printing specification sheet(s) or forms specifications.
Departments requiring printing services from outside sources shall enter a “Requisition for Goods and Services” in Patriot Portal and forward the appropriate specifications to the Purchasing Office.
Specification sheets or forms specifications may be obtained from the Printing Office.
Professional Services: When professional services are to be obtained under an independent contractual relationship, wherein the University relinquishes the RIGHT to DIRECT or CONTROL the professional in the method of performance or the end results of his/her efforts as defined in IRS regulations, then procurement must be accomplished as directed in the South Carolina Procurement Code and ensuing Regulations.
Professionals with fees greater than $5,000.00 who are unique in their applicability to University programs may qualify for “sole source” procurement action. Such determination can only be made by the Director of Purchasing, and for fees greater than $10,000.00, determination is made by the Director of Purchasing through the Vice President for Finance and Facilities.
Proposed contracts, which do not qualify as “sole source” will require competitive bidding.
Repair Services: Requests for repair services, under normal or non-critical circumstances, will be processed as a routine purchase.
Whenever equipment is in need of immediate repair or the repair service is critical to department operations and regular procedures cannot be followed, the department should follow the Emergency Purchases procedures.
Revenue Generating ContractsRevenue generating contracts are those where there is a sales management agreement with an outside contractor and the contractor pays Francis Marion University a commission or some other consideration. These contracts are subject to the South Carolina Procurement Code. Examples of management services covered are:
Bookstore management
Food Service management
Vending management
Sports marketing
Novelty and trademark rights
Cash management by banks

Detrek Browning stayed true to FMU and became the school’s all-time leading scorer
In an early January game against Clayton State, Detrek Browning waited calmly behind the three-point line while teammate Brandon Parker battled for a loose ball in the lane. Eventually, Parker swatted the ball towards Browning, who gathered it in, paused to set himself and casually flipped in a three-pointer that etched his name into a prominent place in the FMU record books. With that relatively unremarkable basket, Browning became something quite remarkable — the leading career scorer in the school’s almost 50-year-old history.
That the record-setter came on a routine play is not surprising. Browning’s calling card as a player is his ability to score, seemingly without effort; to make a unique ability to find ways to put ball basket appear quite ordinary.
What was remarkable about the play is that Browning was around to do it at all.
FMU Basketball standout Detrek Browning
The dynamics of college basketball at all levels have changed dramatically in the past decade. Players move regularly and easily from school to school, looking for the next bit of slightly greener grass; and there is not much hard-working coaches and schools can do about it. Their path is fraught with peril.
Bring a player along too slowly and he will leave for a situation where he can play/shoot/start more often. But, bring them along too quickly, develop them too well – and this is especially true for programs at Division II schools like FMU — and bigger schools will come calling. They can’t recruit a player, per se, until he puts his name on the NCAA’s official transfer list (which numbers each year in the thousands) but word gets around. Pssst. If your name is on that list. …
After he averaged 20.1 points a game for FMU in 2015-16, officially his sophomore season, word got around to Browning. There were schools out there – Division I schools – who were interested. And Browning knew the drill. Friends, foes, even some of his teammates, had gone that route.
“I was hearing from a few people,” Browning says, “and people were in my ear, telling me to go, that this was my big chance. But …”
But?
Browning shakes his head, shrugs his shoulders. The big decision, he says, was really no decision at all.
“Man, after all (FMU) has done for me … I mean, they were there for me when no one else was,” says Browning. “And the people here have always been great. This is where I belong. I wasn’t going anywhere. I guess maybe coach was worried, but I wasn’t leaving. “
Gary Edwards, Browning’s coach at FMU, admits to some nervousness during the spring in question. But those days are long past now and recalling them now brings a smile to Edwards’ face.
“Detrek’s done a lot of neat things here, made a lot of big plays, and he’ll always be one of my favorites,” says Edwards, “but if you ask me what I’ll remember most that’s it. It’s that loyalty that Detrek showed. That’s a rare quality. It’s better than all those points he scored.”
Things happen
Maybe Detrek Browning never should have wound up at FMU in the first place.
He wasn’t exactly a secret coming out of Irmo (S.C.) High School, just north of Columbia. Irmo, led by legendary coach Tim Whipple, is one of the premier high school basketball programs in South Carolina and Detrek Browning did nothing during his time with the Yellowjackets to lessen that.
Browning played three varsity seasons at Irmo and helped the team win two state championships. In his senior year Irmo went 29-0 — Whipple’s only unbeaten squad in 37 years  at the helm — and captured Whipple’s fifth state title.
Browning may not have been — may being the key word —  the best player on a team that also included University of South Carolina recruit Justin McKie. But he wasn’t a secret. He was receiving significant recruiting attention by his junior year and had a number of Division I programs giving him long looks.
But … things happened. One program that seemed like a sure thing signed another guard and never called Browning again. Another changed coaches. And so on.
Whipple says it was clear to him  — then and now — that Browning belonged on a Division I roster.
“Oh, there’s no doubt that the could play at that level,” says Whipple. “But you know, coaches look at things … it’s tough. He (Browning) was a little small maybe, kind of got in that in-between thing position wise. Was he a point guard or a shooting guard? He didn’t play much point for us until his senior year. But maybe he’s a little small for a D-I shooting guard, maybe he’s not that fast … So …”
So, early that year, one Edwards’ assistants at FMU saw Browning play and suggested the Patriots make a run at him. Edwards saw him and quickly agreed — “best point guard I saw all year,” Edwards said.
Edwards found out Browning’s recruiting had taken a funny turn and put on the full court press. When Browning came for his official visit, Edwards offered him a full scholarship on the spot.
Browning held out for a little while, waiting for the “better” offer that never came. Eventually his own good sense — all who know him see him as an extremely well-grounded person — and a little hectoring from his mom made him a Patriot.
“I kept thinking, ‘maybe a bigger school will offer me something,’” Browning says. “Meanwhile, mom is saying, ‘are you crazy? They’re offering you a full scholarship. They really want you. You know what? She was right.”
Red-shirt tears
One more test remained.
Though a polished player for a freshman, Browning arrived on the FMU campus to find Evrik Gary — the number three scorer in school history — already ensconced in the point guard role. Edwards and the Patriot staff persuaded Browning that the thing to do was sit out — redshirt is the term — his freshman season, just as Gary had done.
The move made sense, but it’s easier said than done. Redshirts spend all the practice time that regular players do but don’t get to play in the games, can’t even travel with the team to away contests.
“You’re really on your own a lot of times and have to stay focused to keep working on things, getting better, on your own,” says Browning. “That’s a good thing. There’s a lot to get used to moving from high school to college. It helped with basketball, with school, with everything.  I tell everyone now ‘Redshirt. That’s the way to do it. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.’ But it’s not easy. I’ll have to say there were a few nights where a few tears were shed. “
Conserving energy
One point — not the first point, but a point all the same — that Browning would make about his game, about the way he plays basketball is that he can dunk the ball.
“Most definitely,” says Browning. “I actually have two dunks in games (at FMU). I guess there could have been more — fans would like it — but it’s not something I was ever that excited about. A bucket is a bucket. I’d rather conserve my energy.”
Good at energy conservation. Now there’s a line that doesn’t show up on many scouting reports. But that aspect of Detrek Browning, basketball player, says about as much about his game as any. He glides around the court, under control, moving from place to place — moving from the right place to the right place — with a studied nonchalance that lulls opponents, fans and even his own coach into a state of disinterest.
“He’s one of those guys,” says FMU’s Edwards, “where you pick up the stat sheet afterwards and you say, ’Twenty-five points? How’d he do that? I didn’t see that.’ He’s very, very smooth.”
Browning’s chief skill is an absolute intangible. He has innate understanding of the game that allows him to see plays before they develop.
“It doesn’t just happen,” explains Browning. “I’ve had some very good coaches. And I do think about all the plays. I just think about them five or 10 seconds before they happen.”
Which is five or 10 (or more) seconds ahead of most.
Speed, shooting kill
The awards and honors are piling up fast in Browning’s final season. He’s been the Peach Belt Conference Player of the Week four times (through January), set the FMU single game scoring mark (41 points) in early January and is clearly poised to post-season accolades as well.
It’s all well-deserved, but still surprising all the same for Browning seldom looks like the best athlete on the floor. The 6-0, 180-pounder is a little stocky as basketball players go, and doesn’t have the chiseled musculature of some. His two dunks aside, he is not a great leaper, and he’s probably not the fastest guy around either, although as dozens of oft-burned Peach Belt Conference foes would attest, he is plenty fast enough.
Browning comes from a very athletic family. His mom (Carlissa), various uncles and aunts and cousins all played college sports. His brother is a good bit heavier than Detrek, “but can still beat me in a race. He can fly.
“My uncle (Milton Kershaw) who played football in college and is just crazy fast, taught me early on that speed kills,” says Browning. “It’s the most important part of most sports. But it’s not necessarily who is fastest. It’s who can be fast when they need to be.”
Browning is a fine defender (he will finish his career among FMU’s all-time leader in steals, too), but what sets him apart are his offensive skills. In Browning’s mind — a good place to start for analyzing basketball — the key skill is shooting. He has simple mechanics and feel for the shot that came to him almost from the moment he took up the game — he hit a long buzzer beater to win the championship game in his first year of organized basketball at age 12.
“If you can shoot the basketball, I mean really shoot it, you are basically unguardable,”  Browning says. “Try to stop the shot and it’s a fake and I’m by you for a pull up (jumper) or a layup.  Try to stop that and …. “
His voice trails off. Another basketball thought has popped into a mind that processes such information at an astonishing rate.
“It’s always amazing to me the number of basketball players — Division I players —  really can’t shoot,” says Browning. “That’s kind of the point of the game isn’t it?”
The Gary plan
Browning plans to follow in the footsteps of his former teammate Gary and play basketball professionally for as long as he can. Gary has been on an oddball world tour since he left FMU — Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Dubuque, Iowa and now, Cyprus — but he’s got a suitcase full of memorable experiences and … he’s still playing. The dream is still alive.
Browning understands. He knows he can play at a very high level and is eager to prove it, even if that means traveling some strange roads and learning even greater patience.
Whenever that is done, Browning suspects his long-term future lies … in coaching. He’s a Dean’s List student who’ll graduate in May with a degree in Psychology, and reservoir of knowledge that he thinks will translate nicely in that field.
“I seem to have a pretty good understanding of basketball,” says Browning. “I think that (coaching) could work out.”
Indeed.
