Bicycle Regulations
Cyclists should use extreme caution and slow down or walk their bicycles when interacting
with pedestrians. Cyclists should not use sidewalks and walkways when pedestrians
are present.
Automobiles are not required by law nor equipped with the reaction time to stop for
bikes shooting across crosswalks. It is best for bicyclists wishing to use crosswalks
to walk their bicycle through the crosswalk as a pedestrian.
Bicycles using campus roadways operate with the same rules as automobiles.
Bicyclists are strongly encouraged to wear safety equipment while on campus (including
helmets) as well as properly maintain the mechanical aspects of their bike for the
safest riding experience possible.
Bike Rack use on campus is mandatory. We are asking all bike riders to assist the
college by not locking bikes in such a way that they block sidewalks or handicap access
to buildings. Furthermore, we ask bike riders to refrain from locking bikes to campus
trees or foliage, light poles or other freestanding posts or any railings or any other
freestanding structures (except bike racks). Keep in mind we have students with disabilities
who require accessible pathways and specific access to buildings and we are required
by law to protect this access.
MCC is not responsible for loss or damage to bicycles.
Bikes locked or left anywhere else besides a bike rack are subject to the lock being
cut and the bike impounded by Campus Police.
