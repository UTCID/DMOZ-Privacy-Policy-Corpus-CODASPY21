111.10
Violation of the privacy rights accorded by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, portions of the State of California Education Code, and the Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records (see Section 130.00);
111.20
Discriminatory practices based upon sex, under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 or applicable federal or state laws, or under the Student-Related Policy Applying to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex (see Section 150.00).
111.30
Discriminatory practices based upon disability, under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or under the Guidelines Applying to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability (see Section 140.00);
111.40
Discriminatory practices based upon race, color, or national origin, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and
111.50
Other types of actions that may be grieved, such as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, age, or marital status, as specified in campus regulations.
112.00
Campus student grievance procedures shall be developed with student consultation, and shall at a minimum meet the requirements of applicable federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws. Once adopted, they shall serve as the sole remedy within the University for nonacademic student grievances brought pursuant to any such law.
112.00a
Grievances of discrimination specified in Sections 111.20 to 111.50 shall be filed with and resolved by the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity.
113.00
As provided in state law, civil or criminal law remedies including injunctions, restraining or other court orders, and monetary damages also may be available to complainants.
114.00
Assignment of grades to students enrolled in University classes is the exclusive prerogative of University faculty. Grade-related and other academic grievances are covered under separate policies established in consultation with the Academic Senate.
114.00
In accordance with Academic Senate policies, grade changes are authorized as follows:
A. Change of Grade - Clerical or Procedural Error The Registrar is authorized to change a final grade upon written request of an instructor provided a clerical or procedural error is the reason for the change.
B. Change of Grade - Grievance Redress
The Divisional Chair of the Academic Senate is authorized to direct the Registrar to change a final grade according to the provisions of (a) Student Academic Grievance Procedure 1.26 (See Appendix II of The Manual of the Academic Senate) or (b) Irvine Regulation A365(B), both of which require that a determination be made that a grade was assigned base on discrimination for reasons of race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, sex, or within the limits imposed by law or University regulations, because of age or citizenship.
Refer to The Manual of the Academic Senate, Irvine Regulation A365 and Appendix II of the same Manual.
