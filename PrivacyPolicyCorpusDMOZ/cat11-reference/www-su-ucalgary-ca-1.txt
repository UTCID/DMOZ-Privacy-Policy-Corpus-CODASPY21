We manage your personal information in accordance with Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).This policy outlines the principles and practices we follow in protecting your personal information.What is personal information?Personal information means information that can identify an individual (for example, name, home address, home phone number, email address, ID numbers), and information about an individual (for example, physical description, educational qualifications, blood type). For this policy to apply, the personal information in question must be about an individual, identify an individual, or be able to identify an individual.However, not all the information we collect about or from you is necessarily considered personal information. For example, business or student club contact information, which includes an individual’s name and position or title, along with the organization’s telephone number, mailing address, email, and other organizational contact information, is not considered personal information and is not covered by this policy.What personal information do we collect?The collection, use, or disclosure of personal information is limited to that which is necessary to conduct the SU’s day-to-day business and commercial activities and shall not be used for any other purposes except as authorized by the SU Privacy Officer.This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the personal information needed to:Establish, manage, or terminate the employment relationship between the SU and its employees and volunteers;Run the SU general election and by-election;Determine the financial eligibility and manage the lease of space within the MacEwan Student Centre;Provide a safe environment to patrons of the Den and Black Lounge;Manage the daily operation of the SU and its various businesses and services including, but not limited to, the MacEwan Conference and Events Centre, Den and Black Lounge, retail outlets including the Stör and Bound & Copied, the Clubs office, Volunteer Services, the Campus Food Bank, the Volunteer Tax Program, and the Information Centre; andRent lockers to students.We normally collect information directly from our employees and/or customers. We may collect your information from other persons with your consent or as authorized by law.We inform employees and/or customers, before or at the time of collecting personal information, of the purposes for which we are collecting the information.ConsentWe ask for consent to collect, use, or disclose personal information, except in specific circumstances where collection, use, or disclosure without consent is authorized or required by law. We may assume your consent in cases where you volunteer information for an obvious purpose.We ask for your express consent for some purposes and may not be able to provide certain services or access to businesses if you are unwilling to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of certain personal information. Where express consent is needed, we will normally ask customers to provide their consent verbally and in person or in writing by signing a consent form or by checking a box on a form, which may include electronic forms.A person may withdraw consent to the use and disclosure of personal information at any time, unless the personal information is necessary for us to fulfill our legal obligations. We will respect your decision, but we may not be able to provide you with certain services or access if we do not have the necessary personal information.We may collect, use, or disclose personal information without consent only as authorized by law. For example, we may not request consent when the collection, use, or disclosure is reasonable for an investigation or legal proceeding, to collect a debt owed to the SU, in an emergency that threatens life, health, or safety, or when the personal information is from a public source.How do we use and disclose personal information?We use and disclose personal information only for the purposes for which the information was collected, except as authorized by law. For example, we may disclose customer information to credit bureaus or credit companies to prevent fraud. The law also allows us to use contact information for collecting a debt owed should that be necessary.We do not distribute personal information to any private or public organizations, including the University of Calgary, without your consent, except as required by law.If we wish to use or disclose your personal information for any new business purpose other than the marketing of services or as set out herein, we will ask for your consent.How do we safeguard personal information?We make every reasonable effort to ensure that personal information is secure, accurate, and complete.We rely on persons who have provided us with information to notify us if there is a change to their personal information that may affect their relationship with the SU.

In some cases, we may ask for a written request for correction.We retain personal information only if is reasonable to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected or for legal or business purposes.We protect personal information in a manner appropriate for the sensitivity of the information.

This means that when you visit one of our websites, a limited amount of information which may identify you is passively collected, such as your IP address,the type of device, operating system, and browser you use, and your activity on our website. This information is used for statistical purposes only, to collect and count the number of visits to our websites. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.Some of our websites also use Facebook’s custom audience pixel. With its help, we can keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement. This enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research.

Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy.Our websites are protected, as necessary, by alphanumeric passwords, physical protection, and encryption.Our websites may contain links to other websites.

For example, organizations are required under PIPA to refuse to provide access to information that would reveal personal information about another individual. Organizations are also authorized under PIPA to refuse access to personal information if disclosure would reveal confidential business information, the information is privileged or contained in mediation records, orcould reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.If we refuse a request, in whole or in part, we will provide the reasons for the refusal.
