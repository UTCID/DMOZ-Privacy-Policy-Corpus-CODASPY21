(All such message boards, videos, surveys, blogs and other forums are collectively referred to herein as the "Forums," as further addressed in Section VI below.) In addition to, and without limitation of, any other prohibited content or behavior that is prohibited hereunder (see the Code of Conduct above in Section I, for example), users of the Forums may not post sexual, ethnic or racial or other discriminating slurs, or material which contains no relevant or constructive content or which goes beyond profanity into obscenity or abhorrence. Nor shall users identify individuals in a negative or derogatory fashion, unless such individuals are the high ranking officials of a company or have otherwise been covered in the media. If you believe a message violates our member policies, please contact Vault immediately at support@vault.com so that we may consider its editing or removal.
By sending or transmitting to us any information, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, resumes, other employment-related information or any other materials (collectively, "Submitted Materials"), or by posting such Submitted Materials to any area of the Site, you (i) represent and warrant to us that you have the legal right to post or submit your material, that you have the necessary permissions, consents, or licenses to post or submit your material, and that it will not violate any law or the rights of any person or entity, and (ii) grant us and our designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), assignable, transferable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), create derivative works of, edit, add content and logos to, publicly perform, modify, adapt, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import such Submitted Materials in any and all media or through any and all means, now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submitted Materials.
None of the Submitted Materials shall be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution, or otherwise, on our part and we shall not be liable for any use, display or disclosure of any Submitted Materials.
VI. Forums
The Forums are designed to help our visitors and Members obtain career and company information and discuss ways to make career decisions. This information on the Forums is sometimes provided by our staff and sometimes by other third party contributors, many of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with Vault. You should be aware that people may occasionally post messages or make statements in the Forums that are misleading, deceptive, wrong or otherwise objectionable. They may do this unintentionally, or even intentionally. Therefore, treat the other users of the Forums in the same way you would treat anyone you had met for the first time, because anyone can post to our Forums - no invitation is required.
Vault is not necessarily affiliated with or endorsed by the companies described or mentioned in the Forums. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants - our visitors and Members - and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Vault. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Site and the Forums and the materials you and other visitors may transmit or post. We also have the right, but not the obligation, to alter or remove any such materials (including, without limitation, any posting to a Forum), or to delete portions of or entire posts which violate the above rules, messages or topics that are unrelated to the specific message board on which they are posted, and advertisements, recruiting or other commercial messages, and to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to third parties in order to operate the Site properly; to protect ourselves, our sponsors, and our Members and visitors, and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. We may also impose limits on certain features of the Forums or restrict your access to part or all of the Forums without notice or penalty if we believe you are in breach of the guidelines set forth in this section, any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any applicable law, or for any other reason without notice of liability.
VII. Job Postings
By using the online job posting feature of the Site (the "Job Board"), in addition to and without limitation of any other prohibited content or behavior that is prohibited hereunder (see the Code of Conduct above in Section I, for example) you also agree not to:
1. Post any jobs in the Job Board or anywhere else on Site for any competitor of Vault or post jobs or other content that contains links to any site competitive with this Site;
2. Post jobs, information or content in the Job Board or anywhere else on Site that contains hyperlinks, "hidden" keywords or keywords that are irrelevant to the job or the posting or are otherwise misleading;
3. Use any information or content accessible on or via the Job Board or elsewhere on the Site for any purpose other than as an employer seeking employees, including but not limited to selling or promoting any products or services;
4. Post or submit to the Job Board or anywhere else on Site any incomplete, false, misleading or inaccurate biographical or other information, or any information or content which is not your own;
5. Use any feature of the Job Board or the Site to send any unsolicited communications to any user of the Site (including by mail, email, phone calls, text messages or faxes) regarding promotions and/or advertising of products or services;
6. Delete or revise any information or material posted by any other person or entity; or
7. Aggregate, copy or duplicate in any manner any of the information or content available from the Job Board or anywhere else on Site, without our prior express written consent.
As with the other Forums available on the Site, Vault is under no obligation to monitor the information residing on or transmitted to the Job Board or Resume Database (which information also shall be considered "Submitted Materials," as such term is defined hereunder), however, you agree that Vault reserves the right to modify, reject or eliminate any information residing on or transmitted to such areas of the Site, or terminate the account of any user of such areas, that Vault believes, in its sole discretion, to be unacceptable or in violation of these terms and conditions.
VIII. Third Party Web Sites
You may be able to link from the Site to third party web sites and third party web sites may link to the Site ("Linked Sites"). You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility for the information, content, products, services, advertising, code or other materials which may or may not be provided by or through Linked Sites. Links to Linked Sites do not constitute an endorsement or sponsorship by us of such web sites or the information, content, products, services, advertising, code or other materials presented on or through such web sites. Any reliance on the contents of a Linked Site is done at your own risk and you assume all responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance.
IX. Claims of Copyright Infringement
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Vault infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:
o a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
o identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
o identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Vault to locate the material on the Site;
o information reasonably sufficient to permit Vault to contact you, such as name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;
o a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
o a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Vault a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Liz Clarke, Vault.com Inc., 132 West 31st Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10001, (212) 366-4212 (telephone), (646) 349-9652 (fax), copyright@vault.com. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
