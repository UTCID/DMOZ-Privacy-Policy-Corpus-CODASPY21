Restrictions on the Use of California Health Interview Survey Data
The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is bound by promises made to respondents, by California law, and by University and government human subject protection committees to assure that no personal information is released in a form that identifies an individual without the consent of the person who supplied the information.
The California Information Practices Act (section 1798.24) provides that the data collected by CHIS may be released only for statistical research and reporting purposes. Any intentional re-identification or disclosure of personal information violates this law, and violates the privacy rights of the people who provided data to CHIS. Unauthorized disclosure of personal information is subject to civil action and penalties for invasion of privacy under California Civil Code, Section 1798.53.
