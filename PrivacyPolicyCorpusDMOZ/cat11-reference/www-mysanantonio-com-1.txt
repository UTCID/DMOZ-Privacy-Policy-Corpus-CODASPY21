Martinis & Manicures franchisee Chrissy Wolfson was relieved when her full-service salon in south Montgomery County finally reopened after six weeks of a state-issued closure to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
Her staff has been dutifully following public health measures, including the use of face masks. But with Montgomery County leaving reporting violations of Gov. Greg Abbott’s July 2 executive order mandating face coverings in public up to business owners, Wolfson is worried.
“I don’t think we (business owners) should be the ones who have to enforce the rules,” said the Magnolia resident. Enforcing the order “takes the burden off of the business owner to have to make that decision” of reporting violators.
The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office on July 3 said it would not enforce the governor’s order, which penalizes offenders with a $250 fine after an initial warning but no jailing.
“We encourage all citizens and business partners to take reasonable precautions in their own life to mitigate possible exposure by following all health department guidelines,” the sheriff’s office stated in regards to whether it was placing enforcement responsibility on business owners.
County Judge Mark Keough has also said Abbott’s mask order is unenforceable.
“How do you get 600,000 people to wear masks?” he said on Tuesday. “It would be a shame for us to put law enforcement in a situation to enforce something that can’t be enforced.”
Foregoing mandates
In April, Keough said the Montgomery County Attorney’s Office found no statutory or legal basis for a face mask mandate punishing those who do not comply.
“If you choose to wear a mask or face covering, I support your decision to do so. If you are a high-risk individual and you want to wear a mask while in public places, then please do. If you choose not to wear a mask, I support that decision as well,” Keough said at the time.
Local health officials — during weekday updates on COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations — have urged people to take precautions, including wearing masks, if they venture out during the pandemic.
However, Republicans in several Texas counties, including Montgomery, have voted to censure Abbott for his order requiring face coverings.
The Montgomery County Republican Executive Committee voted 40-0 to censure Abbott. In a resolution, the committee said the governor has acted with “disregard to the Texas Constitution,” pointing to the mask requirement in counties with at least 20 positive cases, limiting gatherings and the closing of bars statewide.
Legal interpretations
Some legal experts cite constitutional precedence in offering a counterpoint to Montgomery County’s decision to not enforce Abbott’s mask mandate.
A constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, Charles “Rocky” Rhodes is a 19-year The Woodlands resident. A reference to “individual liberties” in the sheriff’s office’s statement caught Rhodes’ attention.
“We are in a public health crisis and we will use this opportunity to educate our community while still respecting individual liberties,” the July 3 statement read in part.
Rhodes said the reference does not appear to apply to the U.S. Constitution as the government can exert a “compelling interest” over individual liberties to protect public health. The right of public health measures to protect a community from disease was upheld in 1905 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts. The case dealt with a mandatory smallpox vaccination program, he noted.
Public health issues
Such public health measures can be traced back to America’s founding, Rhodes said as he pointed to quarantines, embargoes and mandated sanitation measures adopted in the 1790s to thwart yellow fever outbreaks in Philadelphia, then the U.S. capital.
“The highest duty of government is to protect the citizens’ life and health,” Rhodes said.
Many laws, he continued, are based on the idea that when one’s actions harm others, one forfeits their personal freedom.
“The Constitution allows us to protect for the general welfare and to make regulations for the general welfare and (a face mask order) clearly fits along with that,” said Dr. Michael Ewer, visiting professor at the Health and Law Institute at the University of Houston Law Center.
Rhodes and Ewer point to seat belt mandates and city ordinances against smoking. Arguing personal freedoms should disregard health concerns runs counter to the philosophy of the American founders, Rhodes said.
“It’s not just you you’re putting at risk, you’re putting others at risk. And that’s where your liberties end, is when you’re risking the lives of other people who don’t get to make that choice,” Rhodes said.

Difficult to enforce
In its statement, the sheriff’s office said it could be sued if it followed Abbott’s order.
“The language included in the governor’s order could subject our agency, and Montgomery County as a whole, to civil liability as stopping someone for a face covering related issue could be construed or misconstrued as a detention,” the statement read.
Pointing to protections for law enforcement in civil cases, Rhodes said there is a “minimal or nonexistent” likelihood the sheriff’s office would have to pay monetary damages in such a suit. He also described Abbott’s order as ambiguous and said its enforcement is difficult enough to justify non-enforcement by the sheriff’s office.
“The governor seems to be wanting to bark a little bit but not bite with respect to the wearing of masks,” Rhodes said.
As a result of Abbott’s order exempting counties with 20 or fewer COVID-19 cases, 78 counties have opted out, according to a July 9 Texas Tribune article.
Montgomery County is one of four counties not exempt but which are not following Abbott’s order, the Texas Tribune noted.
The Montgomery County Public Health District this week has reported more than 2,000 active cases of COVID-19.
Fearing a shutdown
Tucked away in a sleek strip mall on Metropark Drive in Shenandoah, Martinis & Manicures offers complimentary cocktails to its clientele from its bar.
After opening in November, the beauty shop enjoyed steady foot traffic as business began to build, but languished once there was suspected social spread of COVID-19 in the Houston area.
Chrissy Wolfson was forced to furlough nearly half of her 17 employees during the closures. With COVID-19 infections at a swelling point in neighboring Harris County, she fears another series of business closures will follow and the salon will shutter permanently.
Abbott on Friday warned business closures could ensue if residents did not heed the order to wear face coverings in public.
“There’s no way we can survive a second shutdown,” Wolfson said of her salon.
