However, if altering these is judged by instructors to be necessary and appropriate, instructors may do so but are requested to share with their students in a timely manner how the course syllabi or lesson plans have changed.The university highly recommends students keep a copy of all work that they submit.  If an assignment that has been submitted to the instructor is lost, the student will be required to provide a replacement.  If the student does not have a copy of their work, it will be presumed that the work was not completed and submitted. For traditional undergraduate students, no work will be accepted after 5:00 p.m. on Friday of the last week of the semester or session.  For degree completion students, the last day to accept work is seven days after the last of class.Registrar's OfficePhone: 559-453-2037 Fax: 559-453-3676 registrar@fresno.eduPhone HoursMon - Fri: 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:00a.m. - 12:00p.m.Office HoursMon - Fri: 8:30a.m. - 5:00p.m.Summer Fri: 8:30a.m. - 12:00p.m.StudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentral
