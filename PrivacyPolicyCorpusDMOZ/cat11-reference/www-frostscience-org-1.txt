You can change your privacy settings at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information.

PII is collected to process donations and purchases, and to respond to requests for information. PII may be shared, on an as necessary basis, with third party agents and administrators who provide necessary services to the Museum.
We may also share PII with trusted business partners who we believe offer information or services which our users might be interested in.
In the event that PII is shared with such parties, we will always use appropriate measures to restrict such third parties from using your PII in any manner other than as necessary for the performance of their services and will make sure they protect your PII with appropriate measures of security.
Be advised, however, that we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties.
General (non PII) information may be used for a variety of purposes, and such information may be aggregated.
The Company reserves the right to disclose any information (including PII) in response to legal process, to establish or protect our legal rights, or as otherwise required by applicable law; if we believe such action is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; if we believe such action is necessary to protect the legal rights of the Company, any Website user, or any other appropriate party; if we believe such action is necessary to protect the general public.
We may also disclose information (including PII) in the event of any change in legal status of the Company to a successor in interest or other relevant party.
