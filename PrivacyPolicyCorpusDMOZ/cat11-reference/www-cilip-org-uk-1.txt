What are CILIP’s community guidelines?
We want to keep our platforms relevant and engaging. As such, we may occasionally hide and/or not respond to posts. Examples of these sorts of posts include:
Personal attacks or abusive messages
Spam or commercial posts
Excessively long posts which disrupt the conversation (other posts which disrupt the conversation will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis)
Comments which are off-topic or excessively repetitive
Anything that promotes discrimination based on race, sex, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age
