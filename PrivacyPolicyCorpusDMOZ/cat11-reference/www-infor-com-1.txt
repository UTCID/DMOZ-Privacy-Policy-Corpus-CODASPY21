Data Privacy at Infor
At Infor, we prioritize the user experience, leveraging data science, and easy integration of our software with our customers’ existing systems. We manage those priorities while valuing the fundamental human right to data privacy and your right to control what happens to your personal data.
We demonstrate our commitment to data privacy by giving you meaningful choices about how your data is collected and used and by providing you with information about our products and services to enable you to make informed decisions about what happens to your personal data.
We are committed to compliance with applicable data privacy laws
At Infor, we realize that you entrust us with your most sensitive assets – your business and personal data. We take that responsibility seriously.
We also believe that actions speak louder than words. That is why we are assessed regularly by third parties who evaluate our privacy practices against industry best practices and standards. As a measure of our leadership in data privacy, we have achieved GDPR Privacy Program Validation and APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules Certification.
Privacy regulations are changing
We recognize that constantly changing privacy regulations are a challenge for our customers. Here are the ways in which Infor is complying with some of the most impactful privacy regulations:
CCPA
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) came into effect on January 1, 2020. To address the requirements of CCPA, Infor offers its customers a CCPA Addendum.
