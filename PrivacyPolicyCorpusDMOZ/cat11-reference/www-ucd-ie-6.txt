UCD Services Acceptable Usage Policy - Summary
To safeguard individuals and to ensure the integrity and reliability of information services, UCD has a number of Use Policies. These are designed to ensure that the University can offer the widest possible range of services to its community.
The policies not intended to limit use of the University's information services. Nothing that follows in this document attempts to limit academic freedom as set out in the Universities Act (1997) as follows: “A member of the academic staff of a university shall have the freedom, within the law, …. to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged, or subject to less favourable treatment by the university, for the exercise of that freedom.”
Signed off by the Library & Information Technology Board on 18th November 2013 & noted by UMTA on 3rd December 2013.
