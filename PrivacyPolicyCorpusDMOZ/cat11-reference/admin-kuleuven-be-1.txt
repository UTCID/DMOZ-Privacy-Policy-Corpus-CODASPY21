KU Leuven Cookie Policy
Contents
The KU Leuven website uses cookies that facilitate navigation through our website.
What is a cookie?
Cookies are small text files that record your preferences during browsing and are saved on your own computer or device.

Cookie Settings
Use of cookies on the KU Leuven website
Changing browser settings
You can enable or delete cookies on your computer through your browser settings. The way in which this works varies from browser to browser. Consult your browser’s help function if necessary. You must always make this adjustment per browser and per computer!
Cookie-instellingen in Internet Explorer
Cookie-instellingen in Chrome
Cookie-instellingen in Firefox
Cookie-instellingen in Safari
Not accepting, disabling or deleting cookies may result in certain functionalities of the KU Leuven website being no longer accessible or not operating as expected. This may make your website experience unsatisfactory.
Social media and the corresponding plug-ins
Many social media (such as, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, etc.) receive a lot of information on your browsing habits through social plug-ins on their websites (for example by way of the Like or Share buttons).
These buttons are also to be found on the web pages of the KU Leuven.
If you want to protect yourself from these, then you are advised (by, among other agencies, the Commission for the Protection of Privacy) to take one of the steps below.
Install a browser that blocks add-on tracking. Examples of such browser add-ons are:
Privacy Badger (http://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
Ghostery (https://www.ghostery.com)
Disconnect (https://disconnect.me/disconnect)
Make use of your browser’s incognito or private navigation mode. Recent versions of the most popular browsers provide such a private navigation mode:
Internet Explorer
Firefox
Chrome
Safari
This function forces your browser to erase all tracks of your browsing activity (cookies, history, etc.) after you have closed the window and therefore protects you from being tracked by third parties (please note: this function does not make you anonymous on the web). There are also special browsers that protect privacy, such as Privacy Browser (www.epicbrowser.com).
Social media and other websites use information about the browsing activity of its users to provide them with targeted advertising. If you no longer want to be tracked by targeted advertising, you can choose to opt out of targeted advertisements via the opt-out website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (www.youronlinechoices.eu).
Opting out of targeted advertisements does not mean that information is no longer collected on your browsing activities. If you also want to protect yourself from the collection of this information, you are advised to also use the incognito mode of your browser or one of the above-mentioned browser add-ons.
Want more information?
You will find more information on the following websites: www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.com/be-nl
KU Leuven reserves the right to amend this policy at any time. You will always find the most recent version of the Cookie Statement on this page.
