As a recognized agent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the College will act in accord with the provisions of this act in the event of notification of alleged copyright infringement by any user. Instances of inappropriate use of technology resources will be referred to the appropriate official for disciplinary action by the College and will be subject to this policy as well as to other applicable College policies and guidelines. In addition, individuals may be subject to civil suit, and/or local, state, and federal prosecution depending on their actions. Among sanctions that can be imposed for violation of this or other applicable College policies, the College reserves the right to restrict an individual's access to technology resources.
