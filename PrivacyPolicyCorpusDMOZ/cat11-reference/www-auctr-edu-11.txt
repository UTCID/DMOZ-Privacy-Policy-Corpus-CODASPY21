General Policies and Procedures
The following policies are intended to facilitate the work of the faculty, students, staff and library visitors through control of the parking and movement of motor vehicles while on the property of the Robert W. Woodruff Library of the Atlanta University Center.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Robert W. Woodruff Library (RWWL) or designee is empowered to create, modify, or preempt parking in controlled areas of the Library's parking facility. The operation of a motor vehicle on the RWWL property is a granted privilege and is not an inherent right of any faculty/staff member, student or visitor.
Any motorized vehicle operated on the property of RWWL is subject to all policies governing parking at the facility located at 111 James P. Brawley Drive, SW Atlanta, GA 30314. Any parking area reserved or modified for specific library usage shall be posted with appropriate signs stating the type of permit or restrictions pertaining to the use of the area, or restricted by manual control.
Guidelines for RWWL Parking Lot
1. Enforcement of RWWL parking lot fees and regulations is in effect from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. There is no charge for parking after 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and on weekends. The parking schedule may be altered to accommodate special events or holiday periods.
2. All visitor vehicles must be removed from RWWL’s parking facility at Library’s closing. Vehicles left overnight are subject to impound and will be issued a tow warning.*
3. Upon entering the RWWL Parking Lot at the Milton entrance, driver will proceed to an upper level numbered parking space.
4. Driver will note the numbered parking space and proceed to the Parking Pay Station and follow directions.
5. Once the parking ticket has been dispensed from the Parking Pay Station, the driver must return to their parked vehicle and place the parking ticket in the front windshield so that it is easily visible.
6. Parking Pay Station parking tickets can only be used for the noted space number.
7. Specific parking spaces are reserved for the physically disabled and are marked by signs. Parking is by special permit only and enforced twenty-four hours a day.
8. Fliers or advertisements cannot be distributed or posted on vehicles or in any areas of the parking lot. Conducting business and/or commercial services is prohibited on library property.
9. Firearms or concealed weapons are not allowed in the parking facility.
10. Persons using the Loading Zones must not exceed 30 minutes duration and must leave the vehicle’s flashers on. Consult with Security Services for unusual circumstances.

12. Persons found possessing a parking permit that was not issued to them, per RWWL records, will be in violation of policy and will have the parking permit confiscated. The parking privileges of the authorized permit holder will be placed under review for possible revocation.
* Contact must be made with Security Services within 24 hours of the issuance of a warning. If contact is not made within twenty-four (24) hours of tow warning, the vehicle will be towed and impounded. All wheel lock and/or tow fee expenses will be the sole responsibility of the vehicle owner or designee.
