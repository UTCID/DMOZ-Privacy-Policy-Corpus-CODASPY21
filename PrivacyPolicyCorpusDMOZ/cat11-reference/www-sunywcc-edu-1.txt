Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by the user’s browser on the hard drive of your computer. www.sunywcc.edu does not use cookies.
Use of E-Mail
In spite of the good intentions of the college to respect the privacy of individuals, it should be understood that it is impossible to assure the privacy of e-mail. Not only may email be sent to someone other than the intended recipient (either through mis-addressing or forwarding), but email sent as plain text may also be intercepted as it travels over the network
The use of College resources, including computing and networking equipment and services, purchased with College funds, are intended for college business. While it is not the intention of the College to actively monitor communications or files stored or transmitted on College systems or devices, individuals must understand that under certain circumstances they may not have a right to privacy to such information. Such circumstances include but are not limited to:
compliance with legal requirements or process;
as part of an investigation of a suspected violation of law
regulation or College policy; to maintain the integrity of the College’s computing systems.
Freedom of Information Requests
Under the “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)”, except as otherwise provided by federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file are considered public records and are subject to inspection by members of the public. As a member of the College community, your email and any information collected in the course of visiting a web site are considered public records and may be subject to Freedom of Information disclosure. In some cases email messages about students may fall under the FERPA definition of ‘education records’ and therefore be subject to the provisions of FERPA regarding the release of the information and the student’s right to inspect and review the information.
