Once you're logged in, search Quick Search for the book(s) you want. When you find a book you want, open the book's record by clicking its title.  Find the Request Options area of the record and choose the Request link. In the popup window that appears, choose your Pickup Location (Design, Parks, or Vet Med), and click the Request link. Done!  For more information including when you can pick up your items, see More details3.

You may wish to contact us before your evening or weekend visit for more assistance. HathiTrust Print Disabilities AccessISU Library is now a partner in HathiTrust's Print Disabilities Access service, which allows ISU community members who have verified print disabilities to request digital files of in-copyright material in HathiTrust be sent to them for use with assistive technology. HathiTrust is a digital library with more than 15 million full-text books, journals, and other material. Their collections include public domain open access material (available to everyone) and in-copyright materials. The in-copyright materials are available only to patrons at the university that contributed that specific item to HathiTrust. However, the Print Disabilities Access service allows eligible patrons with print disabilities to access ALL materials in HathiTrust.HathiTrust defines "eligible patrons" as "an affiliated user at a Supporting Institution who has a print disability for which access to digital copies of library books is a reasonable and appropriate accommodation."HathiTrust requires that a patron's eligibility be verified by the institution before any in-copyright materials can be downloaded for use by the patron.HathiTrust defines "print disability" as "a visual impairment, learning disability, physical disability, or other disability - that impedes a person's ability to access print in the standard way."How do I participate?  All materials in HathiTrust are full-text, but in-copyright materials are available only to the university that contributed that specific item to HathiTrust. This means their full-text will not be available to patrons at other universities. When you find in-copyright material of interest within HathiTrust and which ISU did not contribute (i.e., the full-text is not available within HathiTrust for ISU), eligible patrons may login to ILLiad, ISU Library's interlibrary loan service. Fill in the information for the in-copyright item you want. At the bottom of the request form, find the "HathiTrust Print Disability access requested" statement and select YES. Submit your request. Library staff will need to verify your eligibility by contacting ISU Student Accessibility Services staff for students or University HR staff for faculty and staff. If you do not wish to disclose your disability or have it verified through these ISU disability services channels, you will not be able to make use of HathiTrust's Print Disabilities Access service. After verification, Library staff will download the files and deliver them to you, again through ILLiad. These copyrighted files are for your use only and should not be shared, posted, or stored for anyone else's use.  This service is available only to verified eligible patrons - see "Definitions" above.How to search HathiTrust and how to request Print Disability AccessHathiTrust is a huge repository of more than 15 million digitized books, journals, and other resources. Please read our brief documentation on how to search HathiTrust effectively, and how to use ISU Library's ILLiad software to make a Print Disability Access request. Our documentation file is formatted as an accessible PDF.If you need assistance searching HathiTrust, please contact Susan Vega García at savega@iastate.edu.If you need assistance with ILLiad, please contact Resource Sharing staff at borrdesk@iastate.edu or phone 515 294-8073.Lower Distraction FurnitureNeed less visual distraction or more sense of privacy?
