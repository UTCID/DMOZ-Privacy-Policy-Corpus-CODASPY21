Program Goals
The paralegal studies program at UC Clermont is designed to educate and prepare students to work with a legal team and perform tasks which, but for the paralegal, would likely have been performed by the supervising attorney. Our graduates enhance the quality, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the delivery of legal services.
Graduates of our paralegal studies program will be able to—
Demonstrate workplace readiness skills, including basic skills in legal research and writing, and various substantive areas of the law, including, litigation, contracts, tort law, administrative litigation and corporate law.
Analyze and evaluate the law, modify standardized documents, pleading and utilize a legal database to research and create appropriate work product.
Demonstrate proficiency with legal software and other technology used in the practice of law.
Demonstrate knowledge of legal and ethical principles that guide paralegal conduct and demonstrate an understanding of the role of the paralegal in the delivery of legal services.
