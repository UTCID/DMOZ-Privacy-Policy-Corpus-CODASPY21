The Vermont State Colleges (VSC) are committed to preserving and maintaining the privacy of visitors to VSC websites. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the VSC websites. By visiting any of the VSC websites, you are accepting the practices described in this statement.
Information Gathering
We use your Internet domain and the Internet address of the computer you are using, the type of browser and operating system you are using, and the date and time of access to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We identify which parts of our sites are most heavily used, and which portion of our audience comes from within and outside of the VSC network.
Some of the Vermont State Colleges use Google Analytics to monitor traffic on websites. Google Analytics places “cookies,” on your computer to help us analyze how visitors use our site so we can improve its usefulness.
Other information is collected only if you choose to send it. For example you may complete an online form, make an online purchase, or send an email.
Use of Information
The VSC uses the information we collect to tailor site content to user needs, to generate aggregate statistical reports, to help diagnose problems and otherwise to administer our websites. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual computer Internet address.
Information you choose to send on our sites is used to complete transactions (such as registering for a course or sending an email).
The VSC may employ independent contractors to help manage web-based services, and such contractors may have access to data similar to the access we give our employees. In such instances, we take precautions to protect against re-disclosure of personal information.
Security
This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.
VSC websites contain links to other independently run websites outside the domains of the VSC websites. The VSC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, you can contact:
