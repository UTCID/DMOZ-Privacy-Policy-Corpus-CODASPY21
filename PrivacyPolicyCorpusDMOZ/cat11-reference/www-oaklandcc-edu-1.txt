Demographic information.
Personally identifiable information, voluntarily submitted to oaklandcc.edu, such

How Information Is Used
Personal information may be used for educational programs (e.g., recruitment or admission),
administrative purposes (e.g., employment), university engagement (e.g., attending
a university sponsored event), or contacting students, alumni or donors, or any other
purpose related to College business.
Information about user visits to the College’s webpage is used to monitor and improve
the College’s website performance, revise content, and market to prospective students
and others.
With Whom This Information Will Be Shared
The College does not sell or rent personal information. The College may, however,
share personal information in limited circumstances, such as with service providers
that support business activities. The College requires service providers to keep personal
information secure and does not allow service providers to use or share personal information
for any purpose other than providing services on the College’s behalf.
The College may also share personal information upon written request and receipt of
a signed release, when required by law, or when the College determines sharing will
help to protect the safety, property, or rights of the College, members of the community,
and guests.
Cookies
The College uses cookies, which are small pieces of information sent to a browser
by a website visited by the user. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable
information. Cookies are used to track usage patterns, traffic trends and customer
behavior, as well as to record other information from the website. Many content adjustments
and customer service improvements are made based on the data derived from cookies.
Information that the College collects from cookies will not be used to create profiles
of users and will only be used in aggregate form.
Social Media Plugins
Some of the pages on the College’s website have embedded social media sharing buttons.
Social media platforms use cookies or other tracking technologies when a button is
embedded on the website. The College does not have access to, or control of, any information
collected through these buttons. The social media platforms are responsible for how
they use information. For specific privacy controls on how these buttons track how
users access our website, see the cookies policies of Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest,
LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube.
Web Beacons
A "tracking pixel" (sometimes called "web beacons", "transparent GIFs", "clear GIFs",
"pixel gifs", or "pixel tags") is a tiny, invisible image that allows the College
to track activities based on pages visited. Tracking pixels redeliver advertising
and notifications through third party vendors. No personally identifiable information
is collected through these retargeting services, and the College does not sell or
rent the information collected through tracking pixels. Information collected through
tracking pixels can only be shared with third parties in aggregated form and in accordance
with the College's privacy policy.
Offsite Links
Links to non-College organizations are provided solely as a service to users. The
College is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of external web links.
How Information Is Secured
Although no computer system is 100 percent secure, the College has deployed extensive
security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information
under its control. Concern about the accuracy of information contained in personal
records should be directed to the custodian of the record, which is typically the
department that collects and maintains the information. For example, contact Enrollment
Services about information collected through the Web application for admission.
Perkins and WIOA Acts
In order to improve instruction offered by the College and to meet the requirements
of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, 20 USC 2323 (“Perkins”),
and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 USC 2842 (“WIOA”), the College
uses Social Security Numbers (“SSN”) in order to compile summary reports. Both Perkins
and WIOA require the College and the State of Michigan to assess the effectiveness
of vocational and technical education programs aimed at training, placement and retention
of students in employment. Although these laws require that performance reports be
compiled based on wage record information, neither law requires students to give their
SSN to the College.
The College uses SSNs in order to gain access to individual wage records and compile
required Perkins and WIOA reports. These reports assist the College to improve vocational
and technical education programs. By improving programs, the College will be better
able to serve both employers and employees. Wage record information is confidentially
maintained, based on SSNs, by the State of Michigan.
Neither the College nor the State of Michigan will disclose SSNs or wage record data
to any person or entity unless legally permitted or required to do so. Any personally
identifying wage record data will be destroyed by the College as soon as all required
statistical analysis has been performed, or when the information is no longer needed,
which ever date comes first.
Who to Contact with Questions or Concerns
Any concerns or questions how personal data is used should be addressed to the OCC
Webmaster at webmaster@oaklandcc.edu.
The College will attempt to respond promptly to all requests and make reasonable best
efforts to help with concerns. Complaints regarding concerns not appropriately addressed
may be directed to the local data protection authority. Individuals also have the
right to submit a complaint in the state of residence or place of work of potential
violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
FOR PERSONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (“EU”)
To the extent individuals in the EU provide personal information to the College, the
processing of that information may fall under the GDPR.
Personal information will be processed for legal purposes in the context for which
the information was collected or provided.
The College recognizes the rights of EU residents under the GDPR to access data, ask
for erasure, correction, restriction, portability of information, and object to the
processing of information covered by
the GDPR.
Personal data will be maintained as long as necessary to satisfy the purposes for
which it was collected and processed, and as otherwise required by law. The College
will strive to provide the safeguards required by GDPR for information transferred
from the EU to the College.
