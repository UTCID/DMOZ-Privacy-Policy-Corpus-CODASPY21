does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following
information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address
is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol address to direct Internet

service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);
The type of browser and operating system you used;
The date and time you visited this site;
The web pages or services you accessed at this site.
The website you visited prior to coming to this website, if you clicked on a link

The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by Clark College
only to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people
are using our services. Clark College analyzes this information (the Web site logs)

Information volunteered in response to a survey.
Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose.
The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio,
video, and graphic information formats you send us.
We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address
issues you may identify, to further improve our Web site, or to forward the e-mail
to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for research
and enhancement purposes. Information from other on-line forms is used to fulfill
student requests for information and/or services.
Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable
to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's
name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not
considered personal information.You may choose whether to provide personal information
on-line.
We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to
us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an on-line form.
You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide
any personal information using an on-line form. Your choice to not participate in
these activities will not impair your ability to browse www.clark.edu and read or
download any information provided on the site.
If you choose not to use e-mail, participate in a survey or use an on-line form, you
will be provided with alternative contact methods.
If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state
law and the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information
is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and
copying if not protected by federal or state law.

what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Registrar as shown in the Agency
Contact Information section of this statement.
The Clark College Web site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect
any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of
personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail
will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public
access.
Public Access to Information
All of the information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject
to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
RCW 42.17. 260(1) states thatIn the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open
and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed
by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right
to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.
Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.
Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection
and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions
of subsection (6) of this section (RCW 42.17.260(6)), RCW 42.56.210, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or
records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy
interests protected by RCW 42.56.210 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.56.210 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the
justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.
