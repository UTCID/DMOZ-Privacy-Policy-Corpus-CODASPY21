Overview
Thank you for visiting the website of the NYS Education Department (NYSED).

Please note that NYSED may, at its sole discretion, change modify, add, or delete portions of this policy. This privacy policy only applies to this website so you should examine the privacy policy of any website, including other State websites, that you access through this website.
For purposes of this policy, “personal information” means any information concerning a natural person which, because of name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person.

The information that is collected automatically is used to improve the website's content, to help NYSED understand how users interact with the website, and to help make the site more user-friendly. It is also used for statistical analysis to determine what information is of most and of least interest to our visitors, and to identify system performance or problem areas. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and NYSED does not sell or distribute the information collected from the website for commercial marketing purposes. This information is purged from NYSED’s database after six months.

Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser to provide a means of distinguishing among users of this website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. In order to better serve you, we may use "temporary" cookies to enhance, customize or enable your visit to this web site. Temporary cookies do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security and are erased during the operation of your browser or when your browser is closed. NYSED does not use “persistent” cookies on this site. Persistent cookies are stored on a user’s computer hard drive to allow the website to recognize the user the next time the user visits the site and tailor the information presented to the user’s interests. The software you use to access the website allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting these cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some of the features of this website.
Information Collected When You Email this Website or Initiate an Online Transaction through this Website
If during your visit to this website you send an email to NYSED, your email address and the contents of your email will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us. The information is retained in accordance with the public record retention provisions in the State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. Your email address and the information contained in your email will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve this website, or to forward your email to another agency for appropriate action. Your email address is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and NYSED does not sell or distribute your email address for commercial marketing purposes.
If you initiate a transaction such as completing a survey, registration or other form while on this website, the information, including personal information, volunteered by you in initiating the transaction is used by NYSED to operate NYSED programs, which include the provision of goods, services and information. The information collected by NYSED may be disclosed by NYSED for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted by you.
Payment Card Information
If you initiate a payment card transaction through an online application on this website, NYSED provides a data entry screen that securely transmits your data directly to a third-party Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant payment card service provider. NYSED does not receive or retain any of your personal information, payment card or account information. The payment card service provider transmits only a successful or unsuccessful confirmation message back to NYSED so that NYSED can properly complete the transaction. For more information about PCI compliance, visit the PCI Security Standards Council website.
General Information about Children’s Online Privacy
NYSED does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information provided by any individual in an email or through an online transaction will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. NYSED encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information on-line.
NYSED does not solicit information from children under the age of thirteen. If the NYSED receives information submitted by children under the age of thirteen, those communications are accorded the same protections as if the information had been submitted offline.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) imposes restrictions on commercial Websites, not government agency websites. Although COPPA does not apply to the NYSED Website, the NYSED practices are consistent with its mandates. If you would like more information about COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's official COPPA page.
Student Data Privacy
NYSED is committed to promoting sound information practices and policies that will ensure the security and privacy of student data. For additional information, please visit our Student Data Privacy website.

You may choose not to send us an e-mail, respond to a survey or complete an order form. While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific services or products through this website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or products from NYSED by other means such as by regular mail or telephone, and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the website, including browsing or downloading most publicly available information.
