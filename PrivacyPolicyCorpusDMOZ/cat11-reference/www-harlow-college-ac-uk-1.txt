Gender Pay Gap Reporting Statement
Posted in College Policies
The College is committed to addressing workplace barriers to equality and providing all employee’s with equality of opportunity.
Under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 we are required to report on our Gender Pay Gap.
This involves carrying out six calculations that show the difference between the average earnings of our male and female employees across our organisation, regardless of role or seniority.
The statistics used in these calculations are based on our workforce profile as of 31 March 2018.
We can use these results to assess:
the levels of gender equality in our workplace
the balance of male and female employees at different levels
how effectively talent is being maximised and rewarded
The challenge in our organisation and across Great Britain is to eliminate any gender pay gaps.
