NONDISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES
Educational institutions receiving federal financial assistance are required to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These federal laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender, including sexual harassment and sexual violence; sexual orientation; genetic information; race; color; religion; national origin; age; veteran status; and disability in the education programs and activities that they operate. International Business College is subject to these laws and complies fully with them in the enrollment of students, the hiring of faculty and staff, and in all other activities of the college. The Director of Education, who is identified in the Administration, Faculty, and Staff section of this catalog and who may be reached at 317-813-2300, is the Title IX coordinator at International Business College. Questions regarding Title IX may be referred to the Title IX coordinator or to the U.S Department of Education Office of Civil Rights. Students, faculty, and administrative employees are encouraged to bring any complaints or reports of discrimination to the coordinator’s attention. The matter will be investigated promptly, and both parties will be notified in writing about the outcome of the complaint. Appropriate follow-up will be implemented to assure that no person associated with the college is subjected to unlawful discrimination. Individuals who report discrimination will not be subjected to any retaliation for doing so.
