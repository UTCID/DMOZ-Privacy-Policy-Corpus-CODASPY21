How the information is used

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, provides students access to information about themselves, permits students to challenge such information about themselves, and limits the release of such information about students without the student’s explicit written consent.
LCCC is committed to this Act in its entirety. Procedural guidelines are available by clicking here, in appropriate College publications, and copies of procedures may be obtained from the Records Office.
Access to student records
A student’s record, with certain exceptions including directory information (see below), will not be released without prior written consent of the student. A student has the right to review and question the content of her/his educational record within a reasonable time (45 days) after making a written request for such a review. If there are any questions as to the accuracy or appropriateness of the record that cannot be resolved informally, an opportunity for a hearing on the matter will be provided.
Disclosure of education records
LCCC will disclose information from a student’s educational records only with the written consent of the student, except:
To school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records
To certain officials of the U.S. Department of Education, the comptroller general, and state and local educational authorities, in connection with certain state or federally supported education programs
In connection with a student’s request for or receipt of financial aid, as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid
If required by a state law requiring disclosure that was adopted before November 19, 1974
To organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the College
To accrediting organizations to carry out their functions
To comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena
To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency
Directory information
LCCC designates certain personally identifiable information that is contained within the student’s education record as “directory information” so that the College may, at its discretion, disclose this information without a student’s prior written consent. This information is student name, home address and telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities, current enrollment status (including dates of attendance, full or part time, withdrawal status). A student may restrict the publication and release of this directory information by filing a written request with the Records Office.
In addition, the following information is always considered releasable: previous dates of attendance, degrees and awards received (to include honors), previous educational agencies or institutions attended. The complete policy regarding the collection, retention and dissemination of information about a student is available in the Records Office.
