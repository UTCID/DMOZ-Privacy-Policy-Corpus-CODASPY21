What information do we collect and how is it used?
Student Application Data
Your participation in Scholarship America’s programs is voluntary and you may choose whether to participate. To be considered for a scholarship, emergency grant, tuition assistance or other award administered by Scholarship America, you may be required to submit data electronically so that we may review and consider your application in order to select award recipients. By submitting an application, you consent to the processing of your personal information by Scholarship America and the organization sponsoring the program for the purpose of reviewing and considering applications and selecting award recipients.
Types of personally identifiable information may include, but are not limited to:
full name
address
email address and phone numbers
your parent(s) full name(s), address(es), email address(es) and phone number(s)
gender
ethnicity
academic information
current and future enrollment information
involvement in work, school and community activities
personal essays
birthdate
In some cases, you and/or a parent’s social security number and personal or household financial information may be requested. Actual information we collect varies based on the program being administered.
Scholarship America processes your personal information only for the purpose for which it was collected in accordance with contractual program parameters and this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to administer a program or provide a service.
When you create an application account, data you enter during the application process is automatically saved for your convenience. Even if the application is abandoned or not submitted, the information you provide is collected and is subject to this policy. Once data is entered, it becomes the property of Scholarship America.
Data is stored and processed at Scholarship America locations in the United States and potentially at sponsor sites or research partner sites. Program guidelines will identify if data will be stored or processed by the sponsor. Scholarship America is not responsible for the use, processing, and security of information once it is in the care or control of a program sponsor or their designated entity as specified by the program. We encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of those organizations to learn more about their privacy practices. We may use your contact information to confirm receipt of your application, to gather more information if there are questions regarding your application, to send you notifications regarding your status, or for communication necessary to administer a program or provide a service. When you send email or other communications electronically, Scholarship America may retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your request or question and improve our services.
No personal data will be shared with third parties without your explicit choice (opt in) with the exception of research partners and the organization sponsoring the program who will act as the data controller with respect to that program. If data is shared with a sponsor, during the application process you will be told what data will be shared with the sponsor, how and for what purpose the sponsor will process the data and given access to the sponsor’s privacy policy.
All data is subject to use in Scholarship America research and may be shared with research partners who will use it only for research purposes.
Donor Data
Scholarship America is committed to the privacy and security of both online and offline donors. All donors to Scholarship America provide certain personal information which may include names, contact information and financial data. We protect this information in a variety of ways.
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, share or trade donor information with any other entity and we will not send mailings to our donors on behalf of other organizations unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.
In cases where donations are processed through a third-party service provider, donor information will only be used as necessary to process the donation. All processing of payments and related information, including by third party service providers, is protected by industry standard safeguards.

How does Scholarship America SECURE my personal information?
We use commercially reasonable physical, technological, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure.

Some of the information you may enter on our Sites may be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), 256 bit encryption services, which are enabled by a reputable SSL certificate provider (e.g., Thawte or Verisign). Pages utilizing this technology will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
In the event that your data has been accessed by an unauthorized individual, you will be notified as required by law.
