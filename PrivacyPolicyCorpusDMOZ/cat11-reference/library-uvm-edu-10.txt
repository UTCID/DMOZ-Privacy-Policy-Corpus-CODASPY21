UVM students, faculty, and staff may schedule one-on-one research appointments with a Howe librarian. Research appointments provide an opportunity to work on in-depth research questions and issues one-on-one (or with a small group working on a project together).
Choose the librarian who matches the subject area you are doing work in and then follow the provided link to Make or Request an Appointment.
If you're not sure which librarian to choose contact the Howe Library Reference Desk and we'll help get you in touch with the right person.
