Solihull College’s Privacy Policy
Solihull College is committed to protecting you and your personal information. This page answers some important questions about how our website collects, uses and protects your personal details.
What information does the College collect about me?
When you visit the Solihull College website we sometimes receive personal information from you. For example, if you enquire about a course or apply for a vacancy you will need to tell us who you are and how we can contact you.
In addition, as you browse our website we gather some basic data such as which pages you have visited, which we use for statistical analysis – this does not include any personal information. This basic data is passed to Google to allow us to analyse how visitors use our website, which helps us to improve the site.
Cookies
Some websites put a cookie on your computer so that they can remember something about you for that visit or for a later time. They are not computer programmes and cannot contain viruses.
We use three types of cookies on our website:
Social media cookies
Occasionally, we embed video content from websites including YouTube, or social networking content from Facebook and Twitter. As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from social media sites they may place cookies on your computer as well.
You can change your cookie settings at any time, this page explains how to do this:
www.aboutcookies.org
Analytics cookies
We use Google Analytics to anonymously track statistics about who uses our website. This data allows us to count the number of visitors we get and which pages they visit. This helps us improve the way our website works for visitors, for example, ensuring you find the information you’re looking for easily. The visitor information is sent to our Google analytics account via Google.
You can change your cookie settings at any time, this page explains how to do this:
www.aboutcookies.org
Google Analytics Advertising Features
In addition to Google Analytics, Google Signals compiles for us multi-platform data reports on Google users that have enabled personalised advertising in their Google accounts. If you have enabled personalised advertising in your Google account, Google will be able to prepare data models and reports on website habits, which show for instance on which device you first clicked on an advertisement, on which device any eventual course application took place, your location, search history, YouTube history and data from sites that partner with Google. These data models and reports are based on random samples and are pseudonymised to ensure anonymity, which means that we are unable to draw and conclusions to the identities of the individual Google users.
Users can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through their Google Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on and the National Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out facility.
Other cookies we use
We use a cookie to identify which website requests belong to which visitor. This means that when you apply for a course online the cookie remembers your application. This information is not passed on to anyone.
You can change your cookie settings at any time, this page explains how to do this:
www.aboutcookies.org
If cookies are disabled the website will perform functionally as before, but our statistics will be less accurate. This means we will not be able to make the information you require as accessible.
