FERPA/Privacy
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, is  a federal law that protects the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiable  information contained within student education records. The University of  Kentucky complies with FERPA's confidentiality protections and adheres to  procedures dealing with student education records and directory information  recommended by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and  Admissions Officers. This law applies to K-12 as well as postsecondary education.
What are education records?
Records — handwriting, print, computer, videotape, audiotape, film, microfilm, microfiche, or e-mail — of an institution that
Contain information directly related to the student and
Are maintained by an agency or institution or party acting in its behalf.
Education records do not include:
Records/notes in sole possession of maker not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute
Medical records
Employment records when employment is not contingent on being a student, provided the record is used only in relation to the individual's employment
Records created and maintained by a law enforcement unit used only for that purpose, is revealed only to law enforcement agencies of the same jurisdiction, and the enforcement unit does not have access to education records
Information on a person that was obtained when no longer a student (i.e., alumni records) and does not relate to the person as a student
Consent for Release of Information on Academic Record and Progress
If you would like your parent or guardian to access information about your academic record and progress, download the Consent for Release form, complete it and submit it to the appropriate office with government issued photo ID that includes your signature.

Address
Telephone listings
E-mail address

Bulletin
Registrar's website
“Directory information” may be made available, without the student's consent, through a variety of ways, including but not limited to the following media:
The University's online directory
Telephone or written responses to requests from external/third parties including but not limited to potential employers and/or scholarship agencies
Announcements released by the Office of University Relations to newspapers in particular students' hometown newspapers
Announcement of official graduations, which occur at the completion of each semester or ter
Annual FERPA Notification Deadline
In order to prevent the “directory information” items listed above from appearing in the University's annual printed telephone directory, students must file a “Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information” (see below) at the time of the annual FERPA notification or by the 15th day of September (or three weeks into the term) during the Fall term. Requests filed after the Fall term deadline may not prevent designated “directory information” from appearing in telephone directories sponsored by the university.
The University of Kentucky assumes that a student's failure specifically to request blocking access to any element of “directory information” constitutes approval for disclosure. To prevent the University from disclosing any “directory information” to third parties, students must sign and file a “Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information” (see below) with the University Registrar, Room 10 Funkhouser Building.
Such requests may be filed at the time of the annual FERPA notification or at any other time during an academic year. The request to prevent disclosure of “directory information” will remain in effect permanently, including after departure from the University, unless subsequently changed by the student. At the time of graduation, students will be given another opportunity to release such “information hold.”
To Add a Privacy Flag
To withhold disclosure, a student must:
Complete a FERPA Privacy Flag - Add/Remove Form. The form may be submitted at any time throughout the year and will go into effect immediately, and
Present a photo ID in person to the Registrar's Office, Student Records, Room 10 Funkhouser Building.
This suppresses the student's “directory information,” which prohibits the institution from supplying the requested information. The Privacy Flag prohibits the University of Kentucky from releasing any information regarding a student's status at the institution. This notation will appear on the record until the student has initiated a request for removal.
Please Note:
If you request a Privacy Flag be placed on your record, then the University cannot acknowledge the fact of your enrollment to anyone who requests verification of enrollment. This would include deferring loan repayments or inquiries from a prospective employer. Please keep this in mind when requesting that a Privacy Flag be placed on your record. If you have any questions, please contact the Student Records Office at (859) 257-7157.
To Remove a Privacy Flag
To remove the privacy request, the student is required to:
Complete a FERPA Privacy Flag - Add/Remove Form. The form may be submitted at any time throughout the year and will go into effect immediately, and
Present a photo ID in person to the Registrar's Office, Student Records, Room 10 Funkhouser Building.
If you have any questions, please contact the Student Records Office at (859) 257-.
Notification of Rights Under FERPA For Postsecondary Institutions
This wording is borrowed from the printed edition of the UK Bulletin.) The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their eduction records.
They are:
1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
4. Upon request, the University discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. [Note: FERPA requires an institution to make a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the records request unless the institution states in its annual notification that it intends to forward records on request. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University of Kentucky to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance Office
U.S. Department of Education
400 Maryland Avenue, SW
Washington, DC, 20202-4605
The University may release information without the student's consent where the information is classified as "Directory information." The following categories of information have been designated by the University as directory information: name, address, telephone listing, e-mail address, place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, full-time/part-time status,** and the most recent previous educational institution attended by the student. Students who do not wish such information released without their consent should notify the Student Records Office in writing and follow the procedures listed here.
