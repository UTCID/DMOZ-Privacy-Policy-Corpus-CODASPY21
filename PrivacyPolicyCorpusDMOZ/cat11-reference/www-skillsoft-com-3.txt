These rules are binding company policies. Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, so their processing of your personal data will necessarily involve a transfer of data outside the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the European Union.Skillsoft Limited’s wholly-owned U.S.-based subsidiaries Skillsoft Corporation and SumTotal Systems, LLC (collectively, Skillsoft) participate in and have certified compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

Your Rights in Your Personal DataUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. If you wish to exercise any of these rights set out below, please fill-out our form and help us help you by specifying which right(s) outlined below you are asserting.Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.Request transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.As noted elsewhere in this privacy notice, if you are using any Skillsoft Business Services, please contact your employer with any questions or requests related to your personal information.It follows that we are only able to act on requests related to the personal information that we have collected through our website(s). If we cannot act on your request, we will explain the reason(s) why. For example, a request might impact the rights of another person or another company.No Fee Usually RequiredYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request for these or other legitimate reasons.What We May Need From YouWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.Time Limit To RespondWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of our receiving them. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.Rights for California ResidentsCertain rights outlined above may be available to you if you reside in California. Please review our California Privacy Notice to learn more about your rights and how to exercise them.11.
