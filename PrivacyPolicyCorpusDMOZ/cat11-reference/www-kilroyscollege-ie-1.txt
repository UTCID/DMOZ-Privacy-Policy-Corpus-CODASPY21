Your information will be kept in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted on a 'need to know' basis only.
When you purchase certain products and services from Kilroy's College we may send you confirmation emails; these may also include marketing which we consider may be of interest to you.

Complaints and queries
Kilroy's College strives to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. For this reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously. We therefore encourage people to bring it to our attention if they think our collection or use of personal information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate.
Disclosure of personal information
In the vast majority of cases we will not disclose your personal information to others unless we have previously gained your consent. However, there will be circumstances where we may disclose your personal information without your consent, e.g. where we are required by law to disclose information or where the information is required to prevent or detect a crime. In the case of all disclosures we will always ensure the disclosure is legitimate and proportionate for the purpose.
