Alumni Directory
We maintain an Alumni Directory for the convenience of web site visitors. This directory mainly contains the public graduate lists which are published each year in the local newspaper, grad programmes and yearbooks. We receive updates of mailing addresses and contact information from Alumni in person at reunions, over the phone, and also through electronic submission on our web site. We review information that is submitted electronically, and will send you a confirmation e-mail (if you have provided an e-mail address) that contains the information we have for you on file.
Contact information is always private and is never displayed publicly. Web site visitors have the option to send a message to a single e-mail address specified as the "primary e-mail address". This message is subject to approval by web site staff before being forwarded to prevent spam and other abuse messages from going through.
We use your contact information that you submit to us to mail out free newsletters on a yearly basis (if desired) and to notify you of upcoming reunion events for your class. We may provide this contact information at our discretion to organizers planning reunion events for your year, under the agreement that they will only use this information to notify you about the upcoming events.
For all class years for 2004 and later, grad photos are posted after graduation. These photos are generally the same as the photos appearing on the composites inside the school building as well as in the yearbook. We optionally allow alumni from other years to submit photos of themselves to be posted on our web site.

Public Display of Student Names
Student names are routinely published in our news articles and other content in relation to school activities. To protect the privacy of students, the identities of current students appearing in photos are generally not disclosed. Exceptions may be made by listing in arbitrary order the names of multiple students appearing in a particular photo. Exceptions may also be made if the student's name appears with their photo in a newspaper article or other public document, or if the student specifically grants permission to display their name with their photo on our web site.

Student Tracker
Our Student Tracker allows students to access personalized information relating to their school activities including, but not necessarily limited to, homeroom lists, debts owed, activity points and grad writeups. This information is secured by login using last name and student number. This information is never provided publicly and is only released to students as a convenience. The information may be updated periodically by school staff. Despite the name, the Student Tracker does not provide any sort of student tracking service beyond what is described here.
