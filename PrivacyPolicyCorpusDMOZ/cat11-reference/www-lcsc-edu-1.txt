Privacy Statement
This Privacy Notice discloses the privacy practices for the main Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) website (www.lcsc.edu). Please note that LCSC units and affiliates may have separate privacy policies. By using this website, you are consenting to LCSC’s collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
What information do we gather about you?
We and our third-party vendors collect certain information regarding your use of www.lcsc.edu, such as your IP address and browser type. Your session and the pages you visit on the LCSC website will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. We may use your IP address to identify the general geographic area from which you are accessing LCSC.edu. We connect data from different systems but do not link IP addresses to any personal information. We may also collect other information as described in this policy.
How do we use your information?
We use the information we gather from you for providing educational services, systems administration purposes, abuse prevention, to track user trends, and for the other purposes described in this policy. If you send us an email, the email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. We will not share, sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use your email address for commercial purposes without your permission.
User information may be shared with third-party vendors to the extent necessary to provide and improve web services or other communications to users.  We also provide information to third parties who are contracted by the college to perform services on behalf of or in concert with the college.  For example, we use third parties such as Google Analytics to generate reports on site usage, web traffic, user behavior, and user interests in order to optimize LCSC’s website for our visitors. We also use geographic, demographic, and interest-based reports of our website visitors to create custom audience lists. We prohibit any third parties who receive user information for this purpose from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services for the benefit of our users.
We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect our rights and safety and the rights and safety of our users or others.
How is this information collected and how can you opt out?
Google and other third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from this website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. For more information on Google Analytics, consult their terms of use, privacy practices, and ads settings. You can opt out of the collection and use of this information through tools like the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. You may disable cookies through your individual browser options or you can opt out of the collection and use of this information through tools like the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
