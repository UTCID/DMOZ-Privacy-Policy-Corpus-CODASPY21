Our Service Providers. We share personal information with companies and organizations, including subsidiaries and other business entities controlled by Axiell, that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide website support services to us. For some of these services (like the public social networks), we leverage their services for our social accounts connected to Axiell. The management of personal data is related to how the service themselves manage the data.
Change added on 4 May 2018
We’re now taking this opportunity to update the our Terms of Service and European Privacy Policy which outline the rules for using Axiell Websites and our relationship with you. If you are located in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Privacy Policy applies to you.
The updates are part of our work to comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation. These updates help you better understand how we collect and manage your data. As of 25 May 2018, you will be given the opportunity to more easily control your data and how it is being used.
The updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy go into effect on 25 May 2018. If you continue to use any of Axiell Websites on or after 25 May 2018, you are agreeing to the updated Terms of Service and our use of your data as set out in our Privacy Policy. If you don’t want the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to apply to you, you can click the button to decline using cookies and will be directed to a light version of our website with limited functionality and limited information.
We are making it easier for you to control the cookies being used and stored and will have the option to only submit certain cookies by changing our cookie consent forms and you now have direct access to which cookies are being used.
We have added IP-Adress as a type of “Personal Information”.

Axiell’s Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. This Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how we protect your privacy when you visit this Web site and the other Axiell Web sites that display this Privacy Policy (our “Site(s)”). This Privacy Policy describes what types of information we gather and track when you use our Sites, how this information is used and with whom it is shared. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
This site is operated by the Axiell company established in the country to which the content of the site is directed. If the site is not directed to a specific country, the Swedish law and European Privacy Act will be applied. A list of the countries to which the content of the site is directed can be found on the following page: www.axiell.com/contact. (You may also access this page by clicking on the “contact” link at the top of each page). If you are accessing a page of the site directed at a particular EU country, the legal name and contact details of the EU Axiell company operating the site in respect of that EU country can be found on the relevant country page. (For some EU countries, this may be an Axiell company established in a different country). The Axiell company operating the site in respect of a particular EU country is also the data controller in respect of personal data collected through that part of the site. This Axiell company is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Axiell,” “we,” “us,” and “our”.

We also recommend to use the Google Opt-out plugin, found to be downloaded and installed here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
Changes to This Privacy Policy
As we add new features and functionality to our Sites, we may need to update or revise this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on our Sites. These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on our Sites. They will apply only to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised version. Your use of one of our Sites following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. For this reason, it is important to review this Privacy Policy regularly.
If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will provide a notice at the top of this Privacy Policy for at least 30 days after the new effective date, so that you can see at a glance whether our Privacy Policy has changed since your last visit. You may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Axiell Group Online Privacy Policy” at the bottom of each page of our Sites.
Privacy Notices
This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “Privacy Notices” posted on our Sites. Generally, Privacy Notices provide details about the personal information we collect on particular pages or particular areas of a Site, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.
What Personal Information Do We Collect Through Our Sites?
Information You Provide
We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use our Sites. The information we collect depends on how you use our Sites. For example, if you sign up to receive email communications from us, we collect your email address and any related information you provide. If you communicate with us using the “Contact Us” feature, we collect the information you provide when you complete the “Contact Us” form etc.
Generally, our sites distinguish between information we need in order to provide you with a particular product, service or to fulfill your request (“mandatory fields”), and information that although useful is optional with respect to that particular product, service or your request. Please be aware that if you do not provide us with mandatory fields we will not be able to provide you with the product or service or to fulfill your request.
Supplemental Information
From time to time, we may supplement the information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address, information based on your zip code, or information about your business. We may also supplement the information you give us with information we collect from you through other Axiell Web sites and/or other channels. For example, if you are an Axiell customer, we may supplement the information you provide online with information you provide in your other business dealings with Axiell, or your social interactions with our company.
Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser
We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet Service Provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, your approximate location and the pages you visit.
An “IP address” is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. It is used to identify your computer’s “location” in cyberspace and physically, so that the information you request can be delivered to you. If you use a dial-up connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP Address each time you connect to the Internet. If, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer. Although it does not identify you by name, we treat your IP address as your personal information.
You should be aware that when you respond to an electronic communication you receive from us, for example, by opening an email, downloading images or clicking on a link in an electronic newsletter, your browser tells us that you (or someone using your email address) has done so.
We use this information to improve our marketing efforts. In addition, we review our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – for security and fraud prevention purposes. If criminal activity is suspected, we may share our server logs and the personal information we have collected through this Site with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
A cookie is a small file sent by a Website and stored on a user’s computer which enables the Website to remember information about you and your preferences.  We use “cookies” and other Web technologies in a number of ways. For example, we may use these technologies:
to collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;
to support the features and functionality of our Sites – for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to our Sites;
to personalize your experience when you use our Sites;
to measure the success of our web or email advertising.
We use cookies to adapt the content of our site, and advertisement to you of the site, apply functions for social media and analyze our traffic. We collect and send information about your usage of our site to those Social media, advertising and analysis companies we cooperate with, like Google, LeadFeeder, HootSuite, Facebook and Linkedin amongst others.
These companies can in their turn combine this information with other information you have shared, or they have collected, when their services have been in use.
The cookies we use can be classified into two categories:
“Session cookies” which are allocated to your computer for the duration of your visit of our Sites and which will be automatically removed from your computer when you close your browser.
“Persistent cookies” which expire after a reasonable period of time or until the user deletes the cookie.
Some of these uses may involve the use of “third party cookies”; that is, cookies that are set by software used by one of our service providers, such as to carry out statistical analysis of page use, page interactions and paths through the site, or for the purposes of serving internet advertisements using an online advertising supplier.
Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you by name. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, signed up on a newsletter or by signing up to use a password-protected area on one of our Sites, we may link the information we collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave a Site. For more information on how to do so, please refer to your browser ‘help’ section or see https://www.allaboutcookies.org or https://www.aboutcookies.org. You now have the option to accept or reject cookies through the cookie consent form, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Sites.
