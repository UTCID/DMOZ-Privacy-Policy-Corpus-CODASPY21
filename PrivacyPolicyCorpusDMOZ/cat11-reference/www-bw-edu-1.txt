Payment due datesAll university charges and fees are due in full by Friday, August 14, 2020 for fall semester and by Friday, December 4, 2020 for spring semester. It is suggested that all necessary applications for financial aid assistance should be completed prior to the first billing due date.
Finance Charges and Late FeesA finance charge will be added to any account balance remaining after the first week of classes. The finance charge is assessed monthly at a rate of .417% on any unpaid balance until the account is paid in full. If full payment cannot be made by the first due date, the student is advised to consider using one of BW's monthly payment plans. There is a nominal processing fee; however, finance charges are not assessed to payment plan users who remain current with their scheduled payments. View payment plan options, register for a payment plan, and make payments through the BW Payment Portal.Access the BW Payment Portal to Access Payment PlansStudents >Authorized Users > (students can designate parents or guardians as authorized users in the Payment Portal)Delinquent Billing AccountsStudents with delinquent billing accounts will not be allowed to register for the next semester unless full payment of the account has been received prior to the student registration appointment time. Students/families using a BW monthly payment plan must be current with their monthly payments or registration will be delayed until payments are up to date.Students who are delinquent in meeting their financial obligations to the University are subject to additional restrictions. Certificates of credit (transcripts) or letters of honorable dismissal will not be issued. Diplomas will not be awarded. Students should contact the bursar to make arrangements to resolve their delinquent payment status.University tuition and all related charges are adjusted based on the published billing policy. First-time BW students receiving Federal Title IV funds may be subject to a different billing policy schedule as required by federal regulation. For additional information contact the Financial Aid Office.REFUND POLICYComplete the refund application to request a refund from BW. Withdrawals after the ninth week of the semester are permitted only for prolonged illness, change of employment or other circumstances beyond the student's control. All requests for withdrawal before the end of a term must be in writing and should be addressed to the registrar in the Office of Registration & Records (copy to the Bursar's Office). Refunds after the ninth week, when permitted, are made according to the published billing policy assuming that the tuition and fees have been paid in full.For withdrawals before the first scheduled class at the beginning of the semester, 100 percent of the tuition charges are removed. Room charges and Jacket Express account adjustments will be on a prorated basis.Students who do not abide by the regulations of the residence halls or who show an unwillingness to cooperate with those in charge will be instructed to leave the residence hall. Any student leaving the residence hall or the University under disciplinary action is not entitled to any refund regardless of the time remaining in the term.In the unlikely event that Baldwin Wallace University suspends operations, including the cancellation of classes as a result of a pandemic or other similar occurrence, the University will reopen and continue the semester as soon as feasible. Prepaid tuition, fees, room and board will not be refunded under this circumstance. All payments will be held and applied to the continued semester as though there were no interruption of services.BILLING POLICYIf you drop a course or withdraw completely, you must notify the Office of Registration & Records immediately. The Cashier's Office will make the necessary adjustments to your student billing account based on the date furnished by the Office of Registration & Records.
