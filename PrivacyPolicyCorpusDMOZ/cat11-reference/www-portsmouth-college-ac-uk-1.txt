If you use features of our websites to apply to join the College (for example, the online student application form), we will further process your personal information in accordance with our relevant privacy notice.

In all such cases the College either:
has data protection contracts in place with these organisations confirming that processing of personal information will be in accordance with European Data Protection legislation; or
in the case of US based organisations, is satisfied that the organisation processes personal information in accordance with European Data Protection legislation through their membership of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield programme.
