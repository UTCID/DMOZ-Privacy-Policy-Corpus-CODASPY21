Some links, primarily to book industry sites and entities, are provided as a service to our users. Other links to suppliers are available as part of paid advertising packages.
Data Gathering & Usage
Bowker collects the domain names and e-mail addresses (where possible) of visitors and subscribers to our websites and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. We aggregate information on what pages visitors and subscribers access or visit, as well as information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information and/or site registrations).
The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our websites, used to compile internal statistical and usage information, used to notify visitors and subscribers about updates to our websites, used to inform visitors and subscribers of other Bowker products or services they may be interested in, and used to inform visitors and subscribers of helpful products or services offered by others. Visitors and subscribers who provide their mailing address, telephone number, and/or e-mail address may be contacted for these purposes using any of these methods.
Electronic "cookies" are codes placed on your hard drive to enable sites to recognize if you have been there before. Cookies are given to visitors and subscribers of our websites so that Bowker can keep track of the domain from which people visit.
We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies or third party advertising agencies that track certain Internet activity.
From time to time, we may use information collected and supplied by visitors and subscribers for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our websites to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
