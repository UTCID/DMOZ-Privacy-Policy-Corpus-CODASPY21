Personal Care Attendant Policy
1.0 Purpose
Bunker Hill Community College is committed to ensuring that all students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services to ensure equal access to and nondiscrimination in all College programs, services, and activities. Bunker Hill Community College makes every reasonable effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and applicable state law.
Bunker Hill Community College permits students with certain documented disabilities who need  assistance with daily activities  (i.e., dressing, bathing, feeding, transporting, errands, etc.) and/or require nursing care to retain the services of a Personal Care Attendant (PCA).   Bunker Hill Community College does not provide, coordinate, or assume any financial responsibilities for PCA services.  The hiring, training, supervising and paying for PCA services is the sole responsibility of the student.
Students who require PCA services must make arrangements to provide for his/her own PCA and must follow the policies, procedures and guidelines as listed below.
2.0 Revision History
None
3.0 Persons Affected
Students with documented disabilities that require  assistance from a PCA.
4.0 Policy
Bunker Hill Community College strives to reasonably and effectively accommodate qualified students with disabilities in accordance with applicable laws. An accommodation may require the use of a Personal Care Attendant (PCA) to address the personal needs of a qualified student with a disability in order for that student to fully participate in College activities, services, and programs. Students must request all accommodations, including the use of a PCA, through Disability Services (DS). Disability Services will then determine if the student’s documentation is sufficient to support the request for the use of a PCA. It is the responsibility of the qualified student with a disability to make appropriate arrangements to obtain and maintain PCA services. The College does not coordinate, supervise or pay for PCA services and assumes no responsibility over the relationship between a student and his/her PCA.
5.0 Definitions
Student with a Disability: A student with a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment.
Qualified Student with a Disability (QSWD): A student who has a documented disability and can perform the essential functions and/or technical standards of an academic program, with or without reasonable accommodation and has submitted medical documentation to Disability Support Services to support consideration for accommodations under applicable law.
Student: A currently enrolled member of the Bunker Hill Community College student body.
Personal Care: The performance of routine daily tasks of a personal nature that enables an individual to function independently.  These activities may include, but are not limited to:
activities of daily living, such as, walking, bathing, dressing, toileting, grooming;
transporting or escorting;
turning pages, retrieving books; and
alerting of dangerous conditions, environment or situation.
Personal Care Attendant: A PCA is defined as a person who provides personal care/assistance (chronic or temporary) to a student with a disability or other health care needs with activities of daily living including nursing services or assistance with normal life functions.
6.0 Student Responsibilities
It is the student’s sole responsibility to make the appropriate arrangements to contract services with a licensed agency to provide the services of a Personal Care Attendant or a licensed, private PCA to provide these services. Any student who wishes to request these accommodations must:
Provide Disability Services with medical documentation (see Disability Services Documentation Guidelines). Documentation must specify (i) the nature of the disability, (ii) the need for the PCA and, (iii) the services to be provided by the PCA.
Secure a PCA prior to attending any college-related activity, (i.e. orientation, placement testing, registration, programs, events, and class attendance). The college will not be responsible for providing a PCA on an interim basis.
It is highly recommended that the student hire a licensed medical/nursing agency and provide a copy to BHCC Office of Disability Services prior to  Disability services recommends against using a friend or family member as a PCA.
Develop a clear job description/contract and list of responsibilities for assistance with daily living activities. The student will direct the activities of the PCA while at BHCC. BHCC will not assume responsibility for the PCA or his/her/their failure to fulfill the contracted responsibilities.
Ensure that each PCA completes the Personal Care Attendant Agreement each academic year and completes a criminal and sex offender background check and immunization clearances prior to beginning their duties on campus and provide a copy to the BHCC Office of Disability Services.
The student shall notify the BHCC Office of Disability Services if PCA personnel changes occur during the semester and the new PCA and the student shall complete the Personal Care Attendant Agreement through Disability Services prior to beginning their duties on campus.
Ensure that the PCA clearly understands his or her duties and responsibilities.
Establish a contingency plan should the regularly scheduled PCA be unavailable.
Ensure that PCA follows College policies and abides by the Student Handbook.
The student is responsible for all actions of his/her PCA.
Pay for all PCA services.
