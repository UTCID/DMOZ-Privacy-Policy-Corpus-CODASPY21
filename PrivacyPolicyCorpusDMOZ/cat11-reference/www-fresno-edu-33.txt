Tuition refunds for students enrolled in online programs who reside in Maryland or Oregon will be issued in accordance with the policies required by the laws and regulations of those states. However, if FPU’s refund policy is more beneficial to those students, it will follow its refund policy and provide for refunds of tuition as provided in that policy.Maryland Refund PolicyAs required by the Maryland Higher Education Commission, the minimum refund that The Chicago School will pay to a Maryland student who withdraws or is terminated after completing only a portion of a course, program, or term within the applicable billing period is as follows:Proportion of Total Course, Program, or Term Completed as of Date of Withdrawal or TerminationTuition RefundLess than 10%90% refund10% up to but not including 20%80% refund20% up to but not including 30%60% refund30% up to but not including 40%40% refund40% up to but not including 60%20% refundMore than 60%No refundA refund due to a Maryland student will be based on the date of withdrawal or termination and paid within 60 days from the date of withdrawal or termination.This refund policy must be disclosed to students upon enrollment, and documentation verifying student refunds in accordance with this policy must be maintained.Oregon Refund PolicyCourses dropped during the Add/Drop period will be refunded 100% of tuition and course fees. Oregon students who withdraw from a course after the Add/Drop period are eligible for a partial refund through the middle week of the applicable term/semester.Refunds are based on unused instructional time and are prorated on a weekly basis as detailed below.16 WeeksDrop/Withdrawal Refund ScheduleDrop/WithdrawalRefundWeek 1100%Week 288%Week 382%Week 475%Week 569%Week 663%Week 756%Week 850%Week 9-160%15 WeeksDrop/Withdrawal Refund ScheduleDrop/WithdrawalRefundWeek 1100%Week 287%Week 380%Week 473%Week 567%Week 660%Week 753%Week 847%Week 9-150%12 WeeksDrop/Withdrawal Refund ScheduleDrop/WithdrawalRefundWeek 1100%Week 283%Week 375%Week 467%Week 558%Week 650%Week 7-120%8 WeeksDrop/Withdrawal Refund ScheduleDrop/WithdrawalRefundWeek 1100%Week 275%Week 363%Week 450%Week 5-80%6 WeeksDrop/Withdrawal Refund ScheduleDrop/WithdrawalRefundWeek 1100%Week 275%Week 350%Week 4-60%Student Financial ServicesPhone: 559-453-2041 Toll free: 866-321-7502 Cashier: 559-453-5586 Fax: 559-453-5595 sfs@fresno.eduFAFSA code: 001253 Scholarships made attending seminary possible for me.Dustin MaddoxMaster of DivinityStudentsAcademic Success CenterResourcesALASALAS RegistrationCulturally Embedded CurriculumIntercultural Learning CenterMeet the TeamMeet the Peer MentorsBookstoreCareer DevelopmentFrequently Asked QuestionsCareer Resources LibraryCareer AssessmentsCareer Exploration & PlanningAre You Career Ready?Resumes and Cover LettersLinkedIn ProfileInternshipsInterview PreparationVolunteer ResourcesJob ListingsFeatured Employer PartnersJob Search StrategiesLinkedIn: Social Media NetworkingNetworkingGraduate SchoolConsidering AttendingTypes of ProgramsPrepare for Graduate SchoolTimelineResearch Graduate ProgramsApplication ProcessEntrance ExamsStatement of Purpose / Personal StatementsLetters of RecommendationFinancing Graduate SchoolPreparing a Curriculum Vitae (CV)Graduate School InterviewsInternational StudentsWork in the USA / Visa ResourcesThe US Application ProcessJob & Internship ListingsResume & Application LettersWork Study USAInterview PreparationResourcesStudent VeteransTransferable Skills & CrosswalksCareer Assessment, Selection & ProgramsChoosing the Right School for YouEmploymentResume WritingInterviewingHelpful ResourcesStudents with DisabilitiesCareer Assessment and ExplorationResume WritingInterviewingInternshipsEmploymentDisclosure & Other Helpful ResourcesDisability ServicesDisability FormsPolicyInformation for FacultyProceduresRights and ResponsibilitiesHiebert LibraryLibrary Services During the COVID-19 PandemicLibrary Staff ListingIT ServicesNetwork StatusHardware / SoftwareMy FPURegistrar's OfficeHow to RegisterAcademic CatalogsCourse Schedules and Academic CalendarsDC Cohort SchedulesDC Gen Ed & Elective SchedulesUndergraduate Final ExamsRegistration and Academic PoliciesConfidentiality (FERPA)DefinitionsAnnual Notification of Students' Rights Under FERPAStudents' Rights to Privacy Under FERPAProcedure To Inspect Education RecordsRight of University to Refuse AccessRefusal to Provide CopiesFees for Copies of RecordsDisclosure of Education RecordsDe-Identified Student DataDirectory InformationStudents' Right on Non-Disclosure of Directory InformationRecords of Requests and DisclosuresChallenge of the Contents of Education RecordsObtaining Education Records of Deceased StudentsAcademic StatusGrade Reporting and AppealsPetitionsRegistration DeadlinesDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—GradDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—DCDrop/Withdraw Deadlines—TUGSyllabiTypes of CoursesWait ListsGraduation GuaranteesTransferring Courses and Course CreditTraditional Daytime (Undergraduate)TUG Transfer FAQsEvening Accelerated (Degree Completion)DC Transfer FAQsADT PathwaysRequest TranscriptsCE & CPD TranscriptsGraduationCommencementVeterans ServicesAttendance & LoadVeterans Information LinksVeterans FAQFormsFaculty ResourcesSeminary StudentsMFT Approved OrganizationsStudent Financial ServicesCost of AttendanceTypes of AidInstitutional AidFederal AidFederal Work StudyLoansPrivate LoansState AidScholarshipsThe Samaritan ScholarshipMLK Jr. & Hamer ScholarshipReceiving AidApplying for Financial AidContinued EligibilitySatisfactory Academic ProgressSAP PolicyVerificationWithdrawalFormsOnline Payment CenterResourcesStaff DirectoryGlossary of TermsTerms and ConditionsState-Specific Refund Policiese-Refunds/Payment InstructionsSunbirdCentralUpcoming Events for StudentsLiberal Arts Information MeetingDec 10, 2020 6:00pm to 7:00pmSample a Course: MA Leadership & Graduate ProgramDec 17, 2020 6:00pm to 7:00pmEdmund Janzen Lectureship in Biblical Studies 2021Mar 18, 2021 7:00pm to 8:30pmMar 19, 2021 10:00amUpcoming Admission EventsLiberal Arts Information MeetingDec 10, 2020 6:00pm to 7:00pmSample a Course: MA Leadership & Graduate ProgramDec 17, 2020 6:00pm to 7:00pmB.S.
