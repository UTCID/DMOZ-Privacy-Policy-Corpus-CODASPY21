White House: Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights

News Reports
Background
Building on the recommendations of a Green Paper on Privacy and Innovation released by the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force in December 2010, the Administration released Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Economy. The report contains a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights with the following principles:
Individual Control: Consumers have a right to exercise control over what personal data
companies collect from them and how they use it.
Transparency: Consumers have a right to easily understandable and accessible information
about privacy and security practices.
Respect for Context: Consumers have a right to expect that companies will collect, use, and
disclose personal data in ways that are consistent with the context in which consumers
provide the data.
Security: Consumers have a right to secure and responsible handling of personal data.
Access and Accuracy: Consumers have a right to access and correct personal data in usable
formats, in a manner that is appropriate to the sensitivity of the data and the risk of adverse
consequences to consumers if the data is inaccurate.
Focused Collection: Consumers have a right to reasonable limits on the personal data that
companies collect and retain.
Accountability: Consumers have a right to have personal data handled by companies with
appropriate measures in place to assure they adhere to the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
In introducing the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, President Obama stated that "even though we live in a world in which we share personal information more freely than in the past, we must reject the conclusion that privacy is an outmoded value. It has been at the heart of our democracy from its inception, and we need it now more than ever.”

EPIC Tells FCC to Reject "Notice and Choice" Approach to Privacy: EPIC has filed reply comments with the Federal Communications Commission on the proposed broadband privacy rules. EPIC said that the proposed rules are a modest first step and that the FCC has legal authority to do more to safeguard American consumers. EPIC also responded to erroneous statements from industry groups that the FTC's "notice and choice" framework safeguards consumer privacy. EPIC described numerous shortcomings, including lack of enforcement, frequent changes in privacy policies, and data breaches. "Notice and choice" is “directly at odds with baseline privacy standards,” EPIC said. EPIC previously urged the Commission to "address the full range of communications privacy issues facing US consumers" and to apply the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to communications data. (Jul.

Lack of Privacy Impacts Internet Use, Economy, Says NTIA Survey: A recent study by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration found that nearly half of Internet users in the US refrained from online activities due to privacy and security concerns. Identity theft was the top concern, cited by 63 percent of respondents, followed by financial fraud, noted by 45 percent. Nearly a quarter of Americans cited concerns about online tracking. “In addition to being a problem of great concern to many Americans, privacy and security issues may reduce economic activity and hamper the free exchange of ideas online,” NTIA concluded. EPIC has supported enactment of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and recently launched “Data Protection 2016,” a non-partisan campaign to make data protection an issue in the 2016 election. (May. 16, 2016)

FCC Moves Forward With Narrow Privacy Rules (Mar. 31, 2016) +
The Federal Communications Commission has voted to adopt a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on consumer privacy regulations. The proposal follows Chairman Wheeler's earlier draft proposal, which EPIC explained was too limited to safeguard online privacy. During the vote, Commissioner Ajit Pai echoed EPIC's view that the rulemaking should not focus solely on ISPs. EPIC has argued that the FCC proposal ignores invasive practices by Internet firms, including search companies and social media firms that track and profile Internet users. EPIC previously urged the Commission to "address the full range of communications privacy issues facing US consumers" and to apply the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to communications data.
EPIC Urges FCC to Establish Communications Privacy Protections for Consumers (Jan. 20, 2016) +
EPIC has submitted a letter to the Federal Communications Commission urging the agency to undertake a rulemaking to protect the communications privacy of consumers. EPIC asked the FCC to explore "the full range of communications privacy issues facing US consumers." EPIC proposed that the FCC implement Fair Information Practices and the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights; adopt data minimization requirements; promote Privacy-Enhancing Technologies; and require opt-in consent for the use or disclosure of consumer data. EPIC suggested that the FCC model its communications privacy rules on the Code of Fair Information Practices for the National Information Infrastructure. EPIC has worked with the FCC to promote consumer privacy in the communications field for more than 20 years.
White House Announces Federal Privacy Council (Dec.
4, 2015) +
White House OMB Director Shaun Donovan announced plans to establish a new Federal Privacy Council. The Privacy Council will develop and coordinate privacy strategies and best practices across the federal government. Director Donovan remarked, " Government has a critical role in enforcing and ensuring protections for the privacy of its citizens." Donovan also announced plans to update privacy guidance for federal agencies. Donovan highlighted the White House's efforts to protect privacy and civil liberties, including the White House Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and Big Data Review. EPIC recently urged Congress to enact the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and establish an independent privacy agency.
EPIC to Call For Comprehensive Overhaul of U.S. Privacy Law (Nov.
2, 2015) +
In testimony before the US Congress, EPIC's Marc Rotenberg is expected to say that the recent decision of the European Court confirmed what everyone already knows, US privacy law is not adequate. "Our country suffers from an epidemic of data breaches and identity theft. And all the data indicates these problems are getting worse." EPIC, consumer allies, and privacy experts are urging the Congress to enact the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, modernize the Privacy Act, create an independent privacy agency, and ratify the International Privacy Convention. "These changes will benefit consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic."
New Report Highlights Consumer Goals for EU Privacy Law (Sep. 17, 2015) +
BEUC, The European Consumer Organization, has published "My Personal Data", outlining key requirements for negotiations in Europe on the General Data Protection Regulations. BEUC underscored "the urgent need to put consumers back in control over the way their personal data is processed online." The BEUC report emphasized strong data protection principles, enhanced rights for individuals, and a comprehensive enforcement scheme. EU negotiations involve a "trilogue" of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission, with the EU Data Supervisor also playing an active role. In the U.S., EPIC supports the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and organized a coalition of consumer privacy groups to urge President Obama to enact the privacy framework into law.
EPIC Launches State Policy Project (May.
5, 2015) +
EPIC has launched the EPIC State Policy Project to track legislation across the county concerning
privacy and civil liberties. The EPIC State Project will identify new developments and model legislation. The Project builds on EPIC's extensive work on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues in the states.

White House (Commerce Dept.) Privacy Bill Not Helpful, Unworkable (Mar.
2, 2015) +
The White House has released a consumer privacy proposal, prepared by the Commerce Department.
The bill falls far short of the recommendations for a “Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights”
set out by President Obama in 2012 and broadly supported by consumer organizations. The draft proposal lacks meaningful protections for consumers, would preempt stronger state laws, and create unnecessary regulatory burdens for businesses. EPIC has long recommended enactment of consumer privacy legislation based on “Fair Information Practices,” the basic framework for modern privacy law.
EPIC Urges House to Safeguard Consumer Privacy
(Jan. 26, 2015) +
EPIC has sent a statement to the House Commerce Committee for the hearing, "What are the Elements of Sound Data Breach Legislation?". EPIC had testified before the House Committee in 2011 on data breach notification, urging Congress to set a national baseline standard. EPIC also supports enactment of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. EPIC also urged the House Committee to promote "algorithmic transparency."
EPIC has warned that “[t]he ongoing collection of personal information in the United States without sufficient privacy safeguards has led to staggering increases in identity theft,security breaches, and financial fraud.”
Obama Announces New Consumer Privacy Initiatives (Jan. 12, 2015) +
Today the President announced several initiatives to help protect consumer privacy following many, many data breaches. The President will move forward the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, a model framework for federal consumer privacy legislation, that EPIC supported in comments to executive agencies, legislators, and the White House. The President also proposed that financial firms disclose credit scores and that Congress enact the Student Digital Privacy Act based on "Fair Information Practices."
FTC Finalizes Snapchat Settlement (Jan.
2, 2015) +
The Federal Trade Commission has approved a final order with Snapchat, the messaging service that falsely promised that messages sent and received through the service would "disappear forever.” The Commission’s investigation and initial proposed consent order followed a complaint filed by EPIC in 2013. EPIC brought the complaint against Snapchat after a researcher discovered that Snapchat photos could be retrieved by others after they should have vanished. EPIC also filed comments regarding the Commission's proposed consent order, expressing support for the Commission’s findings but recommending that Snapchat should be required to implement the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and make Snapchat's privacy assessments publicly available. Under the settlement, Snapchat will be subject to 20 years of privacy audits, and will be prohibited from making false claims about its privacy policies. For more information, see EPIC: In re Google, EPIC: In re Facebook and EPIC: FTC.
After Public Outcry, Microsoft Reverses Course on Email Search (Apr.
5, 2014) +
After criticism by bloggers, consumers, and privacy advocates - including EPIC - Microsoft will change a troubling provision in its privacy policy. In March, Microsoft searched a blogger's private Hotmaill account to determine whether the subscriber to the Microsoft service received leaked versions of Windows 8. At the time, Microsoft claimed that the search was permissible under the Microsoft Online terms of service. This week Microsoft, announced it would no longer search customers' accounts itself if it suspected wrongdoing and would instead refer such matters over to law enforcement. According to Microsoft, Hotmail has 170 million active users. For more information see: EPIC: Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
EPIC, Coalition Urge President Obama to Advance Privacy Bill of Rights (Feb. 24, 2014) +
EPIC along with a coalition of over 40 public interest organizations has urged the President to implement the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, a comprehensive framework for privacy protection. The letter comes on the two-year anniversary of the Administration's introduction of the Privacy Bill of Rights, which includes baseline privacy principles, such as individual control and transparency, respect for context and focused collectionm and better access, accuracy, and accountability. The President called the Privacy Bill of Rights a "blueprint for privacy in the information age" and said his Administration "will work to advance these principles and work with Congress to put them into the law." The letter from the organizations states, "We urge you to work with those in Congress who favor the privacy rights of Americans, who support updates to privacy law, and who understand why this issue is so critical to so many Americans. And let those who stand in the way explain to their constituents why they believe that it is not necessary for Congress to do anything further to protect the fundamental rights of Americans." For more information, See EPIC: White House: Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
"I will reform our surveillance programs," President Obama Tells Nation (Jan. 29, 2014) +
Stating that "America must move off a permanent war footing," President Obama announced (video) at the State of the Union that "working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs." (50:30) The President continued, (text) "because the vital work of intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated." Citing the need to close the prison in Guantanamo, the President also said "we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world." EPIC and other consumer privacy organizations have urged the President to move forward the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and to support the International Privacy Convention.
EPIC's Rotenberg Urges State Attorneys General to Safeguard Consumer Privacy (Apr. 16, 2013) +
Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Attorneys General, EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said that the state AG's cannot sit on the sidelines as consumers face increasing risks of identity theft, security breaches, and secretive profiling. Rotenberg said the onus shouldn’t be on consumers to keep up with every-changing policy practices. “There is no reason that a customer should have to go back and check their privacy settings when a company changes its business practice." The Attorneys General recently fined Google $7 m for violating state consumer protection laws when the companies vehicles, loaded with Internet packet sniffers, intercepted private residential communications. EPIC has also launched a promotional video "Good to Really Know" with information for consumers about online privacy. For more information, see EPIC: Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights and EPIC: Consumer Privacy.
EPIC Urges FTC to Develop Meaningful Privacy Protections for Mobile Services (Jul. 11, 2012) +
EPIC has submitted comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning "Advertising and Privacy Disclosures in a Digital World". The FTC is currently exploring ways businesses could improve privacy notices for mobile devices. EPIC pointed out that many of the techniques, such as privacy icons, suffer from the same problems as traditional privacy notices. EPIC recommended that the FTC focus instead on substantive privacy protections, such as those found in the federal Privacy Act, sectoral privacy laws, and the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, proposed by the White House. An earlier FTC report called for new privacy legislation and an FTC investigation documented privacy problems with mobile applications for children. For more information, see EPIC: Federal Trade Commission.
EPIC Calls on FTC to Develop Substantive Privacy Protections at Workshop on Mobile Advertising (May. 11, 2012) +
EPIC submitted comments to the Federal Trade Commission for the May 30 workshop on mobile advertising disclosures. EPIC recommended that the agency focus on the development of substantive privacy protections, such as the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights announced by the President earlier this year, for mobile services. EPIC also recommended that the workshop address a series of problems with the "notice and consent" approach, as well as the merits of innovative, nonverbal approaches proposed by privacy scholars. The workshop follows an FTC report calling for privacy legislation and an investigation that documented privacy problems with mobile applications for children. For more information, see EPIC: Federal Trade Commission.
EPIC to Commerce Department: Establish Privacy Rights (Apr.
4, 2012) +
EPIC submitted comments to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the Department of Commerce, urging the agency to implement the principles set out in the White House Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
