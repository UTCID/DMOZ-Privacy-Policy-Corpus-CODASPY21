Why study Paralegal Studies?
This certificate in paralegal studies is for people who have already earned an associate degree but may wish to change careers or continue in their studies.
The effective practice of law requires a team of conscientous, competent professionals. A critical member of that team is the paralegal, who plays a vital role in the legal system by completing essential legal tasks that ensure the delivery of quality legal services to the client. A paralegal’s primary role is to provide support to attorneys. Paralegals may work specifically with one lawyer or a group of attorneys. The work that paralegals do varies based on the size and practice area of the firm at which they are employed, but commonly includes meeting with clients, interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, researching case law and legal precedents, drafting documents, pleadings, and correspondence with clients and the court.
The paralegal field is growing and offers opportunities in many different areas of concentration. A paralegal can work in a variety of legal fields, finding success with corporate firms, private firms or in the public arena. Much like attorneys, paralegals can choose a certain type of law, which can determine the type of work they will do on a regular basis. A litigation paralegal, for example, may prepare clients for trial, interview witnesses, research legal precedents pertinent to a case, and must have a wide knowledge of the court rules and evidentiary issues. A paralegal degree does offers opportunities outside the legal field, including in real estate, hospitals, nonprofits and health care systems.

You must have an associate degree for acceptance into this certificate.
