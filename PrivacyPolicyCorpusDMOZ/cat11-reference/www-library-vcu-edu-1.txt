Personal information collected
Data collected from forms
When you choose to provide personal information to us to conduct an online transaction, we use it only for the purpose of conducting the specific online transaction that you requested. For each online transaction, we require only the minimum amount of personal information required to process your request. Examples of personal information that may be required to process an online transaction include:

We do not give, share, sell or transfer any personal information you enter in a form to a third party unless required to do so by law.

You can opt out of our use of your information by sending an email to VCU Development and Alumni Relations.
Non-Personal information collected
We collect non-personal information from every visitor to the VCU Libraries Website. For example, to track the number of computers used to visit our site and to identify our most popular pages we collect the Internet Protocol address - a series of distinct numbers that identify your computer. Other examples of this type of information include the:
browser type and version and the operating system you are using,
domain name of the Website or internet service provider and referral site from which you linked to our site
geographical location of the network used for accessing the VCU Libraries Website, and
time and date of access.
We use this non-personal information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site content and server performance.

These third-party services use a persistent cookie to gather non-personally identifiable information such as network location; hostname; web pages requested; referring web page; browser used; screen resolution; and date and time.
You may opt out of Google Analytics by turning off cookies in your browser preferences or installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
