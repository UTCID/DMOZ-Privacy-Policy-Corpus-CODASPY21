Take the FERPA Training!
Non-Employee Students and Affiliates needing to complete the FERPA training need to submit a UC Learning Center account request by clicking on the "request form" link on the UC Learning Center website. Additional help filling out that form can be found on the UC Learning Center Affiliate Instructions website.
Many university employees with a "legitimate interest" have access to students’ academic records. We are obligated to protect the privacy of the student records to which we have access. The disclosure of information from student records is governed by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, which is intended to protect the student’s right to privacy.
What are student records and what can be disclosed to parties other than the student? Student records maintained by UC or another group acting for UC include, but are not limited to, transcripts (grades), exam papers, test scores, evaluations, and financial aid records.
The following are NOT considered student records:
Applicant records
Campus police records created and maintained solely for law enforcement purposes
Health records which are created, maintained, or used only in connection with treatment
Employment records when employment does not result from, and does not depend upon, the fact that an individual is a student
Alumni records generated or received by the university after an individual is no longer a student, and that are not directly related to the individual's attendance as a student
Personal records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel which are kept in the sole possession of the maker of the record, and are not accessible or revealed to any other individual
Student records information falls into two general categories:
Public information, to which third parties* have access, and
Confidential information, to which third parties may have access ONLY if the student provides explicit written authorization.
* anyone other than the record custodian and the student about whom the information pertains
Public Information for Students Without NRI
UCSC has defined the following items as public information which may be released from student records to any person UNLESS the student has requested Non-Release of Public Information, indicated in Academic Information Systems (AIS) by this windowshade
symbol. No other information may be released without the written consent of the student.
If the student is new, beginning with the first day of the quarter, university officials may release name and college affiliation. Beginning on the first day of instruction, all items of public information may be released unless an NRI has been filed. Prior to the first day of the quarter no information will be released.
If the student is currently enrolled or if the university is between quarters, and the student is activated to the upcoming quarter, you may release items defined as public information with the exception of credits currently enrolled if it is between quarters.
If the student is no longer enrolled ( i.e., the last quarter enrolled is prior to the current quarter), you may release the items indicated below.

The first column lists the type of information; the second concerns New students before the quarter begins; the third new students between the first day of the quarter and first day of instruction; the fourth column concerns continuing students; and the fifth is for students no longer enrolled.

Student names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses are published in the UCSC Campus Directory. Students without an NRI may choose to not release this information to the Campus Directory. All other information contained in a student record is considered confidential.
Some Common Examples of Information Not Defined as Public Information
student schedule, grades, or GPA
student number or student photo
total number of credits completed or anticipated graduation date
social security number or date of birth
financial aid or billing information
If you are unsure, or where the law is silent, the campus is guided by the following principles:
1.      The privacy of an individual is of great weight—in other words: "When in doubt, maintain confidentiality."
2.      The information in a student’s record should be disclosed to the student on request.
3.      If non-directory information is needed to resolve a crisis or emergency situation, an education institution may release that information if the institution determines that the information is "necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals." This includes releasing information to school officials at another institution. In such a situation, consultation with the Office of the Registrar is recommended. In addition, an education institution may be required to report certain types of information to need-to-know offices on campus such as the Title IX Office and/or University of California Police Department.
Each department that maintains student records and each individual who has access to that information is responsible for the confidentiality of the information.
Requesting Non-Release of Public Information (NRI)
Students may request non-release through MyUCSC. The NRI remains in effect until the student requests via MyUCSC that it be rescinded. For students with an NRI, no information may be released. The appropriate response to a request for information about a student with an NRI is "We have no information regarding a person by that name." Students with an NRI can elect to release information to Dean's/Honors Lists and Commencement Programs through MyUCSC.
A school official may assist a student with an NRI as long as the identity of the student can be verified. FERPA states that social security number and date of birth are “not considered reasonable” methods to authenticate the individual’s identity. Instead, you may check the student's state or university-issued photo ID, or ask a combination of identifying questions that are very specific to the student, such as student ID number in combination with classes completed and grades; current class schedule including day, time, building, and instructor; or permanent address information.
Call or e-mail the University Registrar, Tchad Sanger, at 831-459-5604 or cpsanger@ucsc.edu if you have any questions regarding the privacy of student records.
