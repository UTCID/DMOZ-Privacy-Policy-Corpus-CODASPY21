Do Not Track Notice
WSOC does not track its visitors over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, Safari allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. If you would like to learn how to set Safari so that websites do not track you, go here: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11952.

A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID to track the pages visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. These files are used for site registration and to customize your visit to the site.

Your Web browser may notify you when you are receiving a cookie and it may give you the choice to accept or reject it.
