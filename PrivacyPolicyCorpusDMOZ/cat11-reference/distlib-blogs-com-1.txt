Continuing Algorithms of Oppression
For a meeting last week at MPOW we were asked to read Algorithms of Oppression, by Safiya Umoja Noble. As a cis, white male, I found it a good reminder of a lot of stuff I am vaguely aware of, but don't have to "deal with" in the same way as the majority of the world. She makes quite a few references to the library world, in addition to her main focus, which is Google.
Turns out it was an incredibly well-timed read, as that same week, on Dec. 2, Dr. Timnit Gebru was fired from Google for raising pretty much the same points. Well, it's more complicated than that, but that's what it boils down to.
If you're unfamiliar with the story, here are some links:

Report: Academic Freedom Breached at Thompson Rivers University
I first posted about this issue just over a year ago, A disturbing story on academic freedom and predatory publishing, and now it appears to have reached a conclusion, with the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) releasing a 30-page report on their findings. Report: Academic Freedom Breached at Thompson Rivers University
TL;DR:
(Ottawa – November 19, 2019) An investigation into the suspension of Dr. Derek Pyne by Thompson Rivers University (TRU) has concluded that the administration’s actions breached academic freedom.
But you really should read the whole thing. It's mostly about issues of academic freedom, but, because the catalyst appears to have been research about predatory publishing, there's a little bit of that in there too, including this quote from page 27 of the report:
"In an increasingly complex arena for publishing research, universities and academics grapple with assessing faculty members’ published research for tenure and promotion, and for various institutional benefits, including salary increases and research awards. Academic librarians have long provided their expertise in identifying scholarly resources and are now assisting researchers in identifying which constitute legitimate open access publishing and which do not. There is a clear need for universities to ensure the integrity of their academic decisions for tenure and promotion, in particular, by having policies that differentiate between legitimate and predatory publishing."
For anyone from the UofC reading this, please see this section on predatory journals and conferences in our libguide on Scholarly Communication.
At the time of this posting I couldn't find a response on the TRU website.

Some Sci-Hub stuff
Sci-Hub popped up a couple of times today, along with a link to a tool I hadn't seen before.
Tools to liberate scholarly articles, help sources understand journalism and publish printable online zines. Mentioning the existence to journalists
They Know We Know They Know: Does Sci-Hub Affect Library Subscriptions? which in turn led to the
Sci-Hub Stats Browser, which is a dated snapshot of just how comprehensive the Sci-Hub database is. This is data supporting the article, Sci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature.
Wow.

A disturbing story on academic freedom and predatory publishing
While I had actually read the article in question shortly after it first came out, I was unaware of the fallout until earlier this morning. This is a story you should be aware of.
How I learned of it: Investigation launched into alleged academic freedom violations at Thompson Rivers University
What I had missed: B.C. economist in grim battle against deceptive scholarship and Suspended B.C. prof who exposed fake journals welcomes investigation.
In a nutshell, Dr. Derek Pyne wrote a paper in early 2017 titled, The Rewards of Predatory Publications at a Small Business School, in which he looked at how many of his colleagues in the business school at Thompson Rivers University had published articles in predatory journals. Quite a few, as it turned out. From his conclusion (emphasis mine):
Predatory journals have become an increasing problem when it comes to assessing and rewarding researchers for the merit of their publishing records. In addition, the presence of predatory journals makes it difficult for non-experts to judge the quality and validity of published research. This paper finds that, at least at one university, there are few incentives not to publish in predatory journals. In addition, when the opportunity cost of forgone income from extra teaching is significant, publishing in ranked journals is costly.
Of course it's understandable that his colleagues and administrators would be embarrassed by this paper, but apparently he has been suspended from his position, and the university as a whole, for bringing this information to light. I say apparently, because so far Thompson Rivers University hasn't provided any actual reason. Well, they do say all this.... Despite what you'll find in the preceding link, this appears to be completely against the concepts of academic freedom and tenure, like seriously TRU?
So this post is just to make sure y'all are aware of this sorry situation, and I now have an alert on his name so will let you know when it's been resolved. Of course these are my opinions and not those of my employer, yadda yadda yadda.
November 7 Updates:
Here's a good 15-minute audio summary of the whole situation: 10/3 podcast: A B.C. economist is in hot water for exposing fake journals
And here's an article from The Economist I missed from this past summer which mentions Dr. Pyne's paper, but appears to have come out just before his suspension: Some science journals that claim to peer review papers do not do so

New Zealand comes to its senses
Last month I posted about how Into The River had been banned in New Zealand; it was "illegal to supply the book to anyone or to display the book in or within view of a public place."
As of October 14, this ban has been lifted, and the book is once again classified as "unrestricted". You can read the 21-page decision (pdf) if you like; I only skimmed it.  It seems that the President of the Film and Literature Review Board dissented, but majority ruled and the book can once again be read by humans of all ages. Take a look at this excellent site for a complete case study.
I received my copy just yesterday, and do still plan to read it :-)

Are you in NZ? Want a free book? NZ bans award-winning YA novel after complaints from conservative Christian group
I first heard about this on BoingBoing, and followed up with several other articles:
Book case study - Into the River
New Zealand bans award-winning teenage novel after outcry from Christian group
Censorship is alive in New Zealand. I should know: my book was banned
We read the novel New Zealand just banned for sex and drugs. Here’s what the fuss is about
As BoingBoing summarizes:
Ted Dawe's Into the River won the 2013 New Zealand Post Children's Book prize; businesses that sell, lend or gift it face fines of up to NZD10,000.
The book is aimed at teen boys -- a relative rarity in YA literature -- and features sex scenes, a slang term for genitals, and drug use. The group Family First got the NZ Film and Literature Board of Review to ban the book. It is being pulled from stores, libraries, and schools across the country.
Sounds like a pretty good read to me, so I ordered a copy from Amazon. I'll read it, then see if my 13-year-old son is interested, after which I'd be pleased to donate it to a reader from New Zealand. If you want it, please let me know!

Identifying and avoiding predatory publishers: a primer for researchers
My colleague Rob sent a link out about this new 2-page brief from the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL): Identifying and avoiding predatory publishers: a primer for researchers (pdf).
So-called predatory publishers are those that lack discernible scholarship, academic rigour or credibility. They use aggressive practices to recruit authors and editors. Predatory publishers’ opaque operations and editorial processes are suggestive of an intention to deceive both authors and readers (Butler, 2013).
One of the links in the document points out that Jeffrey Beall maintains a list of Potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers. I was surprised at how long it was! :-(

ERIC Webinar: Restoring Access to ERIC's PDFs
In August 2012, ERIC temporarily disabled access to its collection of full text documents due to personally identifiable information found in some of its older documents. Over the past two years, the ERIC team has worked to clear and re-release many of the documents.
ERIC will be hosting a webinar on September 16, 2014 from 1:00–2:30 p.m. EDT to answer many of the questions that have been asked about this process, such as:
Why did ERIC remove access to full text documents?
What process did the ERIC team use to restore the PDFs?
Why did it take almost two years for ERIC to restore the documents?
What are the next steps?
Please email [email protected] to register. Additionally, if you have specific questions, please email them in advance to ensure that it will be answered in the webinar.

What the Heck is Happening up North?
Amanda Wakaruk, Government Information Librarian at the University of Alberta, has written a comprehensive article outlining the BS (my words, not hers), libraries in Canada have been dealing with over the past several years when it comes to accessing Federal information. Her entire paper is available on the UofA Institutional Repository: What the Heck is Happening up North? Canadian Federal Government Information, Circa 2014.
Here's a paragraph to whet your appetite:
Parks Canada removed hundreds of lesson plans from its website, the Aboriginal Portal of Canada was closed with two weeks’ notice, access to tables of 1665-1871 Census statistics disappeared with the decommissioning of E-Stat, and we started to notice serious lapses in content on once trusted websites (e.g., ministerial speeches were no longer being added to departmental websites). To make matters worse, we were learning about restricted access to publications which used to be freely available online. For example, in order to access dozens of reports on the Health Canada website you now have to fill in and submit a form before the pdf document will be sent via email. Because this requires the use of an identifying email address, some suggested that it was in violation of Section 4 of the Privacy Act[24]. Furthermore, when a library staff member attempted to order multiple titles using these forms, she was informed that they would not be provided until she explained how she intended to use them.
Maybe BS isn't strong enough?
Here's a jab from Rick Mercer on the subject:
Hat tip to Dani for the info about this paper!

An experiment in privacy and disclosure
"On April 29, 2014 the Interim Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Chantal Bernier, revealed that Canadian telecommunications companies have disclosed enormous volumes of information to state agencies."
This lead sentence comes from Citizen Lab's recent post, Responding to the Crisis in Canadian Telecommunications. I heard about that post after listening to the most recent episode (#31) of Jesse Brown's Canadaland podcast, Your Telecom Provider is Selling your Information to the Government. Well worth the 32 minutes!
Using the template in the blog post above I have sent requests to Telus (mobile), Fido (mobile) and Shaw (Cable, Internet, VOIP) asking them to disclose the personal information it collects, retains, manages, and discloses about me, and I plan to post the information I receive here because CitizenLab makes such a compelling case and I want this information generally to be public:
Why Your Requests Matter
Beyond simply exercising your legal rights, these requests matter on both the personal and the national level. Personally, by filing these requests you will be empowered to think about whether you’re OK with the amount(s) of information that your telecommunications companies collect or record about you, the duration of time they record that information, and their willingness to explain who they share information with. In effect, you won’t be at the mercy of pundits and talking heads to explain whether the collection of data matters to your life, in the abstract, because you’ll have the data in hand to make your own decisions and reach your own conclusions.
Beyond self-empowerment, it’s important for Canadians generally to file these requests to telecommunications companies because the companies have so steadfastly refused to communicate with the experts, with government bodies, and with interested members of the press. Almost all of the ‘polite’ ways of figuring out what these companies are up to have been exhausted: it’s time, unfortunately, to compel these companies to explain why they collect data, how much of it they collect, and explain why they disclose the information. To be clear, telecommunications companies in the United States and Europe have already begun releasing ‘transparency reports’, or documents explaining how and why the companies share information with state agencies. Those reports are the result of American and European publics supporting their civil advocates and privacy officers, lending their incredibly powerful voices to the policy and legal efforts that had been ongoing for years. Canadians are amongst the most digitally connected populations on earth: now it’s time for us all to figure out who’s been monitoring, and disclosing, who we’ve been connecting to and whether existing practices need to be reined in.
Requests were sent via email to Shaw and Telus on May 7, 2014, and via snail mail to Fido on May 8, 2014. I received an automated email response from Telus in 24 minutes, and nothing of the sort from Shaw.
I'll be back in early June or sooner with an update.

Dale Askey Recipient of the 2014 CLA Award for the Advancement of Intellectual Freedom in Canada
You may remember Dale Askey from such posts as Edwin Mellen Press files lawsuit against academic librarian, Minor updates on the Edwin Mellen lawsuit, and ONE lawsuit dropped by Edwin Mellen Press, but Askey is still being sued personally #FreeDaleAskey. All's been quiet in public on that whole fiasco as far as I can tell, but this just in:
The Canadian Library Association is pleased to announce that Dale Askey, of McMaster University, has been chosen as winner of the 2014 Award for the Advancement of Intellectual Freedom in Canada for his commitment to intellectual freedom in the face of an unprecedented defamation suit brought against him by the academic publisher Edwin Mellen Press.
Congratulations and stand strong, Dale!

Adobe backs down: We Didn’t Mean to Use DRM to Break Your eBook Readers
A quick follow up from yesterday's post, again from The Digital Reader, in which Adobe smartly reverses course and will not cause many loser devices to stop working with their DRM after all. Of course, DRM still sucks. Posted with Blogsy

A short roundup of thoughts around Harvard Business School Press
A couple of weeks ago I was contacted by a writer for The Chronicle of Higher Education for a brief comment on this excellent post by Joshua Gans, Harvard Business School Publishing crosses the ‘evil’ academic line. It seems Prof. Gans had found, among others, my post from 2009 raising an eyebrow over the practice of HBSP only allowing persistent links to certain articles if an additional fee was paid.
Here are some additional articles and posts you should read, in addition the the piece that came out in the Chronicle, Librarians Accuse Harvard Business Publishing of Unfair Prices.
As in 2009, Meredith is all over the issue in a very articulate way: I hate to say “I told you so.” Drawing the line with HBR.
Prof. Gans has a followup post on the Digitopoly site: Clarifying the issues with Harvard Business Review.
The Financial Times piece referenced by Meredith and written by Dr. Gans: Harvard Business Review should pay a price for its fees.
I love the idea that HBSP might be overstepping its bounds legally, at least here in Canada, with respect to Fair Dealing. I also love the idea of taking action to have Harvard Business Review dropped from the FT Top 45.
I hope this one doesn't slowly sink away before the right thing is done!
Update a few minutes later: Somehow I missed this last post on the topic at Digitopoly: HBR Responds and I React

Expert panel to look into the state of libraries & archives in Canada
I happened across an interesting article in a recent CAUT (Canadian Association of University Teachers) Bulletin: Expert panel to look into the state of libraries & archives in Canada. "The panel’s final report on libraries and archives is due in the fall of 2014." Don't miss the link at the bottom of the page to http://www.canadaspastmatters.ca/, which has lots of information about the importance of preserving information within Canada.Related articles
