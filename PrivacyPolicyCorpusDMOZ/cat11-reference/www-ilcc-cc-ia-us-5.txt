Privacy of Records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 requires that institutions maintain the confidentiality of student education records.
Academic records will not be released to another person or organization except with the written permission of the student (or parents, if the student is a minor).   Exceptions are staff members of Iowa Lakes with a need to know.
Students' Right to Review
Students have the right to inspect and review information contained in their education records. A student must make a written request to the Director of Records and Registration listing the item or items of interest. The college will comply with the request within 45 days. Further information about the content of the educational record and the right to challenge portions with the student feels are incorrect is available in the records and registration offices at Emmetsburg or Estherville.
Directory Information
Iowa Lakes considers the information listed below to be directory information and will release it unless the student requests the college not to do so by the end of the second week of classes each term: name, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, student status by credits carried, degrees and awards received (including semester honors), and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended.
Any request to limit directory information must be made to the Director of Records and Registration. The college will not notify a student of requests for directory information if the student has requested withholding it; Iowa Lakes will not be responsible if disclosure would have been to the student's benefit. Students not currently enrolled may not restrict directory information.  Directory information is released only on an individual basis; lists of students are not available.
