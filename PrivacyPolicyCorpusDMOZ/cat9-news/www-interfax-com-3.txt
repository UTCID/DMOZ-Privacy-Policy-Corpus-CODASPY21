2. Lawful Basis
We have provided further detail on the lawful reason for processing your personal information below.
Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on your privacy (and right to a private life), unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law.
Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
Consent means that we ask for your consent to specific uses of personal information where we need to. We will collect it separately and make it clear that we are asking for consent.
Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
Public Interest means processing your personal data for the performance of a task in the public interest that is set out in law.
Journalism in the public interest means that processing is carried out with a view to the publication of journalistic material and we reasonably believe that the publication of such material would be in the public interest (taking into account the importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression and information).
3. Do we share your personal information with anyone else?
We may disclose personal data to the Interfax Group and its respective personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, provided that they do not make independent use of the information.
We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. All our third party service providers are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. Activities which are carried out by third party service providers include: CRM management software, website hosting, and IT support.
We share the information incorporated into our Services (and that may include personal data) with our Customers (businesses and organisations with whom we enter into agreements to access our Services). The use of our Services by the Customers is always subject to our applicable terms of service which relate to the particular Service in question.
In addition, we may disclose your information to the extent that we are required to do so by law (which may include to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets, the information we hold may be included as part of that sale, in which case you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Website of any changes in ownership or use of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding that information.
Except as provided above, we will not provide your information to third parties.
4. Your rights in relation to personal data which we process relating to you
We will honour your rights under applicable data protection laws. These rights are not absolute and they do not always apply in all cases.
Ask for a copy of the data we are processing about you and have inaccuracies corrected
You have the right to request from us i) confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data, and if so ii) a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and iii) correction of any inaccuracies.
We will use reasonable efforts to the extent required by law to supply or correct personal information held about you on our files (and with any third parties to whom it has been disclosed to).
Object to us processing data about you
You can ask us to restrict, stop processing or delete your personal data if:
you consented to our processing of the personal data and have withdrawn that consent;
we no longer need to process that personal data for the reason it was collected;
we are processing that personal data (including profiling) because it is in the public interest or it is in order to pursue a legitimate interest of Interfax or a third party, and you do not agree with that processing and you believe there is no overriding legitimate interest for us to continue processing it;
the personal data was unlawfully processed;
you need the personal data to be deleted in order to comply with legal obligations;
the personal data is processed in relation to the offer of a service to a child.
In some cases you can delete your personal data from your account by following the instructions in your account settings.

If (i) we are processing data in order to perform our obligations to you or because you consented and (ii) that processing is carried out by automated means, we will help you to move, copy or transfer your personal data to other IT systems at your request.
Make a complaint to a Supervisory Authority
If you are unhappy with the way we are processing your personal data, please let us know by contacting us.
If you do not agree with the way we have processed your data or responded to your concerns, an alternative is to submit a complaint to a Data Protection Supervisory Authority.
5. Children
We do not use the Website or any Service to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. We will delete such information within a reasonable time.
6. Security
We will take all reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. For example, our databases are password protected and limited to essential employees only. Please be aware that although we endeavour to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
7. Changes
This Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy here and, where feasible, letting you know by email.
8. International Data Transfers
We are established in the following countries: UK, Russia, Germany, Hong Kong, United States and in the course of business we may transfer information (which may include personal data) to other entities in our group in those countries.
Where we transfer your personal information to entities in our group in countries which have not been deemed to have an adequate level of protection under an adequacy decision of the EU Commission, we have put in place specific contracts containing the EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses (the “Model Clauses”) (or an alternative compliance mechanism, such as binding corporate rules) (“BCRs”) to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection, in particular the GDPR.
If you require further information about these protective measures, please contact DPO@interfax.co.uk.
9. Retention Periods
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant purpose, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
