We have created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security and supplement our Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”) for the Site. This Privacy Policy is an agreement between Champion Media and you, as the user of this Site (“you”). It explains what information of yours will be collected by us when you use this Site, how the information will be used, how you can control the collection, how we may change this Privacy Policy, and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information is protected. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, including but not limited to, your name (first and last), mailing address, email address, telephone number, billing information, etc.
All activities which you engage in on this Site are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features or services on the Site which require the information. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service posted on this Site, then you should immediately exit this Site and discontinue using the Site. By your use of this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as to our Terms of Service. The Terms of Service of this Site are expressly incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Privacy Policy.

How We Protect Your Information
Champion Media utilizes commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in line with industry standards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Champion Media or the Site and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Champion Media makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.

User Choices About Your Information
When using our Site you have the choice to update certain aspects of your personal information that you provide.

However, if you have posted or submitted a news story to our Site under a former e-mail address prior to any updates, the previous e-mail address may remain.
Do Not Track Disclosure: Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Champion Media does not currently respond to DNT signals. Champion Media will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us. We encourage parents and guardians of children under 18 to regularly check and monitor their children’s use of email and other activities online.
