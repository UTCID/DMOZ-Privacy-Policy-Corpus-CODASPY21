Our definition of a "Traditional Newspaper"
Generally speaking, our definition is mostly limited to those publications which publish current local area news, local sports, trade area obituaries, letters-to-the-editor, legal notices, AND require a paid subscription. Rare exceptions are made for listing business news publications for major metropolitan areas. Suburban newspapers meeting ALL the above criteria ARE acceptable.
This definition intentionally excludes all non-solicited, freely distributed "shoppers" or "throw-away" type publications.
