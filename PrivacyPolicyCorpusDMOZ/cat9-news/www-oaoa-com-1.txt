This User Agreement (this "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and AIM Media Texas Communications, Inc. ("AIM," "we" or "our") providing, among other things, the terms and conditions for your use of the AIM Media Texas Web sites, (collectively, the "Service"). Click here for a list of AIM Media Texas Web sites that are governed by this User Agreement.
Please read this Agreement carefully. By using the Service you agree to abide by all of the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with this Agreement, please do not use the Service. We may, from time to time, change this Agreement. We will post a copy of the changed Agreement on the Service. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to abide by this Agreement as changed. Any breach of this Agreement may result in termination of your access to the Service, without notice, in addition to the other remedies available to AIM Media Texas.
Ownership
All of the information, content, services and software displayed on, transmitted through, or used in connection with the Service, including, for example, news articles, opinions, reviews, text, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips, video, html, source and object code, software, data, and the like (collectively, the "Content"), as well as its selection and arrangement, is owned by AIM Media Texas and its affiliates, licensors or suppliers (excluding any "User Content," as defined below, which may be owned by others). The Service is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the United States of America and applicable international intellectual property laws.
Use Of The Service
You may use the Content online only, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use and you may download or print a single copy of any portion of the Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided you do not remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from such Content. However, AIM Media Texas does not represent or warrant that use of any Content will not infringe rights of third parties. If you operate a Web site and wish to link to the Service, you may do so provided you agree to remove such link immediately upon our request. The permitted use described in this paragraph is contingent upon your compliance at all times with this Agreement. No other use is permitted without our prior written authorization. Further, you agree not to decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Service in any way that affects a user's experience, and not to use any data mining, data gathering or extraction methods.
Requests to use Content for any purposes other than as permitted in this Agreement should be directed to pp@aimmediatx.com. In certain cases, you may be able to obtain a license to use individual stories that appear on the Service through online functionality we have specifically designated (e.g., to e-mail a story to a friend or to purchase the rights to reproduce a story for other use). In such cases, we will provide the license information or a link on the Content itself. If you do not see such license information or link, you should assume you do not have permission to use the Content.
Protecting Copyrights And Other Intellectual Property
We respect the intellectual property of others, and require that our users do the same. You may not upload, embed, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available any material that infringes any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights of any person or entity. We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Content or other Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C § 512(c)(3) for further detail): (a) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (b) identification of the claimed infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on the Service; (c) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address; (d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and (f) your physical or electronic signature.
