By accessing or using the ADWEEK Applications or Content, you signify your assent to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the ADWEEK Applications or Content. Registration data and certain other demographic information about you are subject to ADWEEK’s Privacy Policy. For more information, see ADWEEK’s Privacy Policy which is incorporated in full herein by reference. Updates to Terms. ADWEEK reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms at any time. Please check these terms and conditions periodically for changes. Your continued use of the ADWEEK Application following the posting of changes to these Terms will mean you accept those changes. Electronic Form/Communications. By accessing the ADWEEK Applications, you consent to having this Agreement provided to you in electronic form and receiving communications from us electronically. We may communicate with you by postal mail, e-mail or by posting notices on the ADWEEK Applications. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirements that such communications be in writing. 2.USE OF THE ADWEEK APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT License. Subject to these Terms and any fees as applicable, ADWEEK grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the ADWEEK Applications and the Content solely for your personal, noncommercial use (e.g., viewing the Content on screen; printing paper copies for personal use or electronically saving limited portions of Content). All other rights are expressly reserved by ADWEEK. You agree that you will not, unless specifically permitted by us (i) copy, display or distribute any part of the Content or ADWEEK Applications, in any medium, without ADWEEK’s prior written consent, (ii) alter or modify any part of the ADWEEK Applications other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the ADWEEK Applications for their intended purpose, (iii) alter any Content or change or remove any copyright or other proprietary notices; or (iv) install, post or distribute any part of the Content on any electronic network, including without limitation the Internet and the World Wide Web, or create a database (electronic or otherwise) using any portion of the ADWEEK Applications or Content. Use of the ADWEEK Applications or Content via mechanical, programmatic, robotic, scripted, spider, manual or any other automated means is strictly prohibited. Unless otherwise agreed to by ADWEEK in writing, use of the ADWEEK Applications or Content is permitted only via manually conducted, discrete, individual search and retrieval activities. You may not conduct any kind of systemic retrieval of data or Content from any ADWEEK Application. Withdrawal. ADWEEK reserves the right at any time to withdraw from the Content any item or part of an item for which it no longer retains the right to publish, chooses to no longer offer for any reason, or which it has reasonable grounds to believe infringes copyright or is defamatory, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable. Registration and Profile Creation. In order to access certain features of the ADWEEK Applications, you may be required to register and/or create a user profile (an “Account”) by creating a username and password and providing certain profile and contact information. We may require or permit you to use your credentials for a third-party platform (such as Facebook or LinkedIn) to so register (a “Social Sign-On”). Your Account shall only be used by you and only in connection with the applicable ADWEEK Application and may not be used in connection with other ADWEEK products. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account and password. Sharing, selling or transferring your Account or password with or to any other person or making it available to multiple users on a network is strictly prohibited. You hereby agree to (i) provide information about yourself as prompted by the registration form that is true, accurate, current and complete; (ii) maintain and promptly update your personal information (by sending an appropriately worded e-mail to legal@Adweek.com to keep it fully up to date); (iii) ensure that you exit from your member account at the end of each session; and (iv) notify ADWEEK in writing of any unauthorized use of your Account or password or any other breach of security at legal@Adweek.com. You agree not to impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or entity, including using another person’s username, password or other account information or another person’s name, likeness, voice, image or photograph. If you provide (or we have reason to suspect that you have provided) any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or there is unauthorized use of your Account or we suspect fraudulent or abusive activity, we have the right, among other remedial options, to require you to use and pay for an additional account for the relevant product and/or interrupt, restrict, suspend or terminate your current or future use of or access to the ADWEEK Applications (or any portion thereof), without notice to you. You shall cooperate with us in any fraud investigation and use any reasonable fraud prevention measures we prescribe. Failure to cooperate will result in your liability for all fraudulent usage. No Interference. You will take no action to interfere with, interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of the ADWEEK Applications or any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment. You may not use the ADWEEK Applications in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any ADWEEK server, or the network(s) connected to any ADWEEK server, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of any ADWEEK Applications. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any ADWEEK Applications, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to any ADWEEK server or to any of the ADWEEK Applications, through hacking, cracking, distribution of counterfeit software, password mining or any other means. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available through the ADWEEK Applications. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any software accessed through ADWEEK Applications, including any proprietary communications protocol used by ADWEEK. Security. ADWEEK has implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. Modification to Services. ADWEEK has the right to modify the ADWEEK Applications and Content at any time in its sole discretion. Your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any modifications made pursuant to this provision, or any policies or practices of ADWEEK in providing its products, services, Content or any ADWEEK Applications is to stop using the ADWEEK Applications as set forth herein. 3.PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS If you purchase a subscription to access the ADWEEK Applications and/or Content (“Subscription”), the Subscription shall be subject to these Terms, as well as any terms and conditions to which you agree at the time of purchase, including applicable subscription fee (“Fee”), payment terms and length of Subscription (“Subscription Period”). If you purchase a subscription pursuant to an applicable product agreement (“Product Agreement”), the Product Agreement may specify the number of user accounts authorized to access the ADWEEK Applications and/or Content pursuant to that subscription (“Authorized Users”). For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Authorized Users will be limited pursuant to and as stated in the Product Agreement, including limitations by number of users or a user’s office location. In such cases, access to and use of the ADWEEK Applications and/or Content by any other third party is not permitted. Any increase to the number of Authorized Users must be approved by ADWEEK in writing and may be subject to additional fees. With respect to all Subscriptions, you shall:
ensure that all Authorized Users accessing the Content are appropriately notified of the importance of respecting the intellectual property rights in the Content and of the sanctions which ADWEEK imposes for failing to do so; use best efforts to protect the Content from unauthorized use or other breach of these Terms; monitor compliance and immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use or other breach, inform ADWEEK and take all appropriate steps to ensure that such activity ceases and to prevent any recurrence; provide ADWEEK with information sufficient to enable ADWEEK to provide access to the Content. Should you make any significant change to such information, you will notify ADWEEK not less than ten (10) days before the change takes effect; and ensure that only Authorized Users are permitted access to the Content. Your right to use the Content is not transferrable. Any password or right given to you to obtain information is not transferable.
Refunds, Late Payments and Taxes.
All fees paid and charges made prior to the expiration or termination of your Subscription, as provided herein, including any advance charge or payment for the Subscription Period during which you terminate your Subscription, are nonrefundable. Termination of your Subscription shall not relieve you of any obligations to pay accrued charges. Your account may be deactivated without notice to you if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount. You agree to pay any outstanding balance in full within thirty (30) days of cancellation or termination of your Subscription to the applicable Content. Prices exclude all shipping, handling and taxes unless stated otherwise. ADWEEK collects taxes at the rate in effect at the time your transaction is completed. If the tax rate changes before the transaction is completed, the new tax rate in effect will apply. ADWEEK cannot accept exemption certificates for purchases made online. Contact customer service at legal@Adweek.com if you believe a transaction may be exempt from tax. Modifications to Fees or Billing Terms: ADWEEK RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND BILLING METHODS, UPON EFFECTIVE NOTICE TO YOU, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE NOTICE SENT TO YOUR DESIGNATED EMAIL ADDRESS. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Subscription by contacting customer service at legal@Adweek.com. Your continued use of the Content following the effective date of a change to fees or billing methods shall constitute your acceptance of such change.
Delivery and cancellations. Where your Subscription or product order involves the delivery of a physical item or items, they will be delivered to the address that you indicate when you place your order through any ADWEEK Application and the risk of damage to or loss of such items shall pass to you at the time of delivery even if they have not been received by you in person. Any times quoted for delivery are approximate only and ADWEEK shall not be liable for any delay in delivery howsoever caused. If you experience any delivery issues, please contact customer service at legal@Adweek.com. 4.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP ADWEEK or its licensors, suppliers or other designees owns all right, title and interest in and to the Content and the ADWEEK Applications (including all materials, including but not limited to all text, logos, photographs, graphics, images, illustrations, designs, icons, photographs, databases, video, audio, software, html, source and object code, algorithms, business logic, modules, programs, links and other materials).
