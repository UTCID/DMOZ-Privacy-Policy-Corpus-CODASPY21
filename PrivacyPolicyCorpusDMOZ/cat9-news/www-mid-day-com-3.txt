The Bombay High Court on September 24 asked Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut to file a reply to actor Kangana Ranaut's petition against the demolition of a part of her office in Mumbai, said it will start final hearing from September 25. The judges said that since 40 per cent of the Petitioner's Bungalow is already demolished on September 9, 2020, and the Bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest and have scheduled the hearing on September 25. The bench has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) H-ward officer Bhagyawant Late to file his reply to the plea. Watch the video to know more
