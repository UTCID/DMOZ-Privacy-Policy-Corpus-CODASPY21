Adams Publishing Group (APG) Privacy PolicyIn the course of providing services to our clients and customers, we may obtain electronic information of various types. We recognize that our customers’ information may be private and confidential. It is our corporate practice and policy to safeguard and protect that information in two primary ways:1. All information received from customers will be maintained in a secure environment, both physically and electronically. Adams Publishing Group has robust electronic security protocols in place that meet or exceed federal standards (such as HIPAA and NIST) for the protection of sensitive and confidential information. Those standards will be followed in the use and protection of customer information.2. Information received from customers will not be disclosed to any outside third parties without the customer’s written or electronic consent. Adams Publishing Group keeps customer personal and company information–such as name or e-mail address– private. It is our policy to use the customer information we acquire for internal business uses only and to enable us to provide products and services to the customer.The only exceptions to the above are as follows:1. If it is necessary to share customer information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.2. If Adams Publishing Group is acquired by or merged with another company, it may be necessary to transfer customer information to the successor company. In this event, APG will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In the unlikely event that APG experiences a security breach involving customer information, we will carefully investigate the incident, notify the customer as soon as our investigation is completed and take any corrective action needed to prevent further incidents
