The East Montgomery County Improvement District (EMCID) and its nonprofit subsidiary, the East Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (EMCEDC), are making $900,000 available to small businesses impacted by mandatory closures and reduced business in response to slow the spread of COVID-19. Offering emPloyers (help with) Essential Needs (OPEN) program provides three types of assistance to struggling companies within the boundaries of the Improvement District.
1) Up to $20,000 loan at 2 percent interest with a term of up to 10 years.
2) Loan guarantee up to $20,000.
3) Interest rate buy-down.
The intent of the offerings is to give businesses the opportunity to continue paying its employees while revenue is down, to pay its bills until government-issued mandatory closures or restrictions are lifted, or keep the business open until federal assistance kicks in.
“When the health crisis started affecting our local community, it became clear that we needed to help. The question was, how best to do that?” said Frank McCrady, President and CEO. “The Board felt we could make a bigger impact by focusing our efforts on our local businesses that provide jobs to our residents. The last thing we want is for our businesses to lay off employees or close.”
The EMCEDC will process all OPEN loan programs.
In addition to the new assistance programs, the EMCEDC deferred loan payments for its current clients for 90 days.
The OPEN loan application is available at www.emctx.com/OPEN.
