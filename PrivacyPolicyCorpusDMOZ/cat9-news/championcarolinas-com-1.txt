End User Agreement Terms of Service
Your use of Champion Media, LLC’s Internet websites (the “Site”(s)) or the products or services offered on those Sites (collectively, the “Services”) is subject to these Terms of Use (“Terms” or “TOS” or “Agreement”). By using the Sites or the Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms.
I. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
Champion Media, LLC (“Champion Media” or “we” or “our”) provides its user portals, including its websites, forums, message boards, comment lines, photos, videos, blogs, and information submission portals as services to you, the visitor, based on its Terms set forth here. The latest TOS can be found at www.Champion Mediamedia.com/terms.
We may modify these Terms at any time without notice to you by posting revised Terms on our Sites. Your use of our Sites constitutes your binding acceptance of these Terms, including any modifications that we make. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement.
When using the Services provided by Champion Media, you are subject to these Terms. Usage of the Services on this Site also denotes your acceptance of the Terms. Some of the Services may be subject to additional posted conditions or terms. Your use of those Services is subject to those conditions or terms, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference. In the event of an inconsistency between these Terms and any additional posted conditions or terms, the provisions of the additional conditions or terms shall control. The TOS may be changed at any time and without direct notice to individual visitors, so it is recommended that you check back with this page at any time you have questions or concerns.
II. REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
In order to view messages on this Site without user restrictions, no registration is required or necessary. In order to post messages or comments on the Sites, you may be required to register or login as instructed in the comments section.
You may also be required to subscribe or separately register in order to access certain content, archives or Services.
III. CONTENT NOTICE
By viewing the Site content, you agree that all content on the Sites and message boards is the responsibility of the person from which the content originated. You agree that none of Champion Media or its affiliates, sponsors or our and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents and licensors (collectively, the “Champion Media Parties”) will be responsible for any content that you or others post or upload. Champion Media does not guarantee the truthfulness, quality or accuracy of its content or any third party content. While using the Site, you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive or objectionable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except where prohibited by law, neither Champion Media nor the Champion Media Parties shall be liable or responsible for, and you hereby forever discharge and release Champion Media and each of the Champion Media Parties from, any harm, damages or losses that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with any content on the Sites.
IV. ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITY
Users are solely responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others. You are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not to use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site.
Although it may be acceptable for users to maintain multiple accounts, Champion Media may track and consider multiple shared accounts originating from one or more computers as one account when determining if one or more TOS violations have occurred. If the TOS is violated severely enough to warrant the banning of one account, all known accounts shared by one or more users who use the same computer may also be banned at the administrators’ discretion.
It is highly recommended that users do not share their accounts or their computers used to access the Site with others, as the actions of another person may directly impact all known shared message board accounts.
V. PRIVACY AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION
Under normal circumstances, Champion Media will not release the information you provide to us through the Sites or the Services to any third party without your consent. However, if TOS violations or potential illegal activities have occurred or may occur (as so determined in Champion Media’ sole discretion), or if Champion Media is required by applicable law, regulation, rule or process, we reserve the right to release and disclose any and all information we have about you and your accounts, including information that was furnished by you, to law enforcement or governmental authorities, your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), your email service provider, any person that has provided you with internet access (including libraries, schools, and places of employment or others) or any parties whose intellectual property rights have been infringed (actually or allegedly) by your actions.
You certify that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any content to Champion Media. You certify that you have the permission of others who have contributed to or are featured in any of Your Content. If there are any individuals under the age of 18 in any photos, video, or other content that you submit, you must obtain the permission of each such individual’s parent or legal guardian prior to submitting the content.
