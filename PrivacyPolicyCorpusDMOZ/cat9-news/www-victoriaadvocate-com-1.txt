Prior to collecting any personal information about a child under 13, the Victoria Advocate makes reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the child's parent after informing the parent about the types of information the Victoria Advocate will collect, how it will be used, and under what circumstances it will be disclosed.Although the Victoria Advocate will apply these children's terms and conditions whenever it becomes aware that a user who submits personal information is less than 13 years old, no method is foolproof. The Victoria Advocate strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission."Personal Information" collected from children may include any of the information defined above as "Personal Information" with respect to general users of the Web site and may be used by the Victoria Advocate for the same purposes.
