Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 1, 2010
At The Examiner Corporation, we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. Our policy is divided into two sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of The Examiner Corporation Web site. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of The Examiner, Jobs Today, Beaumont Business Journal, and Port Arthur Business Journal newspaper. We also encourage you to review our Terms of Service for information regarding rights, usage, trademarks, licenses, liability, trademark, and content ownership.
We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:

We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site` will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.
