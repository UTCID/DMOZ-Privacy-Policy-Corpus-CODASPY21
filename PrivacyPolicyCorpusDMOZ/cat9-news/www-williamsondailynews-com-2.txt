Welcome to the website for Williamson Daily News newspaper, williamsondailynews.com (the “Site”). The Site is an online service owned by HD Media Company, LLC (the “Company” or “us”). This Privacy Policy discusses our privacy practices with respect to the Site, online and mobile applications owned by the Company related to the Site or to Williamson Daily News newspaper, and any other services of the Company that display this Privacy Policy (collectively with the Site and the applications, the “Services”).We recognize that many visitors to our Site and users of our applications are concerned about the information that they provide to us or that may be collected, and how we treat that information. In order to address those concerns we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, share, disclose or otherwise process the personal information we hold about you.  A. PERSONAL DATAAmong other things, this Privacy Policy addresses how we collect, protect and use your “personal data,” which is information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a person.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” may include not only your personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, birthdate, facial photograph, and credit card information; but also online identifiers such as your computer’s IP (Internet protocol) address, geo-location information, and other information which by itself would not allow us to identify you, but which when combined with personally identifiable information may allow you to be identified.  These online identifiers are only considered “personal data” under this Privacy Policy when they are or may be combined with your personally identifiable information. B. COLLECTION OF INFORMATIONRegistration, Forms, and Other Times You Actively Provide Your Personal Data to UsWe collect personal data about you when you actively provide it to us; for example, when you fill in your contact information in a form to open an account with us, submit comments in response to one of our stories (we may require that you include some identifying information with your comments), submit photos or other information to us, sign up to receive information from us, subscribe to the Services, enter a contest, respond to a survey, make a forum submission, email us, send us a text message, purchase something through the Services, or at other times in which we alert you that you must submit personal data.Information from DevicesWe may also collect personal data automatically from your mobile device, laptop or other device when you use that device to interact with our Site or use our Services.  The information we collect from the device may include the IP address and geo-location of the device.  It may also include such information as which pages on the Site you accessed using the device, what information is downloaded, what type of device, browser and operating system are being used, which Internet service provider is being used and other information of this general type.  We may also collect information from cookies, web beacons, or other trackers placed on your device (see the section on “Cookies and Online Tracking” in this Privacy Policy for more information about our use of these trackers).  We, or third parties that provide or operate services on or through our Services, may also track information about users’ online activities over time and across different websites.  By itself, the information we collect from devices does not allow us to personally identify you (you may not even be using the device – you might have loaned it to a friend), but when combined with other personal data, it may allow us to identify you. Social Media LoginIf you log in to our websites or online services through a third party site, such as Facebook, that site may pass information to us, such as user ID, name associated with the ID, email address and location, plus other information permitted under the privacy policy for that website. Our Services may also return information about you to that social networking site regarding your log in, such as which of our websites or apps you visit and your use of the social media services on those websites and apps.If you log in with or connect to our Services using social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by their privacy policy. If you do not want your personal data shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your account with us, and do not participate in social sharing on our Services.Public Information and PostsAny personal data that you post or submit to our Site or Services, such as when posting comments in response to stories, submitting photos or videos, or engaging in forums or chat rooms, may be collected by us, and may be viewed by other people (including search engines), over whom we have no control. You are responsible for the information you choose to post or otherwise make available in such public areas, and you acknowledge that this information may be collected and used by third parties.Payment ProcessingIf you purchase something through our Services, we may collect your name, address, credit card information, and other personal data in order to process the purchase, deliver the goods or services that you purchased to you, and handle any other issues related to your purchase.  If you use third party payment providers, such as PayPal, to pay for or receive payment from us, that site may pass information to us including your name, email address, billing or other address, phone number (if applicable), date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, whether you have been verified to have control of a bank account and any other information you agree they can share.Advertisers and Other Third PartiesSeveral features of the Services, such as advertisements, classified ads, contests or sweepstakes, polls or surveys, and blogs, may be provided or operated by third parties. These third parties may also collect your personal data in order to use their services.  For example, when you visit our Site or use our Services, advertisers or advertising intermediaries may select and display advertisements to you on your device.  These companies may collect information from your device to help select which advertisements that they believe are more relevant to you. They may also use this information to tell advertisers that the advertisements have been delivered and seen.  Please check their privacy policies for information about their privacy practices. You can also find out more about how they collect your information in the “Cookies and Online Tracking”section of this Privacy Policy.  In some cases these third parties may provide your personal data to us when there is a legitimate interest to do so.  AffiliatesOur Company has a number of affiliates.  A list of them can be found at this link: http://hdmediallc.com.  Our affiliates may sometimes share the personal data that they acquire with us when they have consent or there is a legitimate interest in doing so. Other SourcesWe may also obtain online and offline information about you from other organizations that have your permission or where there is a legitimate interest in sharing your personal data with us or companies like us. We may combine this with information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy.C.

We may also use cookies, web beacons, and other technology to help us recognize your computer/device and help us understand where our users go and how much time they spend there. We may also use these technologies, as well as geo-location technologies, to deliver content that is customized to you. If you do not wish to have us collect and use information collected from cookies, you should disable cookies on your computer/device.

For more information about how Google collects and processes your data, please visit: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

This information will not identify you directly without your consent.

To opt-out of having your information used for audience insights, please email privacy@hdmediallc.com.Detect Ad Blockers. When you visit the Site, we may check (using cookies, code, script or other technical means) to see if you have an ad blocker installed on your device or if your internet browser settings allow advertisements.

If you continue to use an ad blocker this may have an impact on the content you are able to see on the Site.Allow Third-Party Advertising.In some instances, targeted advertising may be displayed on the Site by third parties. Please be aware that the Company’s advertisers, business partners, sponsors, service providers, vendors and third parties accessible through the Services (such as via links from the Site and/or through Facebook Connect) may have their own privacy practices. The Company is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of the third parties when providing information to them. These third parties may provide your personal data to the Company and may also use the information in accordance with their own privacy practices. Provide Co-Branded Services and Features.We may offer co-branded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions, together with a third party and may share the information you provide with that third party with your consent. These co-branded services may be hosted by the Company or by the third party. In these instances the third party may also be a data controller for your information. In this case, the third party’s use of your information will be governed by their privacy policy, which you should always read. To opt-out of sharing your information with such third parties, please email privacy@hdmediallc.com.Disclose Information as Permitted or Required by Law.Your personal data may be disclosed where we are permitted or required by law to do so, such as pursuant to a court order, warrant, subpoena, or discovery request.

Permission to do so is implicit in providing financial details to process payment. Direct debit or continuous payment authority information, including card details, may be retained in accordance with our regulatory requirements, by us or our payment processors for ease of renewal of services. Additionally, we may receive updated payment details from your bank or payment provider from time to time, which we may use to ensure that your details are kept up to date and to allow us to take future payments. Financial institutions, such as those which process credit card orders, are subject to federal privacy laws. If we provide a service to you that is dependent on age or residency, and we have an obligation to verify this information, then we may pass your details to a third party to carry out the verification for us.Ensure Our Products and Services Conform With Industry Standards.We may share your personal data with auditors for the purposes of verifying that we comply with relevant standards. This may require them to access your information in our systems.Share Between Our Affiliates for Analytics, Analysis, Audience Insights, Business Efficiencies, Content Personalization, and Delivery of Relevant Advertising.The Company may rely on our legitimate interests as an advertising-funded organization to share your information with our affiliates to perform analytics and analysis of how you interact with the Site, develop relevant products and services, deliver more relevant advertising and show you relevant affiliate content.

CHILDRENCollection of Information.  The Company does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 through the Services unless such collection is done in accordance with the law. If you are a child under the age of 13 that intends to submit information to the Company through the Services, you must obtain your parent’s consent prior to making such a submission. In the event that the Company obtains actual knowledge that you are a child under the age of 13, the Company may require that you (and/or your parent) prove to us your prior parental consent. Even if you are 13 or over, we recommend that all children under the age of 18 obtain parental consent prior to the submission or purchase of anything through the Services. To obtain a parental consent form, please contact privacy@hdmediallc.com. Parental Options and Review.Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child’s personal data without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties (subject to the Company’s protection of itself and others, disclosures for legal reasons, and the Company’s current technological capabilities). In addition, parents can review the personal data provided by their child under the age of 13, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information (subject to the same items as above). In order to make these requests, parents should email a detailed request to privacy@hdmediallc.com or follow the procedures set forth in the “Opting Out / Withdrawing Consent for Processing” section of this Privacy Policy. Please note that, while the Services will not require more information from children under 13 than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity or event, deletion of required information (such as information that would permit the Company to contact the winner of a contest) may result in termination of the child’s participation in an event or activity. Parents should also note that the official rules for contests and promotions on the Services may contain additional information related to their children’s privacy and the parents’ rights and responsibilities.I. GDPR COMPLIANCECompany Does Not Target EU Users.  Company does not presently have an office in Europe, accept sales in the currency of an EU country, market in the language of an EU country (other than English, the language of Company’s country), provide translation in the language of an EU country, or have a domain suffix for an EU country.  Nor does Company actively offer shipping services to an EU country, engage in monitoring the behavior of EU residents, or otherwise actively target customers or consumers in the European Union.  Nevertheless, Company has incorporated certain provisions into this Privacy Policy in an effort to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).Additional Rights of Users in the EU.If you are an individual in the European Union, you may request a copy of your personal data from the Company and you may have the right to not be profiled. You can also ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal data. In some circumstances you may be able to ask us to transfer information you have provided to us to another organization. Similarly, you may be able to transfer your information from another organization to us, but you should check with us first to confirm this is possible. You may also have the right to object, erase, or restrict our processing of your information – for example, where we process personal data because this is in our legitimate interests, you may object to this. We will need to carefully consider your request, as there may be circumstances which require us, or allow us, to continue processing your data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@hdmediallc.com. These rights may be restricted by law, for example we may not be able to provide a copy of your data where the data we hold is also the data of a third party and it is not reasonable to disclose this information.  Please note that we may seek confirmation of your identity before releasing any personal data to you or making changes to your account.J. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTSCalifornia residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  California residents who are registered users of the Services and are under the age of 18 are entitled, in accordance with California law, to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post on the Services. You may request such removal by emailing us at privacy@hdmediallc.com.  In your request, please provide a description of the material that you want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material, and include your name, email address and/or Site user name, year of birth, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code), and the subject line “California Removal Request” so that we can process your request. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material. For example, some information that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party or may be retained for legal reasons.K. COOKIES AND ONLINE TRACKINGThis section covers our use of cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, Local Shared Objects (“Flash cookies”) and HTML 5 Local Storage.  We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality to our Services, or that measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you on the Site or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience. Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.Local Storage and Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found at https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.How to Disable Tracking Technologies.If you wish to disable cookies and other tracking technologies, please refer to your browser’s help menu to learn how to disable them. Information about how to disable Flash cookies is set forth above. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  The Services currently do not take action in response to these signals.  Please note that disabling cookies and other tracking technologies may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services. L. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICYThis Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time, so we encourage you to check back with every visit to the Services. If you do not agree to one or more of the changes, you may choose to “opt out,” using the “Opting Out” procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy. Once the change has been made, all information collected by the Services after the change will be subject to the new terms of the Privacy Policy. In addition, if you affirm your agreement to this Privacy Policy, such as by clicking “I agree” when asked if you agree to be subject to this Privacy Policy or the legal terms of the Services, then all information collected prior to the change will also be subject to the new terms.
