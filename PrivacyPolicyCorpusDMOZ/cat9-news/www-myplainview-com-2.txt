The Floydada Collegiate Independent School District is asking for help with complying with guidelines instituted by the University Interscholastic League for sporting events.
In a Facebook post posted on Friday morning, FCISD stated that the district was reported to the UIL for not following certain health and safety guidelines put in place to help slow the spread of the coronavirus during the Whirlwinds’ Sept. 4 homecoming football game against Kermit.
The UIL contacted FCISD on Sept. 8 regarding the allegations. The social media post states that 719 people were admitted on the home side and 204 on the visitor side in the Sept. 4 contest.
According to UIL rules, anyone over the age of 10 in attendance at a UIL-sanctioned event must be wearing a face covering of some kind. Exceptions include: those with a previous medical condition; consuming food or drink; and/or while maintaining six feet of distance from other people outside of their party.
Each school must also limit capacity to 50 percent attendance. FCISD has also moved the band into the end zone to allow for more social distancing.
The district said that in an effort to cut down on attendance, it will add zip ties to seats in the middle section of the home stands to expand social distancing even more. However. At a sub-varsity game on Thursday night, those zip ties were cut by somebody to sit in those seats.
The district closed the post by asking fans to help adhere to the guidelines set by the state and the UIL to keep sports going for Floydada.
