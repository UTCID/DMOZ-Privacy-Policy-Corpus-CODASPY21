Privacy Policy
We respect your privacy.
Common Dreams respects the privacy of our members, supporters and all visitors to our web sites.
Information provided voluntarily by you will never be sold, rented, exchanged or otherwise disclosed to any other organization. Period.
E-mail is an increasingly powerful political organizing tool. Unfortunately, many for-profit, and even some non-profits, abuse e-mail recipients with a flood of unsolicited e-mails. They do not share our values -- and, we believe, do great harm to the potential of this communication tool. We will never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy.
If you share our concerns about internet privacy issues, please support The Center For Democracy & Technology.
