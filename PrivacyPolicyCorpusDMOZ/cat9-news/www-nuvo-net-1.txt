NUVO will gather personally identifiable information about you only when you provide it voluntarily for specific purposes such as posting an ad or signing up for an e-mail newsletter.To see what folks like and don't like on our site, we track how our visitors use nuvo.net. We may also collect your personal information from your registering for contests, surveys and newsletters; this can include contests, surveys and newsletters. We won't, though, release your e-mail address or name or any other personal information to anyone else outside NUVO unless we have your consent - or, in those rare cases when we are under a legal order to do so, or there's an emergency involving danger to a person or property. So, in other words, we won't provide our advertisers or anyone else outside NUVO with any of your information specifically unless you've given us your consent to do so. If you do choose to provide your personally identifiable information for the purposes of a third-party survey, contest, or newsletter, your consent shall be deemed to be given for the release of your personally identifiable information with regard to that third party only, in addition to NUVO. The NUVO employees or consultants allowed access to personal information about you are ONLY those who need to have access. Any employee or consultant who violates these policies is subject to possible termination or prosecution – or other disciplinary action.Sometimes, third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures perform functions on our behalf, such as shipping or stocking orders, credit card processing, providing customer service, etc. These third party entities are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of this personal information. They can't use or alter this data in any way other than to provide the Site's requested services. Cookies"Cookies" is the term for the small text files that allow Web sites to store and retrieve information about you from your computer system. NUVO in fact does serve cookies to track individual site usage - but we don't use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer - other than the information originally sent in a NUVO cookie (for example, a user code). As for how our advertisers use cookies that originate from their Web site, we have had no control over that. You can always decline our cookies - if your browser permits, but our site's features may become limited to you, and so we'd recommend that you leave them turned on.It's a fact that all computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. NUVO collects IP addresses to figure out, for example, how many visitors we have, so we analyze our site to retrieve aggregate, non-personal information. When you access our site, our servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. However, to maintain our users' anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information.We will not use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve any personal information from your computer. Communications from UsOccasionally, we send you info, announcements or updates about the site, NUVO or our partners. If you don't like it you can terminate these newsletters, subscriptions, contest results, survey inquiries, etc. with a simple "opt out" procedure. All you need to do use the "unsubscribe" function or link, or email editors@nuvo.net, and we'll remove your name from that mailing list. Giveaways and ContestsWhen it comes to giveaways or contests on our site, if you sign up to be eligible, your info will be shared with the advertiser or sponsor of that giveaway or contest - BUT ONLY for one-time use to notify you if you have won. The giveaway or contest may have its own terms that in fact conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy; if so, the terms of the giveaway or contest shall govern. Note that personally identifiable information will be collected ONLY if you voluntarily submit it to us or our sponsors. Unless you've given us permission, we will not use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than the administration of the contest or giveaway.ChildrenChildren under the age of 13 should not use this site. We don't target our site toward children under the age of 13 nor can we screen them from using the site. Some of NUVO's material on this site is for mature audiences, and parents and guardians should take responsibility for monitoring their children's use. NUVO doesn't collect or distribute information that indicates whether a user is a child. Links to Third-Party SitesNUVO is not responsible, nor shall it be held liable for, the content, services or products provided on third-party websites, nor for the practices of any third party.  We are an e-family: we provide links and pointers to Web sites maintained by other organizations. We do this as a convenience to users, but we don't control, operate, or endorse such sites. We also disclaim any responsibility for info on those sites and any products or services they offer; and, of course, we cannot vouch for their privacy policies. In addition, we don't make any representations or warranties that any linked sites (or even OUR site) will function without error or interruption, that any defects will be corrected, or that these sites and their servers are free of problems that could harm your computer, including viruses. TheseThese Terms of Use apply solely to NUVO’s Websites. You should always review the terms and conditions of any website that you access through a link from this or any other NUVO Website. E-commerce and Our Secure ServerOur secure server processes commerce transactions with every reasonable effort to insure that your personal information is protected.
