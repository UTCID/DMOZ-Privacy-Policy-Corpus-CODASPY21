The BeFrugal Add-On may cause an information bar to appear when you visit a merchant website, and may notify you that the merchant website has cash back, coupons, or deals available via the BeFrugal Add-On. If you click on the information bar, you may be taken to the merchant website. If the information bar appears, you need to click on the information bar to get the cash back indicated. Any cash back earned will be subject to the Terms of Service of BeFrugal and corresponding merchant affiliate programs. Additionally, when you visit a merchant website, the BeFrugal Add-On may offer a dropdown list of coupon or promo codes as suggestions.
If you are a BeFrugal member, when you visit certain participating merchant website(s), such as by typing in the URL or by clicking on a link (including those on a search engine results page), the BeFrugal Add-On may redirect you through an affiliate network site to the merchant website, and a tracking cookie may be placed in your browser. This cookie is used to track any transaction or purchase through the merchant website and appropriately credit your BeFrugal account with cash back.

Payment Terms:
BeFrugal is responsible for maintaining and tracking member's Cash Back and Bonuses. Cash Back earnings are calculated as the net sale amount (total sale adjusted for taxes, shipping and other fees) multiplied by the retailer's Cash Back percentage amount noted on BeFrugal.
Members will receive payment via check, Check, PayPal, Direct Deposit, Venmo, Zelle or eGift Card. Payment via PayPal and Amazon gift card is available for all members. Payment via direct deposit, check or non-Amazon eGift Card is available for members residing in the US only.
A member's payable account balance must reach a minimum withdrawal amount listed next to each payment method in order to be eligible for payment. Members may accept these updated Terms and Conditions to request a PayPal or Direct Deposit payment on any verified balance of $0.01 or greater.
For lost checks, please contact us to request a stop payment. We will waive the stop-payment fee for the first lost check. For any subsequent lost checks, a $10 fee will be assessed.
There is typically a 0.50% (or 0.005) fee on the total payment amount charged by PayPal to process international transactions. In instances when this international fee is charged on the PayPal transaction, it will be deducted from that member's Cash Back balance.
U.S. mobile phone number is required for Venmo and Zelle payment methods. See Venmo terms here or Zelle terms here.
BeFrugal members who elect to receive their payment via a eGift Card will get a cash bonus added to their payment request. Bonus amounts are specified next to each eGift Card payment method on the Payments page of the account.
Cash Back payments will be sent to members on average within 1 business day of payment request.
Payment requests can be made once every 15 days for amounts exceeding $25, or once every 30 days otherwise
For eGift cards we are unable to re-issue an eGift card payment once it has been processed.
Members will need to contact the retailer or vendor for any eGift card issues once payment has been processed.
Member's balances are segregated and held in a restricted cash account maintained by BeFrugal.
General Terms:
Members are responsible to keep their BeFrugal account information current.
Depending on the tax laws in your city, state or country, members may be taxed on
referral bonuses and prizes earned through BeFrugal. In all instances, members are
solely responsible for any tax liability from your usage of BeFrugal.
BeFrugal is not responsible for any lost mail or checks.
For any re-issued check a stop payment fee will be incurred.
BeFrugal is not responsible for changes made by retailer stores participating
in the Cash Back program
BeFrugal protects your privacy and strongly suggests that you
click here to review our privacy policy
BeFrugal reserves the right to withhold payment of Cash Back rewards for suspected fraud,
abuse of retailers or BeFrugal website, use of email spam to promote referrals, or for creating
multiple user profiles. If you feel your Cash Back rewards are being withheld in error,
please contact us. Any fraud or abuse relating to earning or receipt
of Cash Back rewards, or any misrepresentation of information furnished to BeFrugal or its
retailers partners by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your
BeFrugal account and forfeiture of Cash Back rewards.
The determination of whether or not a purchase qualifies for Cash Back is at the sole
discretion of BeFrugal. If a retailer fails to report a transaction to BeFrugal or
withholds payment to BeFrugal, BeFrugal reserves the right to cancel the Cash Back
associated with that transaction. BeFrugal is not responsible for lost or stolen payments,
or for payments delivered to the wrong address.
BeFrugal members are not permitted to use any paid promotional method for soliciting Cash Back
sales through their BeFrugal account or to earn referral bonuses.
This includes, but is not
limited to, ppc ads through networks such as Google AdWords or Bing AdCenter, Facebook Ads, Twitter
Ads, email marketing, banner advertising, content/display ads, and retargeting.
Any member in violation of this policy will have their account banned and will forfeit all Cash
Back and referral bonus earnings.
Termination:
Termination of any account without a notice can be made at BeFrugal's discretion.
BeFrugal membership is free and there is no charge for Membership or for earning Cash Back. However, if your account is inactive for more than 365 days, it becomes dormant. BeFrugal reserves the right to debit dormant accounts $2.00 per month for maintenance until the account balance reaches zero. You will not be charged a maintenance fee if such a charge were to cause your Cash Back account balance to be negative. Also, if you have not been charged a maintenance fee in the month due, you will not be charged retroactively.
You can reactivate your dormant account by starting a shopping session via BeFrugal or via BeFrugal's applications. Once your account is reactivated, all maintenance fees can be voided by contacting BeFrugal support.
Cash Back Discrepancies:
If a member believes that Cash Back has not been accurately reported to his/her account, it is the responsibility of the member to submit a Cash Back inquiry via the BeFrugal customer support ticket form. Cash Back inquiries must be submitted no earlier than 7 days and no later than 60 days after the transaction date.
For most travel-related Cash Back, credit is issued over the course of two transactions. An initial reservation record of $0.00 will post within 7 days of your travel purchase. This indicates that the sale was traced from the travel site to BeFrugal. As a second step, a Cash Back credit on eligible portions of your booking will post within 60 days of completing your travel.
If no reservation record of $0.00 is posted in your account within 7 days of the travel purchase, please submit an inquiry. Such inquiries where no reservation record was posted must be submitted no later than 60 days following the travel purchase.
For purchases that do have a $0.00 reservation record, inquiries may be submitted for a longer period, up to six months following the travel purchase.
Bonuses
Refer-a-Friend Bonus
The details of the current Refer-a-Friend bonus terms can be found here. The terms for the past Refer-a-Friend Bonus programs can be found in the Bonus Activity section of the account.

Members may not abuse the bonus system by utilizing the use of bots, paid advertising, SPAM, fake personas, and/or other suspicious or fraudulent identity.

The member will then need to purchase the specific item from the specific retailer within defined time period to complete offer and earn Cash Back in an amount equal to the cost of the product.
