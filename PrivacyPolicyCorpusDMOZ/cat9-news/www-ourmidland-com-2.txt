Rome may have not been built in a day, but neither was any athletics facility. And that's the message Dow High Turf Team committee member Laura Atton is hoping the community will embrace — that every little bit helps and that every little dollar amount eventually adds up.
According to Atton, fundraising initiatives to support Dow's new artificial turf facility are in full swing and are making a difference a few dollars at a time.
One fundraising project is an ongoing bottle and can drive during which donors can bring their returnables to the school parking lot on Wednesday evenings and leave them at the marching band trailer. Atton said that the drive netted about $1,000 during its first week.
"That was pretty cool. ... The band kids are the ones doing the work on that, and that's what we're trying to get happening — getting the people who have a stake in this (turf facility) volunteering," said Atton, who is also a Dow alum and parent of former Dow athletes.
Another ongoing fundraiser, and one which is near and dear to Atton's heart, is a Jazzercise class held each Saturday in the Frick's parking lot at 9 a.m. During the class, both members and nonmembers of Jazzercise Midland can participate in a workout and make an at-will donation toward the turf project. Atton, who is a former owner and current instructor at Jazzercise Midland, said she began the outdoor classes a couple of weeks ago and is hoping to continue them each Saturday through Oct. 17, weather permitting.
"We actually did a class on a Saturday morning after a frost," Atton said, noting that the first class raised about $1,000. "It was a beautiful morning, and after a couple of songs, people had their (sweat)shirts off, and everyone was sweating by the end of the class.
"It was kind of fun to be able to do socially-distanced workouts," she added. " ... We had been doing some Zoom workouts (during the quarantine), but it's not quite the same when you can't see people face-to-face."
Atton noted, too, that Dow High is not charging for tickets to its fall athletics events but that the school is accepting donations toward the turf project at the gate.
"I think we're going to get quite a bit from that, maybe money that people normally would've spent on tickets," she said, noting than an online silent auction is also in the offing.
Meanwhile, fellow committee member Kurt Ieuter said he has secured a series of "restaurant night" fundraisers, during which local eateries will donate 20 percent of sales on predetermined days to the turf field project. Ieuter said that, thus far, Jersey Mike's, Whine, Dairy Queen, Pizza Dude, Buffalo Wild Wings, Panda Express, and YaYa's have each agreed to hold two fundraisers before Thanksgiving, while adding that he is still seeking more fundraising partnerships with local restaurants.
Ieuter noted a few weeks ago that the cost for materials and installation for the turf field will be approximately $1.2 million and that the committee has already raised $1.4 million in foundation grants and private donations. Approximately another $1.5 million are needed to install such amenities as lights, bathrooms, concessions, and a scoreboard and sound system.
Thus far, Atton noted, over $360,000 have been raised in private donations, and she hopes that trend continues.
"We're just trying to get more awareness out there, because all of these little donations add up," she said.
