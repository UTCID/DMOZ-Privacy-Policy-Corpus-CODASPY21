REGISTRATIONTo access certain interactive areas of the Site you will be required to register with The Times. By registering, you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your username and/or password, and agree not to sell, transfer, or assign your Membership or any of your Membership rights.

The Times reserves the right to terminate your Membership at any time, at its sole discretion, or to deny registration to any person, at any time. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your computer such that others may not access or use the Site using your username, in any format. In the event you believe someone has accessed the Site using your username and password without your authorization, you must notify The Times immediately of such use. Multiple user accounts from a single email address will not be permitted. 2.
