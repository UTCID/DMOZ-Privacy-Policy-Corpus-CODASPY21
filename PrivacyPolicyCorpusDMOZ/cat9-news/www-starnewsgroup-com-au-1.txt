Privacy Policy
This policy outlines how Star News Group uses and manages personal information provided to or collected by it with respect to readers, customers, advertisers and other individuals with whom Star News Group has contact. This policy has been reviewed and modified to meet Star News Group’s obligations under amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 that came into effect on 12 March 2014.
Star News Group may, from time to time, review and update this Privacy Policy, particularly to take account of new laws and technology, changes to Star News Group’s operations and practices and to ensure it remains appropriate to the organisation and the community.
Individual privacy is important to Star News Group and we aim at all times to handle information responsibly. As a media organisation, we handle a very large quantity of personal information and it is critical to the quality of our operation and our position in the community that this information is handled appropriately.
Australian Privacy Principles
The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 includes a set of new, harmonised, privacy principles that regulate the handling of personal information by both Australian government agencies and businesses.
These new principles are called the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which have replaced the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) that applied to Australian Government agencies and the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) that applied to businesses. Under the changes, there are now thirteen new APPs.
The information in this policy sets out in general terms how we comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 and how information should be handled by Star News Group and refers to some specific situations. Where a particular situation is not covered by this policy, please refer to theAustralian Privacy Principles Fact Sheet issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
