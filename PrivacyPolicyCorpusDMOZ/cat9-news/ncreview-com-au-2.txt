North Central Review Editorial Policy
North Central Review Editorial Policy
Accuracy
The North Central Review requires that reasonable efforts are made to ensure accuracy in all content.  The Review requires its journalists to gather and present news and information accurately, according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. News reports must be accurate and not misleading, and opinions be reported accurately through correct quotes.
News and sports stories are presented in a manner that is distinguishable from other material such as opinion pieces.
Integrity and impartiality
The North Central Review seeks to maintain its independence, integrity and responsibility in all forms of news reporting, in accordance to standards of objective journalism and our community.
We do not publishing material which has been gathered by deceptive or unfair means, unless it is sufficiently in the public interest.
The North Central Review ensures that conflicts of interests are avoided or adequately disclosed, and they do not influence published material.
Individuals and organisations who generate and submit content are not required to be impartial.
Fairness and balance
The North Central Reviews strives to present all content with reasonable fairness and balance, and that writers’ expressions of opinion are not based on significantly inaccurate factual material or omission of key facts.
The Review ensures that where an article refers adversely to a person, a fair opportunity is given to that person for a right of reply in the same article or in subsequent publications, if that is reasonably necessary.
Correction and clarifications
In the occurrence of an inaccuracy, the North Central Review is committed to correcting significant errors and clarifying misleading information. Corrections and clarifications, as quickly as possible, can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality.
Privacy
The North Central Review avoids intruding on a person’s reasonable expectations of privacy, unless doing so is sufficiently in the public interest. Privacy is not absolute, and the North Central Review seeks to balance the public expectation in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information. The Review seeks to protect children and young people under 18, and when reporting matters deemed to be contentious or negative will not identify individuals.
