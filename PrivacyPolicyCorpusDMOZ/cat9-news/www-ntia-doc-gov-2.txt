Internet Policy Task Force
The Commerce Department Office of the Secretary, leveraging the expertise of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”), the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"), the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST), and the International Trade Administration (“ITA”), has created an Internet Policy Task Force to conduct a comprehensive review of the nexus between privacy policy, copyright, global free flow of information, cybersecurity, and innovation in the Internet economy.
Recognizing the vital importance of the Internet to U.S. innovation, prosperity, education and political and cultural life, the Commerce Department has made it a top priority to ensure that the Internet remains open for innovation.  The newly created Internet Policy Task Force will identify leading public policy and operational challenges in the Internet environment.  The Task Force leverages expertise across many bureaus, including those responsible for domestic and international information and communications technology policy, international trade, cyber security standards and best practices, intellectual property, business advocacy and export control.
