Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions
Updated 8/23/18
We've adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, as are underlying business models. We reserve the right to change these guidelines at any time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. These guidelines do not apply to the practices or entities that our newspaper’s web site and its affiliates do not control or to individuals who are not under our control.
The following privacy policies, terms and conditions apply to our newspaper and its web site and other Web sites owned and operated by Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC based in Shelbyville, Kentucky.  This policy statement does not apply to those companies' Web sites; please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information on their privacy policies.
Your personal information
Our newspaper’s web site collects personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, etc.) and/or demographic data (zip code, gender, interests, etc.) that you submit when you:
Order a subscription to our newspaper
Complete certain surveys
Register for a promotion or contest or sweepstakes
Send us an e-mail
Place a classified ad
Join a discussion board (you can opt out)
Comment on news stories you send to a friend
This information is encrypted and retained in a secure database, not on a Web site.
We use this information to operate our newspaper’s web site services, to provide you with the highest quality service, and to offer you opportunities we think will be of interest to you. We may send e-mails about selected offers where we inform users about specific offers (from our newspaper’s web site and our advertising partners) that may be of interest to them.
We will not disclose any personal information without your advance permission except when we believe the law requires us to do so, or when it is necessary to protect the rights or property of Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC. In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information -- but only in an aggregate form. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.
We accept credit-card transactions for the newspaper's subscription system. We do not take consumers' credit card information and forward it to third-party suppliers of ordered goods and services.  Our newspaper may use the contact information that you provide to contact you about your account and/or to send you necessary information directly related to the good or service for which you have registered.
Subscriptions
Your subscription includes 24/7 digital access to all content available online.   All EZ Pay options require updated account information including an e-mail address to maintain an active EZ Pay account.  Rates include state sales tax where applicable.  Temporary suspension of your print newspaper delivery due to vacation and other reasons does not extend your subscription expiration date.   *Your account will be subject to a surcharge for premium issues such as the Thanksgiving week issue and special guides/sections.  Notification of the premium issue and surcharge amount will be noted in the newspaper on the day of publication and one issue prior.  Your total bill will remain unaffected but there will be a slight adjustment in your expiration date, unless you have elected the Monthly EZ Pay option.  The premium surcharge will be added to the regular Monthly EZ pay charge in the applicable months that include a premium issue.  If you respond to any subscription promotions that you are not eligible for, we reserve the right to reject your order or prorate your subscription term using non-promotional rates.  Your subscription expiration stop is not automatic. To stop, call customer service at your local newspaper office.
Surveys
Our newspaper’s web site may occasionally use online surveys to ask visitors for feedback on our products and services as well as to collect contact information (such as e-mail address). We may use contact data from such surveys to send the user information about our company or to contact users when necessary. Users may choose not to receive these future, direct communications by invoking the "Opt out procedures" set forth below.
Children's privacy
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act stipulates that Web site operators cannot knowingly collect information from children under age 13 without verifiable parental permission. Our newspaper’s web site respects the privacy of children, and does not seek children's participation in services that require registration. We strongly recommend that parents supervise their children's use of the Internet. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in e-mail messages or forums.
Opt out procedures
From time to time, we may send you information about various goods and services. If you do not want to receive this information, you may send your unsubscribe request via e-mail to the address listed in the email you received.
Correcting and updating your private information
The information you provide to our web site may be stored by us for an indefinite time. However, please feel free to request a change or deletion of this information at any time by sending us an email.
Usage tracking
Some information about you is automatically collected via server logs. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring URLs. We use this information to administer our Web site, help diagnose problems with our server, and to help identify you as a unique visitor to our site and to gather broad information about your site usage. However, in tracking these usage patterns, we do not match this information with a specific user's personally identifiable information.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed in your browser and allows a Web site to recognize you each time you -- as an individual but not your identity -- visit its pages. Our web site uses cookies to track usage of the site. We never give out information to others about individual usage. This is the foundation of our privacy policy. We do provide our advertisers with aggregate information, such as: "100 users saw your advertisement today, and 50 of them clicked on it." We can tell how many users looked at a particular section, how often users come back, and what areas of the site people look at most often and least often.
We may use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this site. These ad network providers like other advertising service vendors, use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer.  In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
Prohibited Uses
This Site is not intended for use by persons located within the European Economic Area (EEA). We do not request or accept personal information concerning or supplied by persons who are located within the EEA at the time they access this Site. If you have accessed this Site from within the EEA, you should immediately discontinue your use. If you have supplied personal information to us in violation of this provision, whether through the registration of new user accounts or otherwise, please contact us at jmford@lcni.com.
Security
The security of the information that you provide our web site is very important to us. We use SSL encryption software to protect your data. However, our Web sites include links to other sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, you should determine their guidelines and privacy policies as we are not responsible, and we affirmatively disclaim any responsibility, for their privacy policies. We are not responsible, and we affirmatively disclaim responsibility, for the actions and policies of these third parties. We urge you to review the privacy policies of these parties when supplying personally identifiable information to them.
Remember the risks whenever you use the Internet
You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information to the public on our web site and its affiliated sites (for example, in electronic forums, chat rooms and other public posting areas), that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot be responsible, and we affirmatively disclaim responsibility, for information that you choose to publicly disclose. Further, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.
Our partners and other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through our newspaper’s web site have separate data and privacy practices that are independent of us, and we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. We encourage you to contact those sites directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.
How to contact us
For any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy, you may contact us at our newspaper, or contact John Nelson, Editorial Director, Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC at jnelson@lcni.com.
