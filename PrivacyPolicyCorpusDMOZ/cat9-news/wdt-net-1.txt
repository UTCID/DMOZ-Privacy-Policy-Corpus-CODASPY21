Please read this Agreement carefully. NNY360, the company that is making the Website available to you (also called the "Internet Service Provider" or "ISP"), may change any part of this Agreement, or any terms or conditions pertaining to your use of the Website wherever located, at any time, without giving you prior notice. If NNY360 does so, it will place a notice describing its action on the Website. Any changes made to the Terms and Conditions set forth in this Agreement become part of the Agreement and apply to all future use of the Website as soon as NNY360 places the notice of the change on the Website. Your continued access and/or use of the Website after the notice is posted constitute your agreement to be bound by and to comply with all changes made to this Agreement. Your failure to comply with these Terms and Conditions may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Website, without notice, and the exercise of other remedies available to NNY360.2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICEThrough the Website, NNY360 provides users with access to a rich collection of resources that may include advertisements that enable NNY360 to provide the Website.
