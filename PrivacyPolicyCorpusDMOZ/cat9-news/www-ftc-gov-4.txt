Protecting Consumer Privacy and Security
The FTC has been the chief federal agency on privacy policy and enforcement since the1970s, when it began enforcing one of the first federal privacy laws – the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Since then, rapid changes in technology have raised new privacy challenges, but the FTC’s overall approach has been consistent: The agency uses law enforcement, policy initiatives, and consumer and business education to protect consumers’ personal information and ensure that they have the confidence to take advantage of the many benefits of the ever-changing marketplace.FTC Policy Work on Privacy and Data SecurityPrivacy and Security EnforcementProtecting Consumers’ Financial PrivacyThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): What Parents Should Know
