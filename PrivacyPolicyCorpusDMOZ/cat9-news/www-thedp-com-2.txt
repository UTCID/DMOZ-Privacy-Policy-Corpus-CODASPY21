In addition, you may not insert any intermediate page, splash page or other content between the RSS link and the applicable DP Website page.
DP retains all copyright ownership and other legal rights in the RSS Content, as well as all ownership and other rights in any logos, trade or service marks used in connection with DP's RSS service. You must provide attribution to the Websites in connection with your use of the RSS feeds.
In its sole and unfettered discretion, DP reserves the right to discontinue or refuse to provide RSS feeds to you at any time and to require you to cease displaying, distributing or otherwise using any or all of its RSS feeds for any reason including, without limitation, your violation or alleged violation of any provision of these Terms, or for any other reason which DP believes appropriate.

General Provisions
These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Waivers to these Terms of Use must be in writing and signed on behalf of DP. The failure of DP to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use and the DP Privacy Policy together constitute the entire agreement between you and DP regarding your use of the Websites, superseding any prior understandings or agreements. *These Terms of Use may be amended or modified only as set forth above.*
