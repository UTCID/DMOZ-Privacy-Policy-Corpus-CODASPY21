to develop new content, products,

to communicate with you about the

to prevent or detect fraud;
to enforce this Policy, the Terms
and Conditions, and any other terms that you have agreed to, including to
protect the rights, property or safety of WNI, its users or any other

purpose.
3.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We may share information collected about you as
follows:
with service providers, including
hosting and storage providers, to perform functions and process your data,
and to help provide the Site;
with payment
processors to process transactions in connection with your use of the
Services;
with analytics providers to help us
understand your use of the Site or Services;
within our corporate family, such as
with subsidiaries, joint ventures, or affiliates, to the extent permitted
by law;
with law enforcement, government
officials, or other third parties: (i) when we are compelled to do
so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; (ii) when we
need to do so to comply with the law; (iii) if we believe in good faith
that the disclosure of your information is necessary to prevent physical
harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity; (iv) to
enforce this Policy or our Terms and Conditions or to protect the security
or integrity of the Site or Services; and/or (v) to defend against legal
claims or demands or to exercise or protect the rights, property, or
personal safety of WNI, our users or others;
with third parties, including buyers or
service providers, if we are involved in a sale, divestiture or
transfer involving all or a portion of the company or its products or
services including: corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions,
bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations or similar
transactions or proceedings. In these situations, information such as
customer names and email addresses and other user information related to
the Site may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred; and
with other third parties, but only if you consent
or direct us to do so.
We may share, at our
discretion, information that has been anonymized so
that it does not identify a specific user through de-identification or
aggregation ("De-Identified Data"), and we do not limit our
third-party providers from using, selling, licensing, distributing or
disclosing De-Identified Data.
4. THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION
Some content or applications on the Services may be
provided by third parties, including analytics companies and advertising
providers. The Services may also include social media features,
such as the Facebook “Like” button, and other widgets, such as the “Share”
button or interactive mini-programs provided by third parties. These third
parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information
about you when you use our Services. The information they collect may be
associated with your personal information or they may collect information,
including personal information, about your online activities over time and
across different websites and other online services. Your interactions with
these features are governed by the privacy policy of the third party providing
it.
You can learn which third parties have currently enabled cookies for
your browser or mobile device and how to opt out of some of those cookies by
visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ or the
Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/. For
more information on mobile-specific opt-out choices, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.
On your mobile device you may have features that allow you to opt
out of some targeted advertising (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS
devices or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android). To learn more about how
these opt-out features work, please review your device settings.
Even if you disable the tracking, keep in mind that you may still
receive interest-based advertising, including from third parties with whom your
information had been previously disclosed and that you may still receive
advertising from third parties, though such advertising may not be based on
your interests and preferences.
The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google
Analytics may set cookies on your browser or mobile device or read cookies that
are already there to collect information. Google Analytics may also receive
information about you from apps you have downloaded that partner with Google.
Google Analytics collects information such as how often you use the Site and
how you use the Site. We use the information provided by Google Analytics to
improve the Site and Services. For more information regarding how Google
collects, uses and shares your information and how to opt out of certain uses
please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. By
using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google as
described here and in Google's privacy policy.
5. HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
The security of your personal information is important
to us. We maintain reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security
measures to protect and limit access to your personal information. However, no
method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage technology is
100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The Site is not
intended for use by children. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 years.
Please contact us if you believe we may have unknowingly collected information
about a child under 13 years of age, and we shall take immediate steps to
delete any such personal information.
7. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
For your convenience, we may provide
links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by WNI that we think
may be useful or of interest to you. WNI does not accept responsibility for the
privacy practices, content or accuracy of other websites. Links to other
websites do not constitute or imply endorsement by WNI of the websites, any
products or services described on those websites or any other material
contained on them.
You are subject to the policies of
those third-party websites, where applicable. Such
third-party websites may have privacy policies that differ from that of WNI,
and third-party websites may provide less security than our Site. Please
review the privacy policies of third-party websites before providing any
personal information.
8.
BROWSER DO NOT TRACK
The Site does not support
Do Not Track ("DNT") at
this time. DNT is a privacy preference you can set in your web browser to
indicate that you do not want certain information about your web page visits
tracked and collected across websites. For more details, including about how to
turn on DNT, visit www.donottrack.us.
9.
CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION
Our servers are located in
the United States. Therefore, your information may be transferred to or stored
or processed in the United States, whose data protection, privacy and other
laws may not provide the same level of protection as those in your country of
residence. For example, government entities in the United States and other
countries may have certain rights to access your personal information.
By using the Site, you understand and consent to the collection,
storage, processing and transfer of your information to our facilities in the
United States and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in
this Policy.
10. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California Civil Code
Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who
are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of
charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to
third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If
applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal
information that was shared and the names and addresses of any third parties
with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If
you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please
submit your request in writing to PrivacyPolicy@westernnews.com.
11. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may make changes to the Policy, from time to time,
in our sole discretion. When we make changes we deem material we shall provide
you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by
sending you an email. In some cases, we shall notify you in advance of the
changes taking effect. Your continued use of any of the Services after the
changes have been made shall constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please
therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to
continue using the Services under the new version of the Policy, please cease
using the Services and uninstall the App from your device.
12. CONTACT US
If you have any questions about the Policy or the
Site, please contact us at PrivacyPolicy@westernnews.com.
