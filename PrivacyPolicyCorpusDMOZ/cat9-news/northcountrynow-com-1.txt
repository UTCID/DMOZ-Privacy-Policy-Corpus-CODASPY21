NorthCountryNow.com Privacy Notice
Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is
important to us.
To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining
our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way
your information
is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make
it available at the bottom of every page.
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on
the
NorthCountryNow.com website. On some pages, you can place a
classified ad,
make requests for advertising information and submit news items,
photos,
links and comment. You can also enter occasional contests. The types of personal information collected at
these pages
may include:
Name         Address         Email address         Phone number         Credit/Debit Card Information
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing a
classified
ad only to complete that order and charge for the ad. We do not
share this
information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
complete
that order.
We use the information you provide when requesting advertising
information
or submitting news items, photos, links and comment only to
confirm the
identity of the submitter. We do not share this information with
outside
parties.
We use information you submit when entering contests to pick a winnner of the contest. If at the time you enter your name in a contest you indicate you would like to receive occasional e-mails from NorthCountryNow.com featuring offers, coupons and special deals from local businesses, your name and e-mail address will be entered into a database used for that purpose. All e-mails will only be sent by NorthCountryNow.com and your name and identifying information will not be shared with other businesses or organizations.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better
design our
website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
advertiser
that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
website, or that
Y number of men and Z number of women entered our contest or took our survey, but
we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
those individuals. Third-party ads, primarily provided by Google, also appear on our website. Google may use non-identifying and aggregate information to serve up future ads based on your browsing history and to relay to advertisers.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described
above without
also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit
such
unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
the correct
use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic,
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect
online.

information

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take
reasonable steps
to verify your identity before granting access or making
corrections.
