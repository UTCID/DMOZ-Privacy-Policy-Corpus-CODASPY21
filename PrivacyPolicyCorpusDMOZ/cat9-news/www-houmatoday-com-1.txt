Thousands of Louisiana Blue Cross policyholders to get a cost breakBy Kristen MosbruckerThe Advocate (Baton Rouge)Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, the largest health insurance provider in the state, expects to offer credits on health care policy premiums totaling $26.7 million across tens of thousands businesses and individuals by the end of this year.The organization said the credits are part of $80 million it has carved out to "support its members, employer customers, providers and the general community" across Louisiana for Hurricane Laura relief and coronavirus pandemic aid."We've had the worst pandemic in over 100 years, the worst economic turndown since the Great Depression and the strongest hurricane to hit the state in more than a century, causing massive destruction and devastation,” said Dr. I. Steven Udvarhelyi, CEO and president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Louisiana.The recognition of that sizable impact on members' lives is what prompted the organization to put the money back into the pockets of policyholders.Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana estimates that 18,000 businesses with health insurance plans through the organization, along with 43,000 individuals who are on Medicare supplement insurance policies, are expected to receive a 15% credit on their premiums in December. The value of those credits is $26.7 million.Across Louisiana, Blue Cross and Blue Shield has roughly 88,000 policyholders, according to state records.An additional 19,000 individuals who were policyholders with the organization in 2019 and have what's known in the industry as a PPO plan, not those with an HMO policy, were already sent rebate checks in mid-September. The individual rebates, part of the Affordable Care Act, total $1.6 million across Louisiana.Another $52 million was dished out by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana for coronavirus and Hurricane Laura relief, which is not associated with existing health care benefits packages.More:COVID-19 could have been in US as early as December, study saysThe organization previously waived any fees associated with cost-sharing for coronavirus treatments, tests and in-network telehealth visits among other policy changes such as waiving prior authorizations, extending grace periods for those struggling to pay premiums and increased access to prescription medications. It has also increased reimbursements, offered bridge funding and issued early payments to providers.The last major economic disaster where the leadership at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana was more flexible with policyholders was during Hurricane Katrina.The credit on insurance premiums is a recognition that policyholders were not using as much insurance coverage as they typically would this year due to concerns about becoming infected by the coronavirus."It's always a risk to give money back but people did avoid a lot of (health) care in April, May and June. ... A decision was made that the spending probably won't catch up" by the end of the year, said Michael Bertaut, health care economist at Blue Cross and Blue Shield Louisiana.The premium credits to business customers reduce the December billing cycle total by 15% of premiums cost and if the company pays annually or semiannually, it is expected to receive a coronavirus credit.
