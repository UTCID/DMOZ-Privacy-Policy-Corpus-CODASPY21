Texas natives Tina Knowles-Lawson and Amber Heard are among the celebrities who have teamed up with Habitat for Humanity Los Angeles to launch the organization's #Hammertime social media campaign. The campaign will raise funds to help build homes for people in the Hollywood community who can't afford housing because of factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Natalie Stone with PEOPLE Magazine.
