A new round of grant funding is opening up in King County to help small businesses and nonprofits impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Seattle Metro Chamber this week announced applications were opening for $580,000 in grants from the federal CARES Act Small Business Emergency Grant Program.
Businesses eligible to apply for the funds include those in King County with 20 or fewer full-time employees. Nonprofits applying can still be eligible if they have more than 20 employees. Organizations can receive grants of between $5,000 and $10,000. Throughout King County, the Chamber expects to award funds to between 60 and 115 businesses and nonprofits.
Applications will be accepted through Monday Sept. 28, and priority will be given to minority or women-owned businesses, as well as businesses in industries most impacted by the pandemic, including hospitality and tourism, air travel and aerospace industries.
The new round of grants come as thousands of businesses in the region continue to struggle due to impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Starting in March, many businesses had to temporarily close their doors due to stay-at-home orders in place to slow the spread of the virus. Since the start of the pandemic, many businesses have also been forced to close permanently.
Local, state and federal officials have been working to get funds to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic, but it hasn't yet been nearly enough to meet the massive need.
Washington has slowly started to reopen over the past few months, but many businesses are still operating at reduced capacities. In King County, which is currently in Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan, restaurants, bars, and retail stores can only be open at limited capacities. Indoor dining at restaurants is also limited to members of the same household.

In July, Gov. Inslee put an indefinite pause on the state's reopening as cases of the coronavirus rose across the state, meaning no county could apply to move to the next phase of the Safe Start Washington plan. In recent weeks, coronavirus cases across Washington have started to decline, but the rate of community transmission is still above the state's target of having fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days.
According to data as of Sept. 16, Washington had about 80 new cases of the virus per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. While some counties are seeing more significant declines in the number of new cases, others have still seen surges in recent weeks.
