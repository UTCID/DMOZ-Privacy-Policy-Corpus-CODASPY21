International Fellows Program
Through its International Fellows Program, the FTC participates in staff exchanges with non-U.S. competition, consumer protection, and privacy agencies for terms of three to six months. International Fellows participate in investigations, enforcement actions, and other projects with FTC attorneys, investigators, and economists. They gain a first-hand appreciation of the practices and approaches that the FTC uses in its enforcement mission, while also sharing insights into their home agencies’ approaches. Fellows return to their home agencies prepared to share what they have learned with their colleagues, apply their experience in their work for their home agencies, and help to improve cross-border cooperation through the relationships they have developed. FTC staff also benefits from the insights shared by visiting Fellows.Since 2007, the FTC has hosted 81 international colleagues in the International Fellows Program. The Fellows have come from agencies in Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, El Salvador, the European Commission, France, Honduras, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mauritius, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Tanzania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Zambia. Fellows have joined FTC teams in our Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Bureau of Economics, Office of Policy Planning, and Office of International Affairs.Through a separate SAFE WEB Interns program, the FTC hosts colleagues for shorter terms. Thirty-five SAFE WEB Interns have come to the FTC from Austria, Canada, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines,Turkey, and Ukraine.Additional Information and how to applyFor more on the International Fellows Program and SAFE WEB Interns Program, and how to apply or nominate an applicant, please review these documents:International Fellows Program brochureInternational Fellows Program details and applicationInternational Fellows and SAFE WEB Interns presentationContact UsMichael ShoreCounsel for International Affairs and Manager of International Staff Exchange Programs
