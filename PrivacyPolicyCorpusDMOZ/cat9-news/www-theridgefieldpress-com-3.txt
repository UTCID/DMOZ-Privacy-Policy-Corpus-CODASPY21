BROOKFIELD — A committee set up to find and address the town’s coronavirus needs has yet to receive a single reply after months of inquiries.
Its members and town officials though are upping their outreach to ensure that anyone who needs help is able to get it.
“I think a majority of it is there is no need, but there could be someone out there who needs our help and isn’t aware of it,” said Mel Butow, who chairs the COVID-19 Long Term Recovery Committee.
The committee was established this summer at the state’s request as a way to connect people in need with the appropriate resources. This includes help finding a new job, getting food and financial assistance. Any money people would get comes from existing state programs, not the town, Butow said.
“Our main goal is to take care of the Brookfield residents,” Butow said, adding he wouldn’t turn anyone in need away and could connect residents from other towns with the appropriate group there.
Most towns in Connecticut have these committees.
The committee has reached out to places of worship, the chamber of commerce and civic groups, such as the Knights of Columbus and the Lion’s Club, to try to identify the community needs.
“We have not been getting any responses,” Butow said.
He said it seems like people are already going to the food pantries, social services and the senior center for help.
Anyone in need can call 203-775-7317 and leave a message so someone from the committee can follow up. People can also email ltc@brookfieldct.gov.

Those reaching out should include their names, contact info and needs so the committee can help. The information will remain confidential within the committee’s six members.
Butow said the biggest need he sees in town is helping seniors feel less isolated since they can’t gather at the senior center due to the coronavirus restrictions. He said the senior center is trying to help with that though and calls its seniors to check in on them.
He hopes people in the community in need will reach out, but said the lack of responses could also be a good sign that there isn’t a need in town.
“It’s a good thing and a bad thing,” Butow said.
