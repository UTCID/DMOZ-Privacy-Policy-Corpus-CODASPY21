AUTO-RENEWAL, CANCELLATION, AND REFUND POLICY
EZ Pay is a convenient electronic payment method that automatically renews your Digital Only or news membership service (your membership).

If you have provided us with a valid credit card number or an alternate payment method saved in your account and you have not cancelled by your Cancellation Date, your membership will be automatically processed up to fourteen (14) days in advance of your Renewal Date and the payment method you provided to us at or after the time of your initial membership purchase will be charged.
We reserve the right to change your membership rate at any time. If you are not satisfied with your membership rate or service, you may cancel your membership at any time, and receive a refund for any amounts you have prepaid beyond the date you cancel your membership.
