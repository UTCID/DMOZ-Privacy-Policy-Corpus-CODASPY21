LOCAL CANCELLATIONS & DELAYS
1. GENERAL RULES AND DEFINITIONS
1.1 If you choose to use the THonline.com service (the "Service"),
you will be agreeing to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement between you and THonline.com, an Internet service of Woodward
Communications, Inc. ("WCI").
1.2 THonline may change, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time,
but if it does so, it will post such changes on the Service, or send them to
you via e-mail or postal mail.
1.3 IF ANY OF THESE RULES OR ANY FUTURE CHANGES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU
MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BY SENDING E-MAIL TO: admin@accessdubuque.com (SEE
SECTION 10.1 REGARDING TERMINATION OF SERVICE). YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE
SERVICE NOW, OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF NOTICE OF ANY CHANGES IN THESE
OPERATING RULES, WILL INDICATE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF SUCH RULES, CHANGES, OR
MODIFICATIONS.
1.4 THonline may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Service at
any time, including the availability of any Service feature, database, or
content. THonline may also impose limits on certain features and services or
restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or
liability.2. THonline CONTENT AND SUBSCRIBER SUBMISSIONS
2.1 The contents of the THonline Internet service are intended for your
personal, noncommercial use. All materials published on THonline (including,
but not limited to news articles, photographs, images, illustrations, audio
clips and video clips, also known as the "Content") are protected by
copyright, and owned or controlled by WCI, THonline, or the party credited as
the provider of the Content. You shall abide by all additional copyright
notices, information, or restrictions contained in any Content accessed through
the Service.
2.2 The Service and its Contents are protected by copyright pursuant to U.S. and
international copyright laws. You may not modify, publish, transmit,
participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in
Section 2.3 of this Agreement), create new works from, distribute, perform,
display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content or the Service (including
software) in whole or in part.
2.3 You may download or copy the Content and other downloadable items displayed
on the Service for personal use only, provided that you maintain all copyright
and other notices contained therein. Copying or storing of any Content for
other than personal use is expressly prohibited without prior written
permission from THonline, or the copyright holder identified in the copyright
notice contained in the Content.
2.4 Certain Content is furnished by the Associated Press and other providers,
which will not be liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions in
any such Content, or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part
thereof, or for any damages arising therefrom.
2.5 You shall not upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish on the message
boards, web logs or other posted comments (the "Forums") any
libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or otherwise illegal
material.
2.6 (a) Be courteous. You agree that you will not threaten or abuse other
Subscribers, use defamatory language, or deliberately disrupt discussions with
repetitive messages, meaningless messages or "spam." Messages written
in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS violate established online etiquette and are not
allowed.
2.6 (b) Use respectful language. Like any community, the Forums flourish only
when our Subscribers feel welcome and safe. You agree not to use language that
abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender,
sexual preference, age, region, disability, etc. Hate speech of any kind, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Telegraph Herald, is grounds for
immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service.
2.6 (c) Debate, but don't attack. In a community full of opinions and
preferences, people always disagree. The Telegraph Herald encourages active
discussions and welcomes heated debate in our Forums. But personal attacks, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Telegraph Herald, are a direct
violation of this Agreement and are grounds for immediate and permanent
suspension of access to all or part of the Service.
2.7 The Forums shall be used only in a noncommercial manner. You shall not,
without the express approval of the Telegraph Herald, distribute or otherwise
publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, advertising or
solicitation for goods or services.
2.8 You are solely responsible for the content of your messages. However, while
the Telegraph Herald does not and cannot review every message posted by you on
the Forums and is not responsible for the content of these messages, the
Telegraph Herald reserves the right to delete, move, or edit messages that it,
in its sole discretion, deems abusive, defamatory, obscene, in violation of
copyright or trademark laws, or otherwise unacceptable.
2.9 You acknowledge that any submissions you make to the Service (e.g. Letter
to the Editor, Photo, Video, Review or Commentary) may be edited, removed,
modified, published, transmitted, and displayed by the Telegraph Herald and you
waive any rights you may have in having the material altered or changed in a
manner not agreeable to you. 3. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE AND LINKS
3.1 THonline contains links to other related World Wide Web Internet sites,
resources, and sponsors of THonline. Since THonline is not responsible for the
availability of these outside resources, or their contents, you should direct
any concerns regarding any external link to the site administrator or Webmaster
of such site.4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
4.1 You represent, warrant and covenant (a) that no materials of any kind
submitted through your account will (i) violate, plagiarize, or infringe upon
the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other
personal or proprietary rights; or (ii) contain libelous or otherwise unlawful
material; and (b) that you are at least 18 years old. You hereby indemnify,
defend and hold harmless WCI and THonline, and all officers, directors, owners,
agents, information providers, affiliates, licensors and licensees
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and
all liability and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising
out of any breach by you or any user of your account of this Agreement or the
foregoing representations, warranties and covenants. You shall cooperate as
fully as reasonably required in the defense of any such claim. THonline
reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
control of any matter subject to indemnification or join with you in such
defense.
4.2 Neither WCI nor THonline represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability
of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or
distributed through the Service by any user, information provider or any other
person or entity. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such opinion,
advice, statement, memorandum, or information shall be at your sole risk. THE
SERVICE AND ALL DOWNLOADABLE SOFTWARE ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.5. REGISTRATION AND SECURITY
5.1 As part of the registration process, you will select a password and a
subscriber ID. You also have to give us certain registration information, all
of which must be accurate and updated. (a) You may not (i) select or use a
subscriber ID of another person with the intent to impersonate that person;
(ii) use a subscriber ID in which another person has rights without such
person's authorization; or (iii) use a subscriber ID that THonline, in its sole
discretion, deems offensive. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall
constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate
termination of your account. (b) You shall be responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your password, which you will not have to reveal to any
representative or agent of THonline.
5.2 (a) You shall notify admin@accessdubuque.com of any known or suspected
unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of
security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or
credit card information.
5.3 You must be 18 years or older to subscribe to the Service; however, persons
of all ages may use it. Thus, you may share your password and subscriber ID
with others, subject to Section 6.4.
5.4 You are responsible for all usage or activity on your THonline account,
including use of the account by any third party authorized by you to use your
subscriber ID and password. Any fraudulent, abusive, illegal activity or breach
of any of the terms of this agreement may be grounds for termination of your
account, at THonline's sole discretion, and THonline may refer you to
appropriate law enforcement agencies.6. FEES AND PAYMENTS
6.1. THonline reserves the right at any time to charge fees for access to
portions of the Service or the Service as a whole. However, in no event will
you be charged for access to the Service unless we obtain your prior agreement
to pay such charges. Thus, if at any time THonline requires a fee for portions
of the Service that are now free (e.g., a domestic subscription fee), THonline
will give you advance notice of such fees and the opportunity to cancel the
account before such charges are imposed. You shall pay all fees and charges
incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in
which such fees and charges are incurred, including, but not limited to charges
for any products or services offered for sale through the Service by THonline
or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and charges shall be
billed to and paid for by you. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to
use of the Service through your account.7. COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THonline AND SUBSCRIBERS
7.1 THonline reserves the right to send electronic mail to you for the purpose
of informing you of changes or additions to the Service.
7.2 THonline reserves the right to disclose information about your usage and
demographics, provided that it will not reveal your personal identity in
connection with the disclosure of such information. For more information please
read the privacy statement of THonline.
7.3 At no time will THonline share or disclose your name, address, e-mail
address, telephone number, or any other personal information with any third
party without your consent. For more information please read the privacy
statement of THonline.8. SOFTWARE LICENSES
8.1 You shall have no rights to the proprietary software and related
documentation, or any enhancements or modifications thereto, provided to you in
order to access the Service ("Access Software"). You may not
sublicense, assign or transfer any licenses granted by THonline, and any
attempt at such sublicense, assignment or transfer shall be null and void. You
may make one copy of such software for archival purposes only. You may not
otherwise copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative
works from Access Software.9. TERMINATION
9.1 You may terminate your account at any time by sending e-mail to:
admin@accessdubuque.com. Upon termination, you will receive a confirmation via
e-mail that the request was received, and your access will be suspended within
24 hours, except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. You are responsible for all
charges incurred (if any) up to the time the account is deactivated.
9.2 THonline may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend your access to
all or part of the Service for any reason, including, without limitation,
breach or assignment of this Agreement.10. MISCELLANEOUS

accordance with Iowa
law. Any action to enforce this agreement shall be brought in the federal or
state courts located in Iowa.
