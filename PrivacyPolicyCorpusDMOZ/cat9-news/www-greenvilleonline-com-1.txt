OPINIONLetter: Why SC must do more to help workers during the pandemicDiane SmockLetter to editor submissionView Comments As the pandemic continues to jeopardize people’s jobs and livelihoods, South Carolina workers have little protection.A recent study published by Oxfam America, the “Best States to Work Index,” assesses and ranks states according to the best places to work during the COVID-19 crisis.Regrettably, South Carolina is among the 10 worst states when it comes to protecting workers from the pandemic.

Furthermore, steps (such as a mask mandate) must be taken to curb the spread of the virus so that it is safe for workers to return to work. Our economy and our lives depend upon it!Diane SmockGreenvilleThe writer held political office in Greenville for 16 years and currently volunteers with various nonprofits, including Oxfam America.View Comments
