Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Mountain News may disclose the Personal Information we collect to third parties for all or part of the above-mentioned purposes. Those circumstances are described below, along with steps we take to limit the manner in which your Personal Information is used.
Advertisers, Sponsors, and Promotional and Business Partner
Mountain News shares and/or sells anonymous, aggregated demographic information (such as gender, age, income, hobbies, and interests), and information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and with participating vendors at sites offering online sales opportunities.  The information obtained from cookies and similar technologies that Mountain News shares with third parties consists of device IDs.
Service Providers
We may share your information with companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card processors, mailing houses, or web hosts) or that help us market our products and services (such as email or text messaging vendors). These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are only authorized to use the Personal Information we share with them for the purpose of delivering the service we hire them to provide. In addition, we only disclose the information they need to provide the specific service or function.
With Other Mountain News Subsidiaries
In order to provide you with services and operate our business, Personal Information we collect may be shared, consistent with this policy, with subsidiaries of Mountain News, including current or future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and entities sharing common ownership with Mountain News. All Mountain News entities are bound to this Privacy Policy.
Partner Promotions
We may feature web pages on which you can register for special promotions or services provided in conjunction with our business partners. When we feature pages like these on our Sites, we will give you a clear notice that you are providing information to another party. We may also arrange to send you marketing and promotional information of other companies that we think might be of interest to you, only if you tell us that you want to receive these sorts of materials. Although Mountain News may receive a fee from business partners for this service, Mountain News sends those offers on behalf of the business partners, and does not share your email address with them. You may opt-out of receiving those offers at any time, as described below.
In Connection with Corporate Events
In the event of a merger, reorganization, acquisition, joint venture, assignment, spin-off, transfer, or sale or disposition of all or any portion of our business, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings, we may transfer any and all Personal Information to the relevant third party. Your Personal Information would remain subject to this Policy.
In Special Circumstances
In certain special cases, we may disclose your Personal Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify or contact you, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, Mountain News or someone else. We may disclose your Personal Information when we believe the law requires it, in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, in response to civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case, governmental authorities or administrative investigation, or in connection with an investigation conducted by Mountain News.
Public Postings
If you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Mountain News Sites or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail address, photograph, etc.), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Mountain News has no control over this use of your personal information.
Links to Third-Party Websites
Our Sites contain direct links to sites offered by third parties (such as partners from which we receive webcam or weather information). Those third-party sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Some of the sites may give you the option of sharing your thoughts, Personal Information, or skiing and snowboarding experiences automatically on their platforms. If you choose to share information with a third-party site such as Twitter or Facebook, the information you choose to share on those sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. You should review the privacy policies of those sites to make an informed decision about whether to share your information. Further, you should review your account settings on those sites to ensure that you are comfortable sharing your information with the audience chosen in that account.

Data Security and Retention
Mountain News has implemented physical, technological, and organizational safeguards and security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure of your Personal Information under our control. We also take measures to protect the Personal Information we disclose to third parties, for example by entering into contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. Please be aware that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  You can help us by protecting and keeping your passwords safe at all times, and not using the same password for different applications or sites. You also can protect yourself and help us reduce the risk of fraud by promptly notifying us if you suspect that your user name or password is lost, stolen or used without permission.
We will retain your Personal Information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. Personal Information that is no longer required for those purposes will be destroyed or made irreversibly anonymous.
Changes to the Policy
We may change this Policy from time to time, and will post the revised Policy on our Sites. The changes will only apply to Personal Information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy. If we make material changes to the way we collect, use or disclose Personal Information, we will notify you by posting a clear and prominent announcement on our Sites or through a direct communication. To the extent allowed by applicable law, your continued access to or use of Mountain News Sites following notice of material changes to this Policy shall constitute consent to any amendments and/or modifications. Where required by law we will provide separate notice or seek separate consent for changes to our privacy policy or practices.
International Data Transfers
Mountain News’ headquarters are located in the United States. Your Personal Information may be transferred, stored or processed by Mountain News entities or third-party service providers located in the United States or other locations around the world as described in this Policy. Data protection standards in those countries may differ from the country where you reside. If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), your Personal Information may be transferred to and/or made accessible from countries outside the EEA. In such circumstances, we will enter into model contractual clauses as adopted by the European Commission, or rely on alternative legal bases such as the Privacy Shield, where applicable, or binding corporate rules (where our partners or service providers have adopted such internal policies approved by European data protection authorities). You may contact us for more information or to obtain copies of the relevant documents. Mountain News’s websites and the servers that make these sites available worldwide are located in the United States and all matters relating to these sites are governed by the laws of the State of California in the United States, subject to the mandatory legal provisions applicable in your jurisdiction.
