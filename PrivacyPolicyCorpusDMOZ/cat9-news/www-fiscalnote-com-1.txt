California Privacy Rights
Last Date of Revision: Jan 30, 2020.
1. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 1, 2020, gives California consumers enhanced rights with respect to their personal information that is collected by businesses.  First, California consumers may opt out of having their personal information sold to other persons or parties. Second, they have a right to know:
1.     What specific pieces of information a business has about the consumer;
2.     Categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer;
3.     Categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
4.     Categories of personal information that the business sold or disclosed for a business purpose about the consumer;
5.     Categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
6.     The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.
In addition, California consumers can request that the personal information a business has collected about them be deleted from the business’s systems and records.
FiscalNote may be considered a covered business under the CCPA as it collects and processes the personal information of California consumers. This Privacy Policy provides the required notices to California consumers.  The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from providing discriminatory treatment to California consumers if they exercise their rights under the Act.
FiscalNote does not presently sell any personal information to third parties for any purpose.
To make a "request to know" or "request to delete" your personal information, send us an e-mail at privacy@FiscalNote.com (Please put either “Request to Know” or "Request to Delete" in the subject heading of your email.)  You may also submit these requests via an online form (available at this link).
We will honor these requests for US individuals whether or not you are a California consumer under the CCPA.
We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days along with a description of what steps we will take to verify and respond. We must provide the requested information or delete your personal information within 45 days of receipt of your request. If necessary we can take up to an additional 45 days, but we must let you know the additional time is needed.
When contacting us, we may ask you to provide certain, limited personal information, such as your name, email address and/or account login ID and/or password, to verify your request and to match with our records and systems. This is also to protect against fraud. We will not retain this personal information or use it for any other purpose.  Also please be advised that we need to search our records and systems only for the preceding 12 months.
Residents of other states may also have similar rights to request information about or delete their personal information.  To inquire about exercising these rights, please contact us at privacy@FiscalNote.com.
2. Pursuant to California’s "Shine The Light law" (California Civil Code § 1798.983), California residents are entitled, once a year and free of charge, to request the disclosure of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, if any.  Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt out of this type of sharing.
You may request this information by contacting us at privacy@FiscalNote.com and indicate in the email subject line, "California Shine The Light Request."  Please include your mailing address, state of residence and email address with your request.
3. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser-based "do-not-track" requests.
