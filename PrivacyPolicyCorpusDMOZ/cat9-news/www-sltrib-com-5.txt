We do not allow comments that include personal attacks, threats, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by characters), commercial promotion, spam, fake profiles, multiple accounts, incoherence and SHOUTING.In addition, a comment may be removed if it is deemed to be uncivil, inappropriate, racist, sexist, homophobic, bigoted, blatant “trolling” or is not related to the topic at hand. While moderation decisions are subjective, our moderators try to be as consistent as possible. Generally, we will not allow comments to become bogged down with discussions of our moderation policy and activity.We encourage opinions and criticisms of our work, however, those criticisms must relate to the articles in question. Personal attacks against Tribune staff will not be permitted and comments of that nature will be deleted.The Tribune does not edit comments but it may respond to comments that contain factual inaccuracies.Well said labelsWell Said labels may occasionally be assigned to a comment and represent kudos from Tribune moderators, an acknowledgement of a well-thought out comment that is applicable to the story. They can also function as a way to highlight different opinions on a topic.Well Said labels are not an endorsement of an opinion or fact in the comment.Terms of ServiceFor more information about comments, user contributions and submissions, as well as how The Salt Lake Tribune can use your contributions, read our full Terms of Service.Contact usIf you have questions about the Tribune’s commenting policy, email comments@sltrib.com.
