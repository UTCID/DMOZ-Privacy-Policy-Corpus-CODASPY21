This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your Personal Data (as defined below) on the Newsmax Offerings, how we collect, use, and protect such data, and the choices you have concerning our use of such data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy represents our current (as of the last revised date, above) data collection and usage practices.

Data Collection
Personal Data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, or phone number (“Personal Data”). Newsmax collects Personal Data from you when you enroll in, subscribe to, or agree to purchase any of our paid goods and services, register for news alerts on the Newsmax Offerings, or voluntarily provide it to us, such as name, postal address, email address, phone number, financial information, employment information, gender, demographic information including age, and information about your personal opinions or beliefs. In addition to information collected during registration, enrollment, subscription, or purchase, Newsmax collects Personal Data knowingly provided by you in e-mails to the Newsmax Offerings, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, polls, sweepstakes, data provided through commenting features, and contest entries. This includes sensitive Personal Data including political opinions, religious affiliation, and health information.
Newsmax also collects “Monitoring Data."

We will not sell, share, license, trade, or rent your Personal Data or other information, other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
Use of Tracking Tools
To enhance the Internet experience on the Newsmax Offerings, Newsmax and service providers it engages may use various Internet technologies such as, ‘cookies,’ ‘web beacons/web bugs,’ ‘action tags,’ ‘.gif tags,’ and ‘JavaScript’ (together, “Tracking Tools”). Tracking Tools are files or tools that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Newsmax Offerings. Newsmax uses these technologies to customize and enhance the Internet experience of individual users. When you revisit the Newsmax Offerings, Newsmax may recognize you by a Tracking Tool and customize your experience accordingly. For example, once you have completed the registration process, a cookie will be used to remember your registration preferences. See the Digital Advertising & Analytics section [insert link to this section] of this Privacy Policy to learn more about the use of this information and the choices available to you. You may decline Internet cookies by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available. If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Newsmax Offerings may not operate as intended. Information about the procedure you are required to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website.
We believe Tracking Tool technologies add value to the user experience, and the information obtained through these technologies is not sold or otherwise made available to third parties by Newsmax, other than as may from time to time be specified in this Privacy Policy.
For more information on our Tracking Tool technologies, see our Cookie & Similar Technologies Policy.

Newsmax may share data with service providers, affiliates, and subsidiaries in connection with the services we provide, including with these other businesses within our corporate family: Humanix Books, Newsmax Broadcasting, Medix Select, and Crown Atlantic. Newsmax uses service providers to provide email and direct mail services to Newsmax.
Newsmax may share the information to unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or to preserve Newsmax’s legal rights in the Newsmax Offerings’ content, whether the same arises from contract or through force of law; (b) to provide you with any services, information, special offers, promotions or products you requested or consented to and to allow us to perform other activities related to such services and products; or (c) to operate these Newsmax Offerings and other of Newsmax’s systems .
Newsmax may share information with a sponsor or other third party that is interested in providing you with products and services (“Third-Party Providers”). You may instruct us at any time not to share your Personal Data with such Third-Party Providers by contacting us in the manner provided under “Your Choices Regarding Personal Data Collection and Use.”
We may share information that has been de-identified or aggregated without restriction.
Newsmax is not responsible for any further use or disclosure of your Personal Data by Third-Party Providers; such use or disclosure is governed by the Third-Party Providers’ privacy policies.
Newsmax reserves the right to transfer the information it collects to successors to the relevant portion of any of Newsmax’s businesses or to independent contractors it engages to assist with or perform on Newsmax’s behalf any of the foregoing activities. Also, if Newsmax’s assets are subject to a claim in bankruptcy, Personal Data and Monitoring Data may be an asset subject to the claims of a trustee in bankruptcy and may be available to Newsmax’s creditors. In addition, Newsmax reserves the right to use Personal Data to contact you regarding your account status and changes to this Privacy Policy or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Newsmax Offerings. Newsmax will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity of the collected data so that it is reliable and appropriate for the foregoing uses.
Activity of Our Business
Newsmax may use the Personal Data you share with us to provide you with the information or product(s) you signed up for or purchased. No Personal Data will be given to any third-party platform for advertising or marketing purposes. Contact information for texting groups will not be shared to third parties.
We may use third-party service providers, such as ad networks, to perform certain advertising activities on our behalf, such as retargeting, but we will not provide them with your Personal Data. Newsmax advertising does not use segments designed to target children under sixteen (16) years of age to serve or optimize advertisements. Newsmax does not use automatic decision-making. We may engage in profiling for targeted marketing purposes.
Digital Advertising and Analytics
We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites and mobile apps. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to the Site, other sites or apps, and elsewhere over time, including that data across associated devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Newsmax adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) in connection with this interest-based advertising activity. U.S. individuals may visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices while EU individuals can visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising by companies participating in these consumer choice tools. You may also use tools provided by mobile operating system providers, such as limit ad tracking, to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device. Your choices will apply to this browser or mobile device. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Sites and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. Newsmax uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use our Site, visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
When you use our website, we share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our partner/service provider, LiveRamp Inc. LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising.

You should review the applicable privacy policies in connection with your use of such third party websites.
The Newsmax Offerings may also include integrated social media tools or “plug-ins,” such as social networking tools offered by third parties.
