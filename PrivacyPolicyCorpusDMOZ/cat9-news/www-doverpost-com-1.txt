Weatherization program helps Delawareans invest in their homesDelaware News DeskThe Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control offers the Weatherization Assistance Program at no cost to qualified low-income families to reduce energy costs.DNREC encourages Delaware homeowners and renters to review the eligibility guidelines at de.gov/wap to then receive a free energy audit. An auditor will determine the services to improve the energy efficiency of the homes. Typical services include air-sealing, insulation, heating system repair, lighting upgrades and minor repairs that are necessary to complete energy-saving measures.Last year, 195 Delawareans benefited from this program, with an average estimated savings of $283 per home per year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.The program will now be available throughout Delaware by Energy Coordinating Agency, which had previously contracted to provide services to 200 homes in New Castle County. Following a recent state competitive bidding process, ECA is contracted to weatherize an additional 200 homes each year in Kent and Sussex counties and, at the start of their contract, has a client waiting list with 100 potential homes. ECA will use two subtractors, Eleventh House Solutions and HELP Initiative, to provide administrative functions.People interested in receiving weatherization services anywhere in the state can contact ECA at 504-6111 or ecasavesenergy.org/delaware-weatherization.
