General
brooksbulletin.com (the “Service”) is owned and operated by Nesbitt Publishing Co. Ltd. and contains material which is derived in whole or in part from The Brooks Bulletin, The Canadian Press and other sources. The Service and its contents are protected by international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws. You may not modify, copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit or distribute in any way any material from the Service, including code and software.

As part of our Service, brooksbulletin.com agrees to provide you with information and other computer services subject to these Terms of Service. You agree to use our service in accordance with these Terms. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change these Terms of Service from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Terms of Service on the Web site. By continuing to use brooksbulletin.com after we post any such changes, you accept the Terms of Service, as modified.
You may establish a hypertext link to this Service so long as the link does not state or imply any sponsorship of your site by brooksbulletin.com. However, you may not, without the prior written permission of brooksbulletin.com, frame any of the content of the Service, or incorporate into another website or other service any intellectual property of brooksbulletin.com, its parent or affiliate companies or its licensors.
License to brooksbulletin.com
When you post a message, upload a file, or otherwise provide us with material for display on the Web site, you are representing that you are the owner of the material, or are making your submission with the express consent of the owner of the material. In addition, when you post a message, upload a file, or otherwise provide us with material for display on the website, you are granting brooksbulletin.com a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to:

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as users navigate through our website. Unless the user informs us otherwise, brooksbulletin.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third party vendors user information (e.g., user name and e-mail address) for purposes such as providing users with information about products and services. If the user does not wish to be included in such uses, the user must send an e-mail or a letter requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or given or sold to third party vendors.
In addition, please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others.
We use “cookies” in a limited way to help deliver advertisements and to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. Some of our business affiliates and advertisers use “cookies”, which can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site. Because we do not control the privacy policies of our business affiliates, advertisers or any other sites to which we may provide hyperlinks, you should check the privacy policy of the site you are visiting if you have any concerns about that site’s use of cookies.
We also make some content, products and services available through our Service through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear prominently on our site. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider directly for more information. In addition, we also participate in online ventures with our affiliated companies and the services brought to you through those ventures may be subject to privacy policies that differ from ours.
Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we, the bulk of our assets or one or more of our sites is acquired by another company, information on our users would be among the transferred assets.
