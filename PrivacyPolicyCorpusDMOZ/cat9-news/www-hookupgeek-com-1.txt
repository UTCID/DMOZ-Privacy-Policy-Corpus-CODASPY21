How we rate hookup sites?To rate the dating and hookup sites, we use the 10 points system, which equals to 100%. The criterion of user-friendly interface and customer service comprise 5% each out of 100%, which is coefficient of 0.5. 20% is given to members number and quality of profiles accordingly with the coefficient of 2. Safety and Anti-Scam and Value For Money criteria constitute 25% each, that’s 2.5 coefficient. Hence, in total, it’s 100%. For example:Having the following points like:User-friendly interface (UFI) 10Customer Service (CS) 10Number of members (NM) 9Quality of Profiles (QP) 8Safety & Anti-Scam (SAC) 7Value for Money (VM) 5a website’s hookup rate would be counted in the following manner:UFI (10*0.5=5) + CS (10*0.5=5) + NM (9*2=18) + QP (8*2=16) + SAC (7*2.5=17.5) + VM (5*2.5=12.5). In total, the hookup rate would be 74 out of 100.By using such formula, we can provide you with the unbiased opinion about each adult dating and hookup web service! Close
