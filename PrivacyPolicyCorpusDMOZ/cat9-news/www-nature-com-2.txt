Editorial policies
The Nature Research journals' (including Nature and the journals with "Nature" in their titles) editorial policies concerning publication of primary scientific research can be found on the pages listed below. A list of these journals and a description of the relationship between them can be found here. In August 2015, the Nature Research journals became members of the Committee on Publication Ethics. We will be guided by COPE guidelines, however the Nature Research journals will continue to make independent decisions based on our existing policies and principles.
