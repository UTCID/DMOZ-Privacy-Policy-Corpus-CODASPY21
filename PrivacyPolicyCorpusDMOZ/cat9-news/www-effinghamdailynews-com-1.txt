**ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY REPORTING OR NEWS INFORMATION**EffectiveThis Policy was last modified on: January 1, 2020PolicyThis California Privacy Policy for California residents ("California Privacy Policy") is provided by CNHI LLC and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "CNHI," "we," "us," or "our"), and applies solely to the Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect and use relating to consumers and users who reside in the state of California ("you," "consumer," or "customer"). This California Privacy Policy supplements our general Privacy Policy and applies to the publications, businesses, and websites operated by CNHI including the website from which you accessed this California Privacy Policy. We provide this California Privacy Policy to comply with California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended ("CCPA"), and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this California Privacy Policy.Definitions Specific to this PolicyThe CCPA includes definitions for terms specific to this California Privacy Policy that do not apply to our general Privacy Policy including the following terms:"Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal Information does not include publicly available information obtained from government records; deidentified or aggregated consumer information that cannot be reconstructed to identify you; any information covered under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the California Financial Information Privacy Act, activities covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."Sale" or "sell" means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration."Service Provider" means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that processes information on behalf of a business and to which the business discloses a consumer’s Personal Information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract."Third Party" means a person or entity who is not a business that collects Personal Information from consumers, as defined in the CCPA, and to whom the business discloses a consumer’s Personal Information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract.OverviewWe use reasonable security measures to protect your information including industry-standard processes for sharing information with third parties. You should note that our webpages may contain links to or content from websites or other online services provided by third parties.The CCPA requires that we use the term "sell" to include even Personal Information-sharing with business partners for operational services. Accordingly, we use this expanded definition of "sell" throughout our California Privacy Policy. When we disclose that we may "sell" Personal Information, it means that we and you may receive some kind of benefit in return for sharing Personal Information, even if no money changes hands.When you visit our webpages, we may use cookies and other technologies to collect information. These technologies help us personalize experiences, understand news preferences, and learn about the devices used to access our sites.To ensure you receive ads relevant to your preferences we and advertisers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps, and devices. We and advertisers may use that information to help understand audience segments. Advertisers may use the segments to determine the audience groups to which they wish to deliver particular ads. The summary provided below describes all information collected on our sites. Keep in mind that collection includes information you provide to us for our services and passive information regarding your activity on our webpages. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, but opting out does not mean you will no longer receive advertising. It means that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences.The Personal Information We Collect and DiscloseWe may have collected Personal Information in the following categories from consumers within the last twelve (12) months. The categories and examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact collected but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been collected about consumers. We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information collected, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this California Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this California Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.Category of Personal InformationExamplesTypes of Sources from which this Category of Personal Information Is CollectedBusiness Purposes for CollectionTypes of Third Parties with Whom this Category of Personal Information Is Disclosed or Shared/"Sold"Unique identifiersName, signature, address, telephone email, online identifier, IP address-Directly from you-Business partners-Provide information, products, and services-Permit digital access to print subscribers.-Billing-Security, credit or fraud prevention-Provide customer service and assess satisfaction-Personalize customer experience-Improve products and services-Improve marketing and customer communications-Comply with legal requirementsDisclose:-IT providers-Payment processing providers-Hosting service providers-Email and communications providers-Accounting vendorsShare/"Sell":-Social media-Analytics providers-Vendors-Business partnersFinancial informationCredit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information-Directly from you-Business partners-Provide information, products, and services-Billing-Security, credit or fraud preventionDisclose:-IT providers-Payment processing providers-Hosting service providers-Email and communications providers-Accounting vendorsPurchase historyCommercial information, including records of, products orservices purchased, obtained, or considered,or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies-Directly from you-Business partners-Provide information, products, and services-Permit digital access to print subscribers.-Billing-Security, credit or fraud prevention-Provide customer service and assess satisfaction-Personalize customer experience-Improve products and services-Improve marketing and customer communications-Comply with legal requirementsDisclose:-IT providers-Payment processing providers-Hosting service providers-Email and communications providers-Accounting vendorsShare/"Sell":-Social media-Analytics providers-Business partnersInternet activityInternet or other electronic network activity information,including, but not limited to, browsing history,search history, and information regarding a consumer'sinteraction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement-Directly from you-Business partners-Provide customer service and assess satisfaction-Personalize customer experience-Improve products and services-Improve marketing and customer communicationsDisclose:-IT providers-Hosting service providersShare/"Sell":-Social media-Analytics providers-Vendors-Business partnersGeolocation dataGeolocation data-Directly from you-Business partners-Personalize customer experience-Improve products and services-Improve marketing and customer communications-Comply with legal requirementsDisclose:-IT providers-Hosting service providersShare/"Sell":-Social media-Analytics providers-Business partnersWe will not collect a category of Personal Information not listed above, or use any Personal Information collected in any of the above categories for a business purpose not listed above, without first providing you with notice.Personal Information of MinorsWe are proud of our online information and we strive to ensure we do not offend people of any age.
