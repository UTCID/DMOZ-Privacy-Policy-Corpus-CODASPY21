Privacy Policy
Published December 10. 2020 12:01AM
The Web sites of the Day Publishing Company (DPC), which includes The Day, theday.com, zip06.com, Times Community News Group and Shore Publishing, are covered by the policies herein.
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact The Day Publishing Company at readerrep@theday.com.
This privacy statement covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.
When does The Day Publishing Company collect my personally identifiable information?
When you register for one of The Day Publishing Company's sites, or for services on any of our sites, we collect personally identifying information from you. During registration you are asked to provide your e-mail address, location, and some demographic information including gender and date of birth. The more information you provide, the better we are able to customize our services and your experience to suit your needs and preferences. In addition to registration, we may collect personally identifiable information from you when you enter contests and sweepstakes (which may be done in conjunction with site registration), participate in promotions and special programs, register for premium or customized services, make a purchase at one of our merchants or partners, subscribe to one of our print publications, or download a software product or plug-in.
If you are making a purchase or enrolling in a premium service for which there is a fee, we, or a third party working in partnership with us, will collect your credit card, billing address, and other verifying information. In addition, we may collect personally identifiable information from you when you provide content to us for display or use on one or more of The Day Publishing Company's sites, including but not limited to, when you participate in discussions and forums, write blogs or articles, post comments, submit classified listings, post photos or videos, report a problem with one of our sites or services, or submit a letter to the editor. If you use our referral service ("AddThis") to tell a friend about an article our site, we will ask for your e-mail address and theirs. We automatically send a one-time e-mail to the address you provided. Neither your e-mail address nor the e-mail address you provide is stored or used for any other purpose.
How is my personally identifiable information used?
Our main goal is to provide you with a customized and more relevant experience on The Day Publishing Company's sites. We review our users' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns, and other information in aggregate so that we can better understand who our audience is, and what it is you want. Tracking user preferences also helps us provide more relevant advertising. Please note that we do not share your personally identifying information with the advertiser.
We use a third party to serve ads when you visit our site. This third-party ad server may use certain information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, but they are not allowed to collect or use personally identifiable information about you for their own purposes.
The DPC does not directly handle online transactions, but we work with third-party partners who do. These partners require that all credit card information be transmitted in an encrypted form, using SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, the industry-standard. These partners follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to them, both during transmission and once they receive it.
The e-mail address provided by you at registration, or as updated, may be used by The Day Publishing Company and its affiliated entities, to contact you for any reason, including: (1) Your account status (including an e-mail confirmation of registration), (2) Major changes to the Web site, the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, (3) Participation in user surveys, asking for feedback on the Web site and (4) notifying you of existing or prospective products and services offered by us or our advertisers and partners. This information helps us to improve our Web site.
To update your personal information such as name, or e-mail address, you can sign into your account and visit the My Settings page.
If you opt-in to a third-party offer on this site, then your relationship with the third party will be governed by their respective Privacy Policies. If you no longer wish to receive communication from the third party, then you will need to contact them directly to opt-out. When you use some third-party services on this site, such as coupons or to search a business, you will be taken to a co-branded site which may appear to be a DPC Web site; however, if the third party is collecting information from you, the use of this information is governed by the co-branded partner's privacy policy.

We feel strongly about protecting the privacy of children. We encourage kids to involve their parents in any interactive activity they participate in online.

DPC cannot and does not monitor or manage all User Content, and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of User Content. All User Content provided to DPC is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it. This means that you are entirely responsible for all User Content that you provide.

Transactions and E-Commerce
During your visit to DPC Web sites you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product such as a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services. Credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third-party processing agent, bank or distribution institution. While in most cases transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet or offline. If you are concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone. DPC cannot and does not take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.
Errors in Advertisements
On occasion, a product or service may not be available at the time or the price as it appears in an advertisement. In such event, or in the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error, technology effort, error in the date or length of publication, or error in pricing or product information received from our advertisers or suppliers, you agree DPC is not responsible for such errors or discrepancies.
Notice of Intellectual Property Infringement
In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable law, it is the policy of DPC, in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the registration account of a member who is deemed to infringe third-party intellectual property rights or to remove user content that is deemed to be infringing. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is displayed on DPC Web sites, please provide substantially the following information to our Copyright Agent (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these requirements):
an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
a description of your copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material you claim is infringing is located on the site (providing us with Website URL is the quickest way to help us locate content quickly);
your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
You represent, warrant and covenant (a) that no materials of any kind submitted through any current or future account(s) will (i) violate, plagiarize, or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary rights; or (ii) contain libelous or otherwise unlawful material; and (b) that you are at least 13 years old. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless The Day Publishing Company and all officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers, affiliates, licensors and licensees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liability and costs, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you or any user of your account of this Agreement or the foregoing representations, warranties and covenants. You shall cooperate as fully as required in the defense of any such claim. DPC reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.
The Day Publishing Company does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, posted or distributed through the Service by any user, information provider or any other person or entity. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such opinion, advice, statement, memorandum, or information shall be at your sole risk. THE SERVICE AND ALL DOWNLOADABLE SOFTWARE ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

FEES AND PAYMENTS
DPC reserves the right at any time to charge fees for access to portions of the Service or the Service as a whole.

Thus, if at any time DPC requires a fee for portions of the Service that are now free, DPC will give you advance notice of such fees and the opportunity to cancel the account before such charges are imposed. All new fees, if any, will be posted in appropriate locations on the Service. You shall pay all fees and charges incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred, including, but not limited to charges for any products or services offered for sale through the Service by DPC or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and charges shall be billed to and paid for by you. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to use of the Service through your account.
TERMINATION
You may terminate any of your current and/or future accounts at any time by sending e-mail to: closewebaccount@theday.com.
