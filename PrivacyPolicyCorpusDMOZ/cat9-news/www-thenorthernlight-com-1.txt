Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
By using our site, you understand and agree that the basic website technology of cookies is used. We do not track personally identifying information in cookies. We do not aggregate behavioral activity and share it with a third party.
We will not share any lists of e-mail addresses or other personal information with any third party.
In any such e-mail from us, we will provide a way for you to "opt out" or choose to decline to receive promotional e-mail from us. We may occasionally find a third-party offer in which we believe you might be interested and may send you information, but we will not provide your e-mail address to the third party.
We may also offer various surveys on the site. If the survey is a news survey or about service satisfaction, we will not share that information. Certain other surveys and contests are promotional in nature, and are often sponsored by or hosted and run by our advertisers.
In such cases, we disclose that we collect and may share the information you provide to enter the contest or complete the survey with the advertiser. Of course, you will always have the choice of whether to enter the contest or complete such a survey, and therefore you will control the decision about sharing your information.
Note to parents and children:
We fully support the intent of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which forbids the collection of personally identifiable information about children under the age of thirteen without the express written permission of their parents. We ask that children do not submit any information about themselves. Anyone using this Site or the Services warrants and promises that they are 13 years of age or older.
Some of the content on our site, including advertising, is provided directly from web servers owned and operated by third parties, and we do not control, and cannot be held responsible for, their use of any information they may collect.
We do not routinely disclose any of our individual reader information to third parties. We may disclose this information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Point Roberts Press or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so, or as otherwise provided in the Site's Terms of Use.

A last word on internet privacy:
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in the forums, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
Comment forum rules of conduct
We welcome your participation in our discussion forums –– which includes social networks. These forums offer you the chance to interact with leaders and experts in our community, along with the journalists, editors and management of Point Roberts Press, and with other users.
We ask that you post with respect for all players – people in the news, journalists, fellow forum participants, etc. This is a community. So, when you post, we encourage you to tell your fellow community members a little about who you are – not just a screen name or an E-mail address, but a bit of a bio. It enriches the discussion to know who’s “behind the post.”
In order to keep these forums enjoyable and interesting for all of our users, we ask that you follow these simple rules. By participating in the discussion forums, you are consenting to these rules. Violators may be warned, suspended from posting, or banned from the forums or chats, at the sole discretion of our staff.
Exercise common sense and be considerate toward your fellow users. Diversity of opinion and intelligent civil discourse is encouraged; by the same token, insults and “flaming” will not be tolerated. Disagreeing with an idea of another community member is different from attacking that individual.
Do not post off-topic. Please keep your comments consistent with the subject and purpose of the conversation thread. Deliberate disruption – such as consistent off-topic or frivolous commentary – will not be tolerated such posts will be deleted. Point Roberts Press and its moderators reserve the right to delete posts and/or whole conversations we determine are of an irrelevant, abusive or disruptive nature. This is your community. Let us or your fellow posters know if you feel things are getting off-topic or inappropriate.
No all-caps (FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THIS) or all-bolds please. It is extremely hard to read. Posts submitted in all-caps or all-bolds will be deleted automatically.

Also, to keep the discussion and dialogue moving, please keep posts to a reasonable length. Excessively long posts will be deleted. If you have that much to say, talk to us about a blog or a ‘reader’s perspective’ piece.
