The two co-owners of the new YogaSix studio in Creekside Park are hoping the newly opened yoga venue will provide local residents with needed relaxation, down-time and plenty of downward dog opportunities as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

Opened in August, The Woodlands location of national yoga franchise YogaSix is the first for husband and wife owners David and Melissa Reitz. It is the second outpost of the popular yoga studio in the Greater Houston area and the 42nd in the entire nation. Located inside a 1,945-square foot storefront in Creekside Park West, the newest retail shopping center developed by the Howard Hughes Corp. in Creekside Park Village Center. The studio offers a variety of classes, from strength and agility to flexibility and balance.
David Reitz said he and his wife Melissa had a goal of serving the community of Creekside Park, which is the only one of the nine villages in The Woodlands to be located in Harris County. Classes have been busy and going well, despite social distancing and mask wearing requirements outside the studio space during classes, he noted.
“It is an even better concept now than before, because people just need to relax…yoga is naturally a relaxer. Everybody is just more health conscious now. You have to find a place to relax a bit, and so yoga inherently addresses that,” he said. “We are running 33 classes per week and we’re averaging eight or nine people per class (with social distancing). It is catching on and we’re getting a lot of referrals from friends and family.”
With a motto of, “Calm Mind. Strong Vibe. Sweat Tribe,” the franchise offers fitness buffs, beginners and seasoned yoga afficianados with six different classes to fit demand and also present challenging classes for those at higher levels of pursuing their inner ‘ommm.’

Opening a new business in the middle of the worst global pandemic in 100 years hasn’t been easy, though, Reitz said. With difficulties getting the necessary county permits completed to restrictions on the number of people inside a class limited to 14, the challenge of starting the studio has been daunting, he added.
“For the most part, people are loving it. Our restore class is really popular with the highest occupancy rate. The restore is like a recovery class, a little slower, closer to the ground, opening up the muscles in the body,” he explained. “(Our) 101 (class) is really popular, it is for beginners, it is very accessible to everyone. This (class) is great for new people.(Yoga) Methodology really makes it approachable for everyone.”

Due to county restrictions on the studio in place as of Sept. 18, Reitz said the studio is limited to 14 mats or students at 6 feet spacing. There is enhanced cleaning of all touch points, guests bring their own mats and a high-tech air filter is in place that, he said, destroys most viruses and germs with ultraviolet light. Plenty of down-time is in place between classes for cleaning to be completed and a virus-free space ready for the next set of yogis.
“We have a lot of classes that are full at 14 people. If we could get the governor and (Harris) county judge to loosen things little bit, to 21 (people), that’d be good. We are doing social distancing, they are wearing masks in the lobby. It makes it hard, though, to communicate and talk about the yoga class. We do a thorough cleaning of the studio in between each class. They’ve (studio staff) really stepped up to the plate. Our air filters are cleaned by a germicidal UV light, so we are cleaning our air. At first, it was just a basic benefit (having UV filtered air). Now, it’s become one of the great things…we have good air.”
David, a former member of the Fort Bend Independent School District’s governing board, said the new studio is open seven days per week, but with less demand on weekends so there is a lesser schedule on Saturday and Sunday. Business has been more successful than expected, he noted.
“It has been amazing the way we actually opened, with everything seemingly shutting down For the people that are hurting, it has really turned the world upside down,” he added. “I’ve always had the philosophy of don’t go with the lockdown….we are going to go out and do the best we can with what we have, and this has turned out great. It is challenging, the permitting got slowed up because you have no ability talk to (inspectors). We are adapting. We have more classes, since we cannot add people to the (original schedule), we just add more classes (with less people).”
