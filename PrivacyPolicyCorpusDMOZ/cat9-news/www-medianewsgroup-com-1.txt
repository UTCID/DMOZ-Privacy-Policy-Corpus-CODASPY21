Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) granted California residents the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
If you are a California resident, to opt out of the sale of your personal information (and as a result, opt out of personalized advertising), you must utilize the Do Not Sell toggle located under Storage Preferences.
Storage Preferences can be updated by selecting the icon (shown below) on the lower right hand corner of your web browser when visiting any of our California websites.
Your opt-out preferences may be stored in cookies. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt-out preferences may not be effective. The deletion of cookies may also delete your opt-out preferences, so you should visit these pages periodically to review your preferences or to update your choices. The opt-out mechanisms are browser based and device specific; thus, you must opt-out on each device and on each browser to exercise your rights.
To unsubscribe from marketing messages from MediaNews Group, Inc. and its affiliated newspapers, you can adjust your preferences under the ‘MyAccount’ account settings or select unsubscribe at the base of the received communication.
California residents can learn more about the additional rights granted to them by the CCPA here and they may submit requests by completing the California consumer request form found here.
