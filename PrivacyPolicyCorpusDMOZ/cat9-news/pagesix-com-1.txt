She’s still a “Real Housewife” after all.
Over a year after Page Six exclusively reported that Bethenny Frankel was still legally married to Jason Hoppy, it appears that nothing has changed for the former “RHONY” star.
Frankel, 49, revealed during “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” Thursday that she could not marry her boyfriend, Paul Bernon, because she was still someone’s wife.
“I’m still married,” the Skinnygirl mogul admitted to a shocked Cohen. “Crickets again. And scene! And we’re back!”
Frankel and Hoppy, 49, married in 2010 ahead of their daughter Bryn’s birth on her own spin-off, “Bethenny Ever After.” She filed for divorce in 2013, but the couple has been battling it out in court ever since.
“Jason and Bethenny are still technically married,” Hoppy’s matrimonial attorney Robert Wallack told The Post in August 2019. “While Jason has been pushing for years to have the judge sign the divorce judgment, Bethenny’s lawyers have objected.”
Frankel also filed an order of protection against Hoppy in 2017. He was charged with harassing her after an incident at their daughter’s school.
Frankel began dating Bernon in 2018 following the death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Dennis Shields.
