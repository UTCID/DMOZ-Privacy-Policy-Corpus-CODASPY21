Partly to make up for lost time and a postponed spring edition, New Haven Restaurant Week will expand to two weeks this fall for an extended run on prix fixe menus at 25 restaurants in the food-loving city.
From Sunday, Sept. 13, through Sept. 26, the promotion will have its first edition during a pandemic, and capacity restrictions inside and outside will make reservations even more important to your plans.
Fourteen of the eateries will take part in the two-course lunch version, which is $19 and all restaurants will offer the three-course dinner at $36. An intriguing new wrinkle by 21 of the restaurants is a takeout option, with to-go dinners for four priced at $60, but you should call the day before to arrange that deal.
All pricing is per person and excludes beverage, tax and gratuity, notes organizer Market New Haven Inc. Customers are encouraged to check with participating restaurants for operating protocols, but do plan on wearing a mask when entering or exiting and keeping distance from other folks.
There are some discounted parking lots for the promotion or you can just park at metered spots on the streets.
