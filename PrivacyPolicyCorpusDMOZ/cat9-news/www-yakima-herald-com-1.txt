When you use these third-party services offered on our sites, personally identifiable information you provide may be collected directly by these third parties solely in order to deliver the services you have requested. These third-party partners may not use or distribute our users' information in any capacity outside of the service for which we contracted and they must comply with our privacy policies.Transactional partners: In some cases we partner with another company to co-promote their services within our websites. In these cases, you are transacting directly with the other party, and the personally identifiable information you enter on those services is shared both with that transactional partner and the Yakima Herald-Republic. On those pages requiring personally identifiable information, the transactional partner's brand is clearly visible, and their privacy statement is posted. We encourage you to read it.How do we use site usage statistics?The Yakima Herald-Republic collects some information automatically via server logs and cookies.
