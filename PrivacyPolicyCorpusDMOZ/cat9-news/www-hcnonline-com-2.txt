As social distancing measure continue, The Lake Houston Wilderness Park provides an outdoor option for residents looking for an outlet.
The park is open daily for hiking, biking, canoeing, horseback riding and getting back outside in many ways on nearly 5,000 acres at 25840 FM 1485, New Caney.
WHAT TO DO: These 19 Houston attractions survived coronavirus and are reopening
The park is open with limitations — they will be open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday and Saturday with an entrance fee of $3 for people between the ages of 13 to 64 with free entry for military and seniors. The Lake Houston Wilderness Park is closed on Tuesday. Park officials will not offer rentals or open park facilities except for restrooms, which are cleaned three times a day. Areas that are not in use are being sanitized once a week as a precaution. Overnight camping is not available at this time.
The park only closed due to the coronavirus during Easter weekend when Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner closed all city parks. It was the first time a mayor closed Lake Houston Wilderness Park in at least 15 years, said Lauren Hollenbeck, a park naturalist at Lake Houston Wilderness Park.
Hollenbeck said with the size of the park, it is easy to continue to socially distance while getting outside. Trails, for the most part, are not challenging and the Peach Creek Overlook is Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA accessible.
“The great thing about Lake Houston Wilderness Park is that it is decently sized — it’s almost 5,000 acres,” Hollenbeck said. “We have over 20 miles of trails so if you come up here it’s great to pack a lunch and plan to take a long hike because you can walk on a trail for a couple of hours and only run into a few other people, and it’s really easy to social distance that way.”
Peach Creek Overlook is often a popular location in the park for swimming and fishing. Hollenbeck recommends if visitors plan to stop at this area in the park, to spread out and come with immediate family.
“We do suggest that if you’re going to do that then you need to come with your immediate family and you spread out,” Hollenbeck said. “It is kind of a small beach, so we’ve been kind of making sure that not too many people are there and not too many large groups are there.”
HOUSING AND CORONAVIRUS: Houston-area evictions set to pick up in June
Hollenbeck believes that getting outside is important and a good way to get to feeling better mentally and physically during the closures, changes and “new normals.” She recommends researching before visiting to the park, bring hand sanitizer, wear a mask if coming into contact with people and to practice safe social distancing. The park’s website also urges visitors that if anyone has been sick in the last two weeks to stay home.
“I think that getting outside right now is really important and getting into nature is really important because sitting inside your house can be kind of mentally hard. When you’re not sure with the COVID stuff, it can kind of get difficult,” Hollenbeck said. “So getting out here and reconnecting with nature can make you feel better mentally and I think it makes you feel better, you get exercise, you get your heart pumping, which is awesome. It’s kind of a nice little escape.”
