Letters to the Editor
The Daily News welcomes letters of up to 200 words on any public issue. Any letter that exceeds the word limit will not be considered for publication.
We publish only original letters addressed to The Daily News. An address and daytime phone number must be included so the author's identity can be verified. No letters will be published until authorship is confirmed.
All letters and guest columns are subject to editing. The Daily News reserves the right to decline publication of any submission.

Permission to Reprint
Material published in The Daily News newspaper and on the newspaper's sites, including articles, photos, graphics and other content, is copyrighted by The Daily News and by other information providers who have licensed their content to The Daily News. You may not reproduce, republish or redistribute this material without the written permission of The Daily News.

Corrections
The Daily News makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information we report, and it is our policy to correct errors promptly. Readers can bring mistakes to our attention by telephone at 409-683-5200 or 800-561-3611 or by email.

Removing Content
The Daily News does not remove articles from its site or archives as a matter of policy.
Content published online is part of the public record, just the same as are printed newspapers preserved in attics, on microfiche in libraries or in digital archives. Archived articles may be corrected or amended as needed, but not removed. If you want to request an update or correction to a story, please contact our news staff.
Caching technology used by search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing and other sites will archive our stories as soon as they're published. Removing an article from the newspaper's archive won't remove all traces of that article's existence, which is another reason we try to correct or update stories rather than removing them.
Privacy
The Daily News is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using our site and related online services.
We may make content or services from other sites partnered with The Daily News available to you from links located within The Daily News site. These other sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such site to determine how that site protects your privacy.
See Our Privacy Policy
Discussion Guidelines
The Daily News considers the discussion of issues important to the general public. Use of the blogs, forums or live discussions for personal attacks will not be tolerated. Any such dialogue will be subject to removal from the site.
We reserve the right to restrict any communication which we deem to be harmful to individual members, damaging to the site's discussions, or in violation of the newspaper's rights or any third-party rights. Comments are posted in public areas that we cannot screen in advance.
