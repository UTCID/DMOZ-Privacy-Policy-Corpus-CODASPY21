We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for responding to requests that are not labeled or not sent properly, or do not have complete information. Your request to opt-out of our future sharing of your Personal Information with either Southern Community Newspapers Inc. Affiliates or third parties will be processed within ten (10) business days of the date it is received in accordance with the information below. Please note that non-affiliated third parties are independent from Southern Community Newspapers Inc. and if you wish to stop all communications from such third parties, you will need to address your request to the non-affiliated third parties directly.Collection of Personal Information You do not need to provide any Personal Information (which is information that can identify you or can be used to contact you) to use a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel or to obtain information from most of the features and activities of a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel. In general, you can visit our web channels without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information. However, if you want to participate in certain online services, you may be asked to provide some Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, business address, telephone, mobile phone, birth date or age, and/or e-mail address. You might be asked to choose a user name and password, and provide that information when accessing certain online features or services. If you do not want to give us any Personal Information, you can always choose not to participate. The choice is yours. We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs. Unless stated otherwise, we do not purposefully request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as ".net" or ".com") as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law. However, when "computer to phone" commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain features or services. We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information. All users of the Service are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false or fraudulent. Any prize or benefit shall be forfeited due to a rejected or disqualified entry. Your continued participation indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below. We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from Advertisers, or marketing companies. This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Service or a participant in Newspaper activities. The list below contains some of the instances when a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel, one of its operational service providers or vendors (third party companies that provide internal support to the Service) may collect your Personal Information. Please note that many of our web channels may offer additional online features and services and may ask you to provide some Personal Information before permitting you to access those areas.To fill out a data information or deletion request, click here. (California residents ONLY)Automated News Services and Updates.

Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's Personal Information, and will include an opportunity for parents to prevent use of their children's Personal Information, as well as to prevent their children from participating in features which involve the collection of Personal Information. In addition, if/when we request Personal Information from children less than 13 years of age with verifiable parental consent, we will not require the child to disclose more Personal Information than is necessary in order to participate in any online feature or service.Should a child whom we know to be under 13 submit Personal Information to a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will immediately reject any such entry and delete that information from our database, unless such information meets an exception under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act or pertains to the programming or operations of Southern Community Newspapers Inc.

When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred from a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel and connected to the service or website of the third party organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between Southern Community Newspapers Inc. and a third party Linked Website, you understand, acknowledge and agree that Southern Community Newspapers Inc. exercises no control and has no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or business practices of a Linked Website. Each of these Linked Websites (such as Second Street Media's contest "U-PickEm,” and photo gallery "My Capture") maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. web channel, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing those websites with any of your Personal Information.Framed Websites/Pages The Service may also include certain pages that are "framed" and link to third party websites ("Framed Pages"). We provide these Framed Pages as a convenience to our users. A Framed Page may have the same look and feel as other pages on the Service, with a Southern Community Newspapers Inc. or Newspaper logo and border, but Framed Pages are often merely gateways to other websites. Even if an affiliation exists between Southern Community Newspapers Inc. and a Framed Page, you understand, acknowledge and agree that Southern Community Newspapers Inc. exercises no control over Framed Pages, and Southern Community Newspapers Inc. is not responsible for any content or the privacy policies or data-collection practices of a Framed Page.
