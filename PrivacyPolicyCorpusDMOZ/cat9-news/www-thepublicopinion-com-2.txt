We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.Information CollectedThe newspaper limits its collection of information from children to what is known as nonpersonally identifiable information (e.g. screen names, birthday, gender, city, state, zip code and country of residence). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities. The newspaper cannot and does not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Information is collected actively, such as through registration forms, and passively, such as through cookies.Contest and SweepstakesThe newspaper occasionally offers contest and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. Children under 13 may not participate in any online contest offered by The Public Opinion.Use of InformationThe newspaper may disclose information maintained as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
