The evaluation is metrics driven. We measure respondents’ answers based on their assessment against other organizations with similar workforces.

This applies to all companies and organizations.EEO-1 InformationWe give extra credit to companies that either send us a link to a public disclosure of their EEO-1 numbers or send us the information separately.
