Advocacy
When courts, government offices, or other organizations consider cases or policy decisions that affect consumers or competition, the FTC may offer insight through amicus briefs or advocacy letters. In these matters, the FTC provides its expertise and advocates for policies that protect consumers and promote competition.
In addition, companies, industry groups, consumer organizations, and others petition the FTC to approve merger remedies, and to revise rule-makings, initiate investigations, or take other action.
The Office of Policy Planning helps to guide the agency’s advocacy and policy work and the Office of General Counsel’s amicus briefs provide the courts with the agency’s perspective on various issues.
