Areas of extreme drought conditions are expanding in Connecticut, according to a new report released Thursday. U.S. Drought Monitor says that 99 percent of the state has abnormally dry or drought conditions; last week it nearly 85 percent.
Areas of extreme drought conditions are expanding across Connecticut, according to a new report released Thursday.
U.S. Drought Monitor says 99 percent of the state has abnormally dry or drought conditions. Last week, it nearly 83 percent.
Extreme drought conditions now cover about 15 percent of Connecticut in northern Hartford and Tolland counties and the eastern half of Windham County and parts of New London County; last week it was 2 percent.
The worsening drought conditions have led some water companies this week to request or order water conservation.
Effects of extreme drought conditions include stressed Christmas tree farms, dairy farmers struggling financially, well drillers and bulk water haulers seeing increased business, rivers and streams running low, warmer water temperatures, wells running dry and people digging more and deeper wells.
Conditions are worse in neighboring Rhode Island where 94 percent of the Ocean State has extreme drought conditions.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture rated 100 percent of Rhode Island’s pastures in very poor to poor condition. Pastures were rated 90 percent very poor to poor in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
“Streamflow in many areas of the Northeast is very low for this time of year. Some of the areas hardest hit by drought are reporting wells going dry and new wells needing to be dug,” Drought Monitor’s report said.
The latest report shows severe drought conditions in 37 percent of the state in northeastern Litchfield County, most of Hartford County, part of Tolland County, southwestern Tolland County and part of eastern New London County.
There are moderate drought conditions in central Litchfield County, northeastern New Haven County, nearly all of Middlesex County, southeastern Hartford County, southern Tolland County and the western half of New London County, according to the report.

Abnormally dry conditions have returned to all of Fairfield County. Last week, there were none. The eastern half of both New Haven and Litchfield counties remained unchanged from last week’s abnormally dry conditions classification, the report said.
On Tuesday, Clinton-based Connecticut Water asked customers served by its Shoreline system to voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 10 percent because of continued dry weather and increased use, company officials said.
The towns served by the Shoreline system are Clinton, Guilford, Madison, Old Saybrook and Westbrook. The drought advisory announced by the utility for customers in those communities is the first of four stages of Connecticut Water’s drought response plan designed to extend available water supplies to meet essential needs.
Craig Patla, vice president of service delivery at Connecticut Water, said between June and August, water use was about 20 percent higher than it was in the summer of 2019.
This week, the Bristol Water and Sewer Department announced the city’s reservoirs have declined to below 60 percent capacity from the lack of rain. The city is now requiring all customers to limit the amount of outside water use and requiring the public to adhere to the department’s policy on odd/even watering days.
On Wednesday, the Putnam Sewer and Water Department asked customers to voluntarily limit their water usage.
