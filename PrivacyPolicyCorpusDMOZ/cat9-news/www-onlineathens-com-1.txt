Georgia joins $60 million legal settlement with C.R. BardDave WilliamsCapitol Beat News ServiceATLANTA — Georgia has joined a 48-state legal settlement requiring C.R. Bard Inc. and its parent company to pay $60 million for the deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical mesh devices.Thousands of women implanted with surgical mesh have made claims that they suffered serious complications resulting from the devices, including erosion of mesh through organs, pain during intercourse, and voiding dysfunction.“Failing to adequately inform patients and health-care providers of the serious risks associated with these devices put the welfare of countless women in jeopardy,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said. “This settlement sends a strong message that these practices are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”The lawsuit filed by the state alleged that C.R. Bard and parent company Becton, Dickinson and Company misrepresented or failed to adequately disclose serious and life-altering risks of surgical mesh devices, including chronic pain, scarring and shrinking of bodily tissue, recurring infections and other complications.Although C.R. Bard has stopped selling transvaginal mesh, the settlement requires the company to adhere to certain terms if they reenter the transvaginal mesh market.The company must provide patients with understandable descriptions of complications in marketing materials; train independent contractors, agents, and employees who sell, market, or promote mesh regarding their obligations to report all patient complaints and adverse events to the company; and make sure its practices regarding the reporting of patient complaints are consistent with federal requirements.
