This accelerated dual-degree program allows students to complete Master of Mass Communication and Master of Legal Studies degrees in two years. A collaboration between the Cronkite School and ASU’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, this program provides opportunities for students who want to ground their journalism in a deep understanding of the law and legal issues and for students who want to apply a legal foundation to careers in media management, entrepreneurship, emerging technology or strategic communications.
Classes and Professional Programs
The standalone MMC requires 36 hours of coursework, and the standalone MLS requires 30 hours of coursework. In the dual-degree program, both schools accept up to six credits of coursework from the other partner, allowing students to complete both degrees with 54 credits of coursework.
Cronkite School
Graduate students begin with the foundational Master of Mass Communication “boot camp” experience, which prepares students to write and produce content for print, digital, radio and television platforms. Next, they take advanced-level classes in media research, business and economic reporting and 21st century media organizations and entrepreneurship. Students complete their Cronkite experience with a capstone experience in one of the Cronkite School’s professional immersion programs in Phoenix, Los Angeles or Washington, D.C.
Up to 6 credits of MLS coursework will be accepted toward this degree.

Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law

Students then complete their remaining 22-24 hours of legal coursework by choosing electives that align with their interests and career objectives.
