NEWSROOM
The Landmark only publishes items directly related to the five Wachusett towns, Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland and Sterling. Items not appropriate for publication will not be returned.
ARREST LOG
As part of its police and fire coverage, The Landmark prints a full record of all local police arrests in the five Wachusett towns, Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland and Sterling. All charges listed in the police log are printed for each arrest. Names are printed for all suspects aged 17 and up. In the interest of fairness to all those who are arrested, positively no exceptions are made to this policy.
The Landmark will gladly print the disposition of court cases arising from local arrests, upon receipt of documentary proof that the case was dismissed or the individual was acquitted. This notice will be printed on the same page as the police log in print, and will be added to the police log online beside the original report of the arrest. Contact the editor to inquire about printing a disposition.
CORRECTIONS
News: The Landmark is committed to accuracy in its news reports. If you believe you have found an error, please contact the editor at 508-767-9555, ext. 4555, or kpayson@gatehousemedia.com. Confirmed fact errors online will be corrected online; errors in print will be corrected in a notice printed in the appropriate section of the newspaper. The Landmark will only print corrections of statements that are proven to be factually incorrect; readers are invited to write a letter to the editor or Speak Out to add their comments to our coverage.
Advertising: The liability of the publisher on account of errors or omissions from any advertisement will in no way exceed the amount of the charge for the space occupied by the item in error, and then only for the first incorrect insertion. The publisher has the right to refuse any advertisement.
OBITUARIES
The Landmark provides two options for obituaries. A listing in our Passings section, including the name, age, date of death and basic funeral information, will be published free for residents who live in the Landmark coverage towns of Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland and Sterling.
A paid obituary is open to everyone and allows families to provide the information of their choosing. Photos may be included. Veterans receive a complimentary American flag graphic. These obituaries should be submitted through a funeral home.
OPINIONS
The Landmark welcomes reader comments for print on its Editorials & Opinions pages. Letters to the editor should be under 300 words, unless it is a candidate endorsement (see below for details); they must be signed and include an address and phone number for verification. The writer’s name and hometown will be printed. Anonymous letters and letters by writers living outside the five-town Wachusett district, addressing state, national or global issues, will not be printed and will not be returned. Writers are limited to one letter every six weeks.
ELECTIONS
Residents may submit letters of endorsement, which will run on the Letters to the Editor page as space allows. Endorsements are limited to 150 words. The editor reserves the right to edit for length and clarity. The Landmark will not print candidate endorsements or letters relating to an election the last week before Election Day. This ensures fairness to the candidates and their supporters, who would not have a chance to respond in print before the vote.
The deadline for letters is noon, Friday (an earlier deadline of 5 p.m. the previous Thursday applies on holiday weeks). Opinion contributions may be sent to kpayson@gatehousemedia.com; by mail to 100 Front St., 5th Floor, Worcester MA 01615-0012; or dropped off 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, at 100 Front St., 5th Floor, Worcester.
SOCIAL NEWS
News of local births, milestone birthdays, anniversaries, engagements, weddings, certifications, graduations, promotions and honors is printed for free, as space is available, in The Landmark. Social news items may be sent to kpayson@gatehousemedia.com; by mail to 100 Front St., 5th Floor, Worcester MA 01615-0012; or dropped off 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, at 100 Front St., 5th Floor, Worcester.
