INDIVIDUAL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL THE BEFRUGAL ADD-ON.
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT") CONTAINS THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND CAPITAL INTELLECT, INC. ("CAPITAL INTELLECT") WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN.
BY DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, INSTALLING OR USING THE BEFRUGAL ADD-ON (THE "SOFTWARE"), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE BEFRUGAL ADD-ON. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY (SEE SECTIONS 6 AND 7) AND AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY (SEE SECTIONS 6 AND 7). THESE PROVISIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF OUR AGREEMENT.
BeFrugal Add-On Usage and Functionality
The BeFrugal Add-On may show cash back, coupons, and deals available at a merchant website. If you click on such offers, you may be shown the appropriate BeFrugal website page with further information on the cash back, coupons or deals. You may then click on cash back, coupons or deals to earn the cash back or discount for purchases made during that browsing session. Any cash back earned will be subject to the Terms of Service of BeFrugal and corresponding merchant affiliate programs.
The BeFrugal Add-On may cause an information bar to appear when you visit a merchant website, and may notify you that the merchant website has cash back, coupons, or deals available via the BeFrugal Add-On. If you click on the information bar, you may be taken to the merchant website. If the information bar appears, you need to click on the information bar to get the cash back indicated. Any cash back earned will be subject to the Terms of Service of BeFrugal and corresponding merchant affiliate programs. Additionally, when you visit a merchant website, the BeFrugal Add-On may offer a dropdown list of coupon or promo codes as suggestions.
If you are a BeFrugal member, when you visit certain participating merchant website(s), such as by typing in the URL or by clicking on a link (including those on a search engine results page), the BeFrugal Add-On may redirect you through an affiliate network site to the merchant website, and a tracking cookie may be placed in your browser. This cookie is used to track any transaction or purchase through the merchant website and appropriately credit your BeFrugal account with cash back.
As part of the download and installation process for the BeFrugal Add-On, you may be provided with options to reset your homepage, your default search, and your new tab page. The BeFrugal Add-On may reset your homepage, and/or reset your default search, and/or reset your new tab page to Yahoo!.

We do not share or sell any of this data with any third parties, unless compelled by applicable law, or regulation.
