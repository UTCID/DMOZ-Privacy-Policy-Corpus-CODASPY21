We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any Products you may obtain from or through other websites or web pages, even if you were directed or linked to such a website or page through this Service. For Products listed advertised on our classified advertising features, please see “Classifieds: Products Advertised by Users,” Section 9 below.If a Product offered directly by SCNI is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel orders placed for that Product, whether or not the order has been confirmed and even if your credit or debt card account has been charged (in which event we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge).Our creation or transmission of an order confirmation does not signify final acceptance of your order, nor constitute a binding confirmation of an offer to sell any Product and we reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason up until the time the Product is actually delivered to you. We reserve the right at any time, without prior notice, to limit or reduce the quantity you ordered of any Product and we will notify you if we do so.

No Professional Advice: Any information supplied by any employee or agent of SCNI, whether by telephone, e-mail, letter, facsimile or other form of communication, is intended solely as general guidance on the use of the Service, and does not constitute legal, tax, accounting or other professional advice.
