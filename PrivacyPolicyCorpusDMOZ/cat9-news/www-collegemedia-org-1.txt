Personally identifiable information may be given to a third party in order to complete a specific business transaction on behalf of CMA. Contact information from inquiries received by CMA may be shared with CMA members to provide a service, satisfy a question, or develop a prospective business relationship.We may disclose personally identifiable information to the proper authorities if we become subject to a subpoena or court order, or if we are otherwise legally required to disclose such information. We also may use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person. If all or part of CMA is merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, we may transfer the personally identifiable information you provided to us to such entity as part of that transaction.Registration and Order FormsIn order to enroll or register in a program; attend CMA events, meetings, or conferences; or request products or services; you may be required to fill out a registration or order form and provide personally identifiable information which we will use to process your registration or order. In certain circumstances, a program accessed through the Site may be jointly sponsored or co-sponsored with other organizations and registration may or may not be handled by CMA.

Please note that CMA is not responsible for the privacy policies of these other organizations (or their use of your personally identifiable or other information) and hereby disclaims any liability or responsibility in connection therewith. In addition, your name and information may appear on registration or attendee lists distributed at CMA events, meetings and conferences to other attendees and third parties.
