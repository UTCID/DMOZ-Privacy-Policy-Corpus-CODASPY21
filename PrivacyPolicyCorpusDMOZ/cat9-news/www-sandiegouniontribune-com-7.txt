NEW YORK —
The lawyer representing a man accused of conspiring with associates of Rudy Giuliani to make illegal campaign contributions has asked a judge to let him quit the case, in part because his client hasn’t paid his legal bills.David Correia is among four men charged last year with using straw donors to make illegal contributions to politicians they thought could help their political and business interests. He also faces a fraud charge.Two other men charged in the case, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, worked with Giuliani to try and get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Democrat Joe Biden.In a letter to a federal court judge in Manhattan that was made public Friday, Correia’s attorney, William Harrington, didn’t detail all the reasons he was asking for permission to leave the case. But he referenced a finding by a judge that Correia “has not paid his legal bills.”

A message was left with Harrington on Friday seeking comment.Prosecutors said Correia, an American-born businessman who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, Florida, teamed with Parnas, Fruman and a third man, Andrey Kukushkin, in a scheme to make illegal campaign donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states in an attempt to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.Parnas and Fruman face separate charges that they made illegal campaign contributions to Republicans, in part to further the political interests of a Ukrainian government official.All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.

Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer and a former New York City mayor, has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn’t seen any evidence that Parnas or Fruman did anything wrong.
