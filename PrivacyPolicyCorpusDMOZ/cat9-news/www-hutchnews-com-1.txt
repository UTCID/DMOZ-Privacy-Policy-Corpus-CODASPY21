Haven’s second annual Farm Safety Day educated pre-K through fourth-graders in how to stay safe around animals and farm equipment.More than 30 Haven High School students taught nearly 250 elementary school students from Haven Grade School about farm safety. Michele Pitts from the Reno County Farm Bureau also helped with the event."Our community has been hit hard by farm safety issues," said Laurel Scott, principal of Haven Grade School. "It only takes a split second to impact a life."The high school students brought miniature horses, goats and donkeys. Along with a 2-year old ram, there were a calf, a pig, a few chickens and a couple of tractors at the 10 stations on the elementary school’s lawn. The students traveled in groups of 10 and visited each of the stations."My favorite was feeding the pig," said Emma Cooprider, 7. "I fed him marshmallows."Neither Emma nor her classmate Lamonte Braxton, 7, also in first grade, lives on a farm. But both were excited to visit with animals and learn about tractors."I am excited to see the tractors and the animals," said Lamonte. "I see lots of new stuff."Each student was told by a high school student how to respect both animals and machinery. Sophomores Brie Brawner and Macy Bowese showed the children Oreo and Flynn, two Pygmy goats owned by high school senior Hunter Galloway."A goat could charge like any other animal," Brie Brawner, 15, told a group of first-graders. "You want to move slowly around an animal."Even the farmers’ and ranchers’ children were happy to be around the animals."Sometimes a parent can tell them something over and over and they tune them out," Scott said. "Someone (a high school student) teaching them in a different way helps."The teachers enjoy having their students learn about safety. Fourteen-year veteran kindergarten teacher Cori Krol said her kids love the event. When they go back to the classroom they continue talking about farm safety and the animals."The kids love it," Krol said. "It’s a way for kids to get awareness."All the high school students are in FFA, and many bring their own animals to the event."It’s a really good way to get them to understand about the farm," said Grace Sawatzky, vice president of Haven High School’s FFA. "It teaches them to be safe on the farm."Kendall Schoenhals, the president of Haven’s FFA, told the children where to stand around a horse so they would not get hurt. She also explained the type of shoe that should be worn when visiting with farm animals. The children were then able to pet Kendall’s cousin’s miniature horse, Snowball.Although the event was student-led, Baylee Knapp, the agriculture teacher for Haven High School, helped guide the event."We were able to fit everything we needed here," Knapp said. "This is a super-important event, and we didn’t want COVID to stop us."
