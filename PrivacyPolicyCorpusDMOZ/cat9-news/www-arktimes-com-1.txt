Privacy Policy
The Arkansas Times collects user information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics such as domain names and/or IP addresses. This information is used only in the aggregate, primarily to discover which features users are reading the most, what features they like best and what we can do to make things better. We may also share aggregate data with our advertisers.
Personal information
When you register on this website or use services on the site, we collect some personal information directly from you, typically just your e-mail address and zip code. If you register for a give-away or participate in a survey, we may also ask for your physical address, phone number, date of birth and/or gender. Such information is only gathered with users’ consent. We won’t provide your personal information to any third parties without your consent unless we are required to do so by law, court order or subpoena, or we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of another person.

These companies often use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information.
