Aggregated Data will not contain information from which you may be personally identified.
Personalization
We process certain Personal Data as necessary in connection with our legitimate business interest in personalizing our Digital Services. For example, aspects of the Digital Services may be customized to you, to display content that you have interacted with in the past, or to display content that we think may be of interest to you based on your interactions with our Digital Services and other content.

How We Process Personal Data for Commercial Purposes
We and certain third parties process Personal Data we hold for certain purposes, depending on the context of collection and your rights and choices, including:Personalization & Consumer Profiles
In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend content and Services that are personalized to our customers, we may create a “Consumer Profile” by linking together and analyzing Personal Data collected in the following contexts:
When you make a purchase or other transaction through our Services
When you access or use our Digital Services
Cookies and other tracking technologies
When you enter a contest or other promotion
When you contact us or submit information to us
Feedback and Surveys
We may also augment Consumer Profiles with Personal Data that we create (such as Inference Data) or that we receive from our affiliated companies or third parties, and may include Personal Data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, and demographic data.
We use Consumer Profiles for our legitimate interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of people who have subscribed to our Publications in the past, and compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in the database who have similar Personal Data to the subscribers, we may then target marketing to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically. We may also use this information for other Commercial Purposes.
Marketing Communications
Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our third-party partners) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with or submission of User Content to us. These communications may be personalized or customized based on your user profile.
Similarly, we may also collect Device/Network Data and Contact Data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate Inference Data based on these interactions.
We may also process this Personal Data for targeted advertising. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising with appropriate consent.
Targeted Advertising
We, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from personalization and profiling. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Inference Data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.
We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).
Data Sales
Certain Commercial Processing purposes involve “sales” of data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” (as defined by applicable law) certain Personal Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors, when we conduct targeted advertising, or we may sell or grant access to Personal Data to our marketing partners, promoters, and other advertisers. See the California Rights & Disclosures section for a list of categories of Personal Data sold.

Marketers:
In order to improve personalization, deliver more relevant information and advertisements to you, and develop better products and services, we may share certain Personal Data with our affiliates and trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other Commercial Purposes, and we may allow our affiliates and other third parties (such as Facebook, ad exchanges, data management platforms, or ad servers) to operate on our Digital Services and process data for behavioral advertising.
Social Media:

We may share, rebroadcast, or redisplay Personal Data or other information in the post to the extent permitted by the relevant social media service and otherwise use the data for our Commercial Purposes. In addition, in order to improve personalization, deliver more relevant advertisements, and develop better products and services, we may share certain Personal Data with current or future affiliated entities and trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may allow third parties (such as Facebook and social media advertisers, ad exchanges, data management platforms, or ad servers) to operate on our Services and process data for targeted advertising.

We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Data to such parties.
International:
We operate in and use service providers located in the United States. If you are located outside the U.S., your Personal Data will be transferred to the U.S. by necessity in order to deliver the Services to you.

However, we sometimes share Personal Data with third parties as noted above, and we do not have control over third parties’ security processes.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access one of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
