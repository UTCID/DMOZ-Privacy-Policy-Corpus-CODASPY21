Any claim or dispute between you and Paxton Media that arises in whole or in part from the Site shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Tennessee, provided, that you hereby agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Site requires that such claim be resolved exclusively by confidential binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate intellectual property rights, Paxton Media may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Paxton Media's failure to act with respect to a breach by any visitor using the Site does not constitute a waiver of its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
