EDUCATIONFamilies to sue Lee County school district over face mask policyPamela McCabeFort Myers News-PressView Comments Four local families have banded together to sue the Lee County school district over its requirement for students to wear face masks while at school.The lawsuit says the policy violates Florida's Constitution on several counts. This includes stepping on the rights of parents to make decisions for their children and their health, as well as forcing those who cannot wear masks into virtual learning, which is “separate and unequal" to the learning that happens in brick-and-mortar classrooms. The 51-page document was filed in the Lee County courthouse Friday.“Due to pending litigation, it is inappropriate for us to comment at this time,” said Rob Spicker, a spokesperson for the school district.More:Mother, 2-year-old escorted from Southwest Airlines flight because of mask policyTampa-based attorney Patrick Leduc is representing the local families.“This lawsuit, in a nutshell, is about empowering parents to make decisions in the best interests of their children,” Leduc said. “Every time the government comes up to you and says, ‘You need to do X because we’re trying to protect you,’ invariably that means you are going to lose rights.”Leduc believes the district could sidestep legal action by revising the policy from a mask requirement to a recommendation, allowing students who don’t want to or cannot wear masks to still attend brick-and-mortar schools. They could be temperature checked at the door, instead, and focus more on physical distancing, he said.“I think the school board could make one change and it would make the whole thing go away — and that is to say that the parent has the ability to make the decision,” he said.Leduc is also representing families in similar suits in Hillsborough and Brevard counties.“For many reasons, Constitutionally, these polices are problematic,” he said. “A lack of a limiting principle, the fact that you’re compelling children who cannot wear a mask to a system of education that is inherently separate and unequal, and you are violating the parental rights of parents who know their children better than the school board does. And I would argue that the parents love their children more than the school board does.”More:First Lee schools classroom quarantined for COVID-19Across Southwest Florida, school districts made facial coverings part of re-opening plans to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The guidelines were made after consulting with local medical experts.“If you look at the announcements and the materials that are on our webpage, it is there because of the advisements,” Spicker, a school spokesperson, said. “And when the advisements change, the policy will change.”Initial conversations this summer about the re-opening of public schools focused on physical distancing, temperature checks for students and face masks being worn at high-risk times, such as crowded school buses and hallways.#AdynStrong: Cape Coral siblings collect toys for hospitals

Southwest Florida schools differ on procedure, disciplineAlthough most students who refuse masks would be routed to a form of virtual learning, there are exceptions to the mask mandate.Lee schools does not require children under the age of 2 or any person who has “trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or is not able to safely remove the face covering on their own” to wear masks.Also, students with disabilities or medical reasons that make wearing masks all day difficult are asked to contact their school administration to provide documentation. The district has said that accommodations may be arranged if staff determine it is a reasonable request.View Comments
