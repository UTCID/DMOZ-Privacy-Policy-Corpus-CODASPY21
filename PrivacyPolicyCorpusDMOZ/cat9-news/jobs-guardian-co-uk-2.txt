To provide the services you sign up for, for example, setting up your Job Alerts, Job Match Emails or your Guardian Jobs profile and related internal administrative purposes (such as those we need for our accounting and records) and to make you aware of any changes to our services.
To provide your job application to the company that advertised the position or the recruitment company.
So that you can add your CV to the searchable CV database.

Legal grounds for using your personal data
We will only use your personal data where we have a legal ground to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal data. In every case, the legal ground will be one of the following:
Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent that your CV can be viewed by recruiters when you have added it to your database. You can withdraw your consent at any time in your Jobs account, by choosing “Who can view your profile” in the section “edit your profile”.
Our legitimate interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand how our services are used, promote our services and operate the Jobs website and app efficiently for the provision of our services. For example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we carry out marketing analysis to understand our customers to determine what marketing communications may be relevant to them. It is also in our legitimate interest to analyse what content has been viewed on the Jobs website and app, so that we can understand how they are used.
Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you: For example, where you have signed up for a Guardian Jobs account, we will need to collect your account details and profile information.
Compliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.
Using children’s personal data
We do not aim any of our services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13. Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.
Security of your personal data
We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of the Jobs website or app. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.
Never disclose any private information in response to a job advertisement or include on your CV any of the following: National Insurance number, driving licence number, passport number, bank/credit card details and date of birth. If you are ever asked to do this by a recruiter please contact us. For more information about secure job searching click here.
Who we share your personal data with
One-off job applications
When you apply for jobs on the Jobs website and upload your CV, a copy is stored on the CV database. This database can only be searched by recruiters if you allow this in your settings. To control whether recruiters (or what particular recruiters) can see your CV on the database, you need to create a Jobs website profile and click on the settings that apply.
If you choose to share your CV or personal details with recruiters, we ask them not to hold your CV for longer than is necessary and not to use your CV for purposes other than recruitment.
CV database
When you submit a one-off application through the Jobs website, we share it directly with the company who advertised the position. We will keep a copy of your CV for six months. However, sometimes you can also submit your CV directly to the company. In this case we do not receive a copy of your CV. When applying without a Jobs website profile, you have the option to store a copy of your CV on the main CV database. Recruiters can search the main CV database depending on your settings as explained above.
We do not share your personal data with other people or companies that are not directly linked to us except under the following circumstances:
We use other service providers who provide services on our behalf such as managing the platform.
We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority or other organisation if we believe we need to do so to keep to a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else.
We may reveal your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.
Any other organisations that access your personal data in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure they protect your personal data and keep to all data privacy laws that apply. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.
We will not share your personal data with anyone else for their own marketing purposes unless we have your permission to do this.
Some of our webpages use plug-ins from other organisations (such as the “Facebook Recommend”function, retweet function, Google+ function). These other organisations may use personal data about your visit to our site. If you browse the Jobs website, information they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.
International data transfers
Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:
We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.
Where we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.
If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.
Keeping your personal data
We keep your personal data for only as long as we need it. How long we need you personal data depends on what we are using it for. For example, if you have applied for a particular job using the Guardian Jobs website and submitted your CV, we keep your CV on our database for six months. For some jobs advertised on Guardian Jobs, you will be redirected directly to the recruiter or employer and we will not receive your CV or application. We are not responsible for how recruiters or employers who have received your CV store your details or CV.
We will delete your Guardian Jobs profile and any remaining CV after 30 months of inactivity or make it anonymous by removing all your details that identify you. If we asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we will not send you any marketing in future.
You can delete your Guardian Jobs account by using the “Delete” button at the bottom of your account page when you have signed in to the Jobs website.
How we may contact you
Marketing communications
When you have a Jobs website profile and/or added your CV to our searchable database you can choose to receive Job match emails that are tailored to your job preferences, for example, sector and location. If you no longer want to receive these emails, you can unsubscribe by clicking the link at the bottom of each email.
If you have opted in for theguardian.com marketing emails or signed up for Job Match emails through the Jobs website, you can receive general jobs newsletter emails/ Job match emails suggesting new vacancies. These may be based on your Guardian Job profile. You can unsubscribe from these emails by clicking the link at the bottom of each email.

If you have agreed to receive notifications on your mobile device via the Jobs app, we will use these to tell you about relevant job matches. You can turn off notifications any time in your app settings.

If you have raised a query or a complaint with our support teams, we may contact you about this to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.
Online Advertising
Online advertising on Guardian Jobs
On Guardian Jobs we use personalised online advertising. This which allows us to deliver more relevant advertising to people who visit the Jobs website. It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our website. It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you.
As you browse our site, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests. For instance if you have been reading a lot about a specific job field, we may show you advertising for jobs in this field.
We do not collect or use information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number for personalised online advertising.
We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners. This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on the Jobs website. We may also show you advertising on the Jobs website based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.
Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you adverts based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites.
For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.
Advertising that we place on our site or on other sites
We also use personalised online advertising to promote our own products and services. This means that you may see personalised online advertising for our own products and services on our sites (and our other platforms, such as theguardian.com) and when you are on other, third party websites, including social media platforms.
