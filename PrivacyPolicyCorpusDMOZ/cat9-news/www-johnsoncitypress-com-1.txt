GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; DISPUTESYou agree that all disputes, actions, and claims relating to your access to or use of the site, Services, and all matters arising out of or related to these Terms of Use (except for legal action taken to seek an injunction or other equitable relief related to the Site, Services, or user generated content, or claims related to the validity or enforceability of your or our intellectual property rights) (collectively “Dispute”) will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), federal arbitration law, and laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to choice of law principles.You furthermore agree that any Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.In the event of a Dispute, you or Johnson City Press must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Johnson City Press at 204 W Main St, Johnson City, TN 37604. You and Johnson City Press will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Johnson City Press may commence arbitration. You are not required to wait 60 days to file a small claims action.The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Washington, Carter, Sullivan, State of Tennessee. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Johnson City Press will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submission, or in person by following the AAA rules. In a Dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.You agree that the making of claims or resolution of Disputes pursuant to this agreement shall be in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. You agree that to the extent permitted by applicable law, that any and all Disputes will be resolved individually in the forum designated in this section, without resort to any form of class action.To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute to which this section applies must be filed within one year in small claims court or in arbitration with the AAA. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute could first be filed. If such a Dispute isn't filed within one year, it's permanently barred.If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.7.
