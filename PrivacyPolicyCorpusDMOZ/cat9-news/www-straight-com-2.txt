If readers return their purchases because they’re dissatisfied or the recommendation is bad, we make nothing.This helps support our work,  and ensures that our writers can continue to publish news, reviews, how-tos, and analysis to the highest editorial standards, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay.We are a participant in several affiliate programs including the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. All linked items are ones that we truly love.That said, we also apply affiliate links for Impact.com, CJ.com, Rakuten Advertising, ShareASale.com, Viglink.com, Skimlinks.com, Awin.com and other reputable online retailers and affiliate networks. The choice of one affiliate source over another should not be interpreted as an editorial endorsement, and we can't guarantee that the link we've chosen represents the product's best current price.
