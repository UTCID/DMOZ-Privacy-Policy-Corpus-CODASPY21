MANCHESTER — Detectives are urging the scores of people who might have witnessed a shooting that led to a double homicide to come forward with information that could help close the case.
Around 2 a.m. Aug. 2, Connecticut State Police troopers from the Troop H barracks responded to a reported shooting in the commuter lot off Buckland Street in Manchester and found two gunshot wound victims.
The victims were taken to the hospital, where 20-year-old Jennifer Hicks, of Massachusetts, died later that day, police said.
The second shooting victim, 24-year-old Massachusetts resident Gregory Scott, died from his injuries at the hospital two days later, police said.
“It was determined that approximately 100 to 200 people were at the scene at the time of the shooting and could possibly have witnessed this incident,” police said.
On Thursday, in an updated call for witnesses to come forward, state police said the suspect vehicle is believed to be a 2016 Dodge Ram 1500. Police said there were at least three occupants in the vehicle at the time of the shooting.
