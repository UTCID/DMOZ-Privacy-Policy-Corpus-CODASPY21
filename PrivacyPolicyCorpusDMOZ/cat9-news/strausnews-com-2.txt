PRIVACY POLICY
We are committed to protecting
consumer privacy online.  The purpose of our policy is to inform you about
the types of information we gather about you when you visit strausnews.com or
any of its sister sites, which include but are not limited to
advertisernewsnorth.com, advertisernewssouth.com, spartaindependent.com,
townshipjournal.com, warwickadvertiser.com, thephoto-news.com,
chroniclenewspaper.com, westmilfordmessenger.com, pikecountycourier.com,
nypress.com, ourtownny.com, westsidespirit.com, otdowntown.com, chelseaclintonnews.com,
and dirt-mag.com (collectively, the “Straus News Sites”).  The policy also describes
how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the
choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that
information.
How You Accept This Policy
By visiting any of the Straus News Sites, or by otherwise providing us with
personally identifiable information (such as an email address), you agree to
the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
How We Gather Information from
Users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the
activities in which you elect to participate, and the services provided.
You can visit some pages on the Straus News Sites without affirmatively
providing any information.  Other pages may prompt you to provide
information, such as when you submit a press release, business milestone,
letter to the editor, or a photo to a Straus News Site. You may also provide
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and
polling activities, photo galleries, message boards, and other areas of the
Straus News Sites.
When you submit any of the above
information, we may collect personal information (“PI”), such your first name
and last name, address, or email address, which you choose to provide to
us.    We may collect PI if you contact us or otherwise give it
to us (e.g., in an email).
Like most websites, we also collect
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may not
be transparent to our visitors. We may collect information about the computer,
mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer, or other device you use to
access Straus News.  For example, we may log the name of your Internet
Service Provider or use “cookie” technology. Among other things, the cookie may
store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
encounter a particular advertisement while visiting the Site.  As we adopt
additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may
inhibit the Straus News Sites’ functionality.
What We Do With The Non-Personally
Identifiable Information We Collect
We may use information that is not personally identifiable to enhance the
visitor experience of the Straus News Sites, to operate and maintain the Straus
News Sites, to investigate and understand how the Straus News Sites are used, to
monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Straus News Sites, and to
analyze our business.  As one example, we may combine information about
your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn
which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive.
Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.
How We Use And Disclose PI
We may use PI to email you or to otherwise communicate with you about
activities relating to the Straus News Sites and our business, including
marketing and promotion.  You can opt out of receiving future promotional
and advertising related emails and electronic communications by following the unsubscribe
link in any such emails.
We may use PI to enhance the
visitor experience of the Straus News Sites, to operate and maintain the Straus
News Sites, to investigate and understand how our Service are used, to analyze
our business, and to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the
Straus New Sites.
We may disclose PI as required by
law or in response to service of legal process, such as a court order, summons,
subpoena, or the like.
We may share PI with trusted
partners who provide services related to the Straus News Sites (such as website
hosting).  These trusted partners do not have the right to use this PI for
any purpose other than those related to the Straus New Sites.
Information about our users,
including PI, may be disclosed or transferred to entities now or in the future
affiliated with us or as part of any merger, acquisition, change of control,
debt financing, insolvency, bankruptcy or sale of our assets, and may be used
in the businesses of any entity so receiving it.
Although we do not do so now, we
may aggregate your PI with that of other users and sell it to third parties.
What Information We Do Not Collect
When you share or recommend articles or content from any Straus News Site on
Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party social media platform, that action
is governed by the third-party site’s respective privacy policy.  We do
not track or store a record of those comments or actions, and you should take
care to review the third-party’s privacy policy before sharing any such
content.
Moreover, Straus News does not
knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about
children under the age of 13.  If we discover we have received any
information from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this policy, we
will delete that information immediately. If you believe, the Straus News Sites
have any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact
us at webmanager@strausnews.com.  Children under the age of 13 are
specifically prohibited from registering as Members of strausnews.com.
Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites And
Advertisements
Straus News expects its partners, advertisers, and third-party affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users.  However, third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates, and other content providers accessible
through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and
practices.  For example, during your visit to the Straus News Sites you
may follow a link to, or view as part of a frame on a Straus News Site, certain
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.  Also,
through the Straus News Sites you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, websites, advertisements, features, contests, or sweepstakes
offered by other parties.  Straus News is not responsible for the actions
or policies of such third parties.
While on our site, our advertisers,
promotional partners, or other third parties may use cookies or other
technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve
information about you.  For example, some of our advertising may be served
by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.  Through
features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other
technology to gather information.  Straus News does not control the use of
this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any
actions or policies of such third parties.
Please be careful and responsible
whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose personally
identifiable information in public areas on the Site, such as in message
boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can
be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Strausnews.com and
this policy.
How Do I Opt-Out or Correct
Information About Me
You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from
Straus News.  We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us at the point where we request information about
you.  To do so, you can send us a message at webmanager@strausnews.com.
Data Security
We do our best to preserve the integrity and security of your PI.  We
cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit to the
Service, and you do so at your own risk.  Depending on where you live, you
may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing or by
emailing us at webmanager@strausnews.com.
International Visitors
This Service is hosted in the United States.  If you are an international
visitor, you should note that by providing your PI, you are:  (i)
permitting the transfer of your PI to the United States which may not have the
same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and (ii)
permitting the use of your PI in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Changes to this policy
If we make any changes to this policy, we will post such changes on this
page.  Such changes shall become effective immediately upon posting and,
unless provided otherwise, will not apply retroactively.  If we make any
material changes and you have provided us with an e-mail address, we will do
our best to notify you of any such changes.
