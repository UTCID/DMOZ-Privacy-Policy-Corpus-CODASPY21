These obituaries may be sent via e-mail to obituaries@gctelegram.com to ensure they are precisely as the client requests. — The Telegram will re-print obituaries if there is a mistake or omission. If the mistake/omission is the newspaper's fault, the re-print is free. If the mistake/omission is the fault of the funeral home or family, the cost is $5.55 per column inch, which is half price of a custom obituary.If you have any questions, please contact Debbie at (620) 275-8500 or e-mail obituaries@gctelegram.com
