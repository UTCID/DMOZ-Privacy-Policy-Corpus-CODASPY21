("Company") strives to offer users of its online services the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. In order to do so, we may obtain certain personal information from you.

This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated as a part of Company's Terms of Use available at www.portlavacawave.com/terms-of-use/terms_of_use.html. Throughout this Privacy Policy, "we" or "our" refers to Company, and "you" or "your" refers to the person or entity who accesses or uses the Site and Services or its content (the "User"). This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected online through the Site and Services.Right To Change PolicyCompany reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to alter this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice to any User, including to comply with privacy laws, regulations and/or our own or industry standards or otherwise. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy each time you access or use our Site and Services. Your use of our Site and Services at any time, including after any change to this Privacy Policy, indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, and any change made to this Privacy Policy or such Terms of Use.COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION FROM USERSWe may collect information on our Users in various ways, including by your voluntary submissions, through various promotions, and through "cookie" (as explained below) and other tracking technology. The information we collect is used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: fulfilling and providing services requested by you; improving the Site and Services; notifying you about updates to the Site and Services; and/or informing about products, services and promotions in which you may have interest. With your authorization or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, we may also share the information you provide with third parties.Personally Identifiable InformationPersonally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, e-mail, postal address or credit card information, and possibly information relating to certain support or customer service issues (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information"). You generally do not need to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information to use the Site and Services or to obtain information from most of the features on the Site and Services.In some cases, however, you may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information in order to access or use certain pages and services of the Site and Services, or to allow us to provide you with certain personalized or enhanced services that you have requested. How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. As noted, you can access or use many pages and services on our Site and Services without providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Other pages may prompt you to provide Personally Identifiable Information.If you do not want to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information, you can always decide not to use certain services or access certain pages on the Site and Services. The choice is yours.Please remember that if you post any Personally Identifiable Information in public areas of the Site and Services, such as on bulletin boards or chat rooms, such information may be collected and used by other Users over whom Company has no control. Company is not responsible for the use made by third parties of any information you post or otherwise make available to others through the Site and Services.Aggregate InformationFrom time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on. This information represents a generic overview of our Users' collective viewing habits and allows us and other third parties to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies", which are discussed in greater detail in this Privacy Policy. We collect this information in order to determine, for example, which areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site and Services for visitors. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Services to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. From time to time, we may use this information to optimize third-party offers of products and/or services. We also may share aggregated demographic and preference data with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other users of the Site and Services.Cookies and Other Tracking TechnologiesLike most websites and related digital properties, the Site and Services also may collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to Users. For example, Company may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of "cookies".

These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Site and Services for you and other Users of our Site and Services.We may link the information we record using tracking technologies to Personally Identifiable Information we collect at the Site and Services for our own and our marketing partners' marketing and advertising purposes.
