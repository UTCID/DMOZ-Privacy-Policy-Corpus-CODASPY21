Privacy and Accountability Project
Everyone likes privacy. But too often, secretive government agencies manipulatively invoke “privacy” to conceal information of public importance, from body-cam arrest videos to personnel records of fired sexual harassers. When the public hears “privacy,” we hear “secrecy.” The Privacy and Accountability Project works toward a sensible balance between privacy and transparency, informed by the knowledge that concealment benefits wrongdoers and enables them to victimize others.
