Privacy Policy
Privacy policy – May 2018 IntroductionThis Policy sets out the obligations of Digital Resolutions Limited (“the Company”) regarding data protection and the rights of customers, suppliers, employees, workers and contractors (“data subjects”) in respect of their personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).The GDPR defines “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.This Policy sets out the procedures that are to be followed when dealing with personal data.  The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company. The Data Protection PrinciplesThis Policy aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply.  All personal data must be:processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;b) collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without delay;e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing The GDPR seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject.The GDPR states that processing of personal data shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.The Company does not generally rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or direct mail. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us. Processed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes4.1 The Company collects and processes the personal data set out in section 21 of this Policy. This may include personal data received directly from data subjects (for example, contact details used when a data subject communicates with us) and data received from third parties (for example, potential employee personal data, tender requests from potential customers/suppliers).4.2 The Company only processes personal data for the specific purposes set out in sections 3 and 21 of this Policy (or for other purposes expressly permitted by the GDPR) unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.  The purposes for which we process personal data will be informed to data subjects at the time that their personal data is collected, where it is collected directly from them, or as soon as possible after collection where it is obtained from a third party.4.3 If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.  Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required by law. Adequate, Relevant and Limited Data Processing The Company will only collect and process personal data for and to the extent necessary for the specific purpose(s) informed to data subjects as under section 4, above. Accuracy of Data and Keeping Data Up To Date The Company shall ensure that all personal data collected and processed is kept accurate and up-to-date and that any changes advised by data subjects are updated on a timely basis. The accuracy of data shall be checked when it is collected. Where any inaccurate or out-of-date data is found or advised by the data subject, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend or erase that data, as appropriate. Timely Processing The Company shall not keep personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which that data was originally collected and processed.  The Limitation Act 1980 requires that information relating to contract and arrangements are retained for the length of the contract plus 6 years.  When the data is no longer required, all reasonable steps will be taken to erase it on a timely basis. Secure Processing The Company shall ensure that all personal data collected and processed is kept secure and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.Further details of the data protection and organisational measures which shall be taken are provided in sections 22 and 23 of this Policy.9.
