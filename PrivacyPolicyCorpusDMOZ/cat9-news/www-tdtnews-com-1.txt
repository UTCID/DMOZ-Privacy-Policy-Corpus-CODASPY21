Temple Daily Telegram Privacy PolicyThe Temple Daily Telegram is committed to respecting your privacy rights when visiting its website. To protect your Personal Information, The Temple Daily Telegram has created the guidelines outlined below. Understanding that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, any changes to this policy will be promptly posted on this page, with an updated “effective date” at the bottom of the page. Information Collected While visiting www.tdtnews.com (hereinafter referred to as the “Site”), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) for purposes of interacting with the Site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. What are Cookies? A cookie is a small data text file that a web site sends to your browser, which is stored on your system. The Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Site. We cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration system, or by entering a sweepstakes or promotion. Why does the Site use cookies? The Temple Daily Telegram uses cookies to determine whether you are a registered guest and to track usage of the Site. By tracking usage, we can determine what features of the Site best serve the users. What benefits do I receive from cookies? Cookies identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your nickname, name, and e-mail address each time you access portions of the Site that are subject to registration. May I decline to accept a cookie? You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, portions of the Site that are subject to registration will continuously invite you to register, which might hamper your positive experience on the Site.

To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through the Site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply and the Temple Daily Telegram shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information.Our Site may carry co-branded pages, and other sites may use the Site’s name. Since The Temple Daily Telegram does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and the Temple Daily Telegram shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties’ privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others. Links to Other Materials Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control of the Temple Daily Telegram.
