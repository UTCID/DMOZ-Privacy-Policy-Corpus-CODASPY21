Michigan State Police have issued a statewide search for a missing Saginaw County man.
On Sept. 17 at about 9:50 a.m., troopers from the MSP Tri-City Post were dispatched to a residence in Kochville Township to investigate a missing person. Karl Adam Marker, an 87-year-old man, left his residence on this morning at about 8 a.m. He was heading to the Fashion Square Mall in Saginaw, where he would frequently go to walk for about an hour. Marker did not return home.
He was last seen driving his 2011 GMC Savannah van. It is described as a light tan or silver in color vehicle with a Michigan license plate AUY500. According to his family, Marker suffers from dementia.
A statewide search has been active since Thursday morning and troopers have investigated and exhausted every investigative lead thus far.
On Friday morning, a tip directed investigators to the James Township Hall, where a person matching Marker’s description was asking for directions to the mall. MSP has conducted ground and air searches of the surrounding area and every possible route between Marker’s home and the mall.
In addition to a statewide "be on the lookout" order, this information has been posted on billboards across the state. These efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
MSP is looking to engage every citizen in the state to locate Marker. He may have traveled well outside of the Tri-City area. Please watch for him and/or his van. Pictures have been provided to all MSP media partners. Marker is an 87-year-old white man, about 5-feet, 7-inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. He has blue eyes and grey hair.
If you have any have any information or see him or his vehicle, contact the Michigan State Police Tri-City Post at 989-495-5555 or 9-1-1. MSP is hopeful that, with the public's help, they can safely reunite Marker with his family.
