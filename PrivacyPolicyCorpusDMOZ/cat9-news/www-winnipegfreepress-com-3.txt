Why can't I create an account using a social network?
Some websites allow you to sign in with social media sites like Facebook or LinkedIn. When you do that, information is shared back and forth with that site. We do not want to share any of your information with anyone else, so we do not have interest in using a service like that. We value your privacy and information, and don't think other sites should have access to it.

We're sorry to hear you're having trouble logging in. If you're seeing an error saying your password is incorrect and you're sure you've entered the right password:
Make sure that your caps lock key is turned off and try again
Reset your password
Try using a different web browser (ex: Firefox, Internet Explorer)
Try upgrading your browser and resetting your password again
I keep getting logged out!
You probably don't have cookies turned on in your browser. Make sure you enable them so your browser saves your login session on winnipegfreepress.com (and other sites). If you're not sure how to turn on cookies, try a search for how to turn on cookies in your specific browser (ex: Internet Explorer, Firefox). Sometimes people have trouble staying logged in if the clock on their computer or phone isn't set to the correct date and time. Check that your clock is set correctly, and have your clock set automatically, if you can.
