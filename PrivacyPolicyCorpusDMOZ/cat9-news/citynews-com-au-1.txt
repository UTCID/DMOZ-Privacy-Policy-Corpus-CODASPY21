Customer Complaints and Grievances Policy
Macquarie Publishing is committed to handling customer grievances and complaints fairly, efficiently and effectively.
We are passionate about providing our customers with service excellence for every interaction. We demonstrate this by:
Treating our customers with respect, courtesy and providing a professional level of service;
Listening and asking questions so that we understand your needs and expectations;
Being accountable for the actions we agree upon to resolve your complaint with us.
Editorial complaints
Macquarie Publishing’s staff writers have tertiary qualifications and abide by the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance’s code of ethics.
If you believe editorial standards have been breached or you have an editorial complaint, please contact Macquarie Publishing directly on 02 6189 0777 or email editor@citynews.com.au
The Editor and Board will apply the following criteria in determining proportionate complaint handling:
seriousness of the matter;
likelihood of harm;
potential to mislead;
scale of audience response; and
degree of risk of damage to public trust and confidence in Macquarie Publishing.
Where practicable and warranted, Macquarie Publishing will endeavour to resolve complaints.
For proven errors or inaccuracies that are printed in the CityNews magazine, we will publish a retraction / correction as soon as practically possible. For proven errors or inaccuracies in citynews.com.au, we will amend the website as soon as practically possible.
As a news organisation that principally reflects the social history of Canberra, we publish online and in our printed magazine images and stories about the people of Canberra. The integrity of our materials are inviolable and Macquarie Publishing has copyright arrangements regarding all material in our magazine and online.
Requests to remove material from citynews.com.au will be considered if it can be demonstrated that the complainant’s life or personal security is imperilled.
We will seek to deal with complaints as quickly as possible and aim to respond within 15 days of receipt.
In cases where a complainant repeatedly submits complaints which are frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith, it may be appropriate to consider terminating all correspondence. Macquarie Publishing will also consider terminating correspondence with a complainant on a particular issue in cases where the Macquarie Publishing has clearly been unable to satisfy a complainant, despite reasonable efforts having been made.
