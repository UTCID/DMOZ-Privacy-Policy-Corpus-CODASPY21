Poll
Should Bend designate itself as a Sanctuary City?
Oregon’s sanctuary state law, which has been in effect since 1987, already prohibits the use of state or local funds or resources for detecting or apprehending people whose only outstanding alleged crime is violating federal immigration laws — except when people who are charged with a criminal violation of federal immigration laws and are the subject of a court-ordered arrest.

Our local politicians have no spine and so will relent to the squeaky wheel of a couple hundred protesters (representing ~0.2% of our 100k+ city residents) effectively throwing a toddler tantrum. They're afraid of these mini mobs showing up to their house with their intimidation tactics (as in Portland and Seattle), so they'll give'em what they want. How shameful.

Of course in liberal Bend this means Illegals. Bend used to be a great place until it was Californicated.

Savvy move to slow down the emotional reactions and replace with sober, carefully researched, and properly analyzed information.Bend City Council has no relevant metrics to work from. No solid, reliable data on specific line items. They learned this the hard way when they rushed into the ICE "demonstration" and after the fact got educated.Good on the new approach. It woll pay huge long term dividends if seen through.

What is it about illegal immigrants these dimwits don't understand. Enough is enough. You want to look like Porland? These idiots will get you there.

Yet the article isn't all about illegal immigrants is it R/s. BTW, when you point that finger and call folks "dimwits", you forget there's three fingers pointing back at ya.
