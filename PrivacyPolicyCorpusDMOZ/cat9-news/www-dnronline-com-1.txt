This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for Web site traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.Daily News-Record may place a “cookie” on the browser of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the Web site. Daily News-Record uses the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, so Daily News-Record can customize delivery of information to you without compromising privacy. For example, cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same banner advertisement too often in a single session.Daily News-Record may, in the course of providing services through its Web site, ask you to disclose voluntarily certain information about yourself. This could include information that identifies you or your household. Any information in Daily News-Record’s possession solely as a result of your use of the Web site and that is associated with you or your household is considered “Personal Information.” It consists of both information supplied by you (e.g. name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) and information collected about how you use the Web site (e.g. the fact that you have bought merchandise through the Web site). “Personal Information” does not include statistical data about large numbers of users, none of whom are identifiable, nor does it include information that you have posted for public view on the Web site or otherwise publicly disclosed.Like many other commercial sites, the Web site may utilize an electronic file called a web beacon to count users who have visited a page or recognize users by accessing certain cookies. The Web site and/or the web sites of advertisers and merchants with which we have a relationship may use web beacons (a) for auditing purposes and to collect information from the web sites of certain advertisers or merchants; and (b) to report anonymous individual and/or aggregate information about our users from such advertisers or merchants. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with such advertisers or merchants. You may choose to opt-out by contacting us in accordance with the information set forth at the bottom of this privacy policy.Daily News-Record uses Personal Information only for purposes necessary to provide the Web site and other products and services to you. These purposes are:to process requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants;to perform such normal business operations as billing, collecting and accounting;to personalize and publicize the Web site based on your interests, including making you aware of editorial features, advertisements and commercial items; andto investigate complaints and to protect the Web site and Daily News-Record, its readers and employees as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by legal counsel for Daily News-Record. Except as necessary to process your requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured on the Web site, Daily News-Record does not rent, sell, barter or give away any lists containing Personal Information for use by any outside company. Daily News-Record also respects the privacy of data on your personal computer and does not access, read, upload or store data contained in or derived from your private files without your authorization.LinksThe Web site contains links to other sites. Daily News-Record is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with Daily News-Record (such as co-branded pages or “powered by” or “in cooperation with” relationships). Daily News-Record does not disclose personally identifiable information or unique identifiers to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to Daily News-Record’s control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policy of the sites you may visit by linking from the Web site.Opt Out ProceduresYou may always opt out of receiving future mailings or other information from Daily News-Record. If the mailing does not have an e-mail cancellation form, send us an e-mail detailing the type of information that you no longer desire to receive.Children’s PrivacyThe following additional terms, conditions and notices apply to use of the Web site by children under the age of 13 years whenever Daily News-Record becomes aware that a user is in that age range:Users under 13 years of age may not submit or post information on the Web site without the consent of the user’s parent or legal guardian. Prior to collecting any personal information about a child under 13, Daily News-Record makes reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the child’s parent after informing the parent about the types of information Daily News-Record will collect, how it will be used, and under what circumstances it will be disclosed.Although Daily News-Record will apply these children’s terms and conditions whenever it becomes aware that a user who submits Personal Information is less than 13 years old, no method is foolproof. Daily News-Record strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.“Personal information” collected from children may include any of the information defined above as “Personal Information” with respect to general users of the Web site and may be used by Daily News-Record for the same purposes. Except as necessary to process a child’s requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured on the Web site, Daily News-Record does not rent, sell, barter or give away any lists containing a child’s Personal Information for use by any outside company.If a child enters a game, contest or other activity sponsored by Daily News-Record on the Web site, the child may be required by Daily News-Record to provide the minimum Personal Information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in such activity.A child’s parent or legal guardian may request Daily News-Record to provide a description of the Personal Information that Daily News-Record has collected from the child, as well as instruct Daily News-Record to cease further use, maintenance and collection of Personal Information from the child.If a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address or other personally-identifying information on chat areas, bulletin boards or other forums or public posting areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. GeneralThese Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Daily News-Record with respect to use of the Web site, superseding all prior or contemporaneous communications and/or proposals. Daily News-Record reserves the right to make changes to these Terms and Conditions immediately by posting the changed Terms and Conditions in this location. By continuing to use the Web site, you are agreeing to all changes made by Daily News-Record.
