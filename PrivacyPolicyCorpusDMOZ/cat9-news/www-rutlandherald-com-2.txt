We will NEVER say to that advertiser, hey, one of those people in Orwell is Joe Smith, who visits our site 5 times a day, has a dog, three kids, makes $35,000 a year and is thinking about buying a snowmobile this year. That’s just creepy, but that’s what many internet companies are doing these days.)If you have any questions, you know where to find us – the contact info of our managers is right here on the website, and you can stop by and see us in person, too.These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established.
