The privacy practices of third parties are governed by their privacy policies, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of all websites and online services that you use, view, or visit.Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Other TechnologiesWe may use cookies, web beacons (also known as pixels), and other technologies to collect information when you use our services.A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website stores on your computer or device in the cookie file associated with the browser that you use to access the website. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies alone generally cannot be used to identify you. But if you choose the "Remember Me" feature or similar features, a cookie will store information that helps remember you, such as your username.Cookies help us recognize you when you return to our websites and hold information from one visit to the next for your ease of use. Cookies also help us better understand how people use our services through click-stream analysis. Further information on our use of cookies, including how to disable them or register your preferences regarding their use is contained in the Interest Based Advertising section of this Privacy Policy.Third-party content providers, advertisers, and advertising companies may place cookies on your computer or mobile device. Those cookies are controlled by the third parties and are not governed by this Privacy Policy. For information on how to disable third-party cookies and how to register your preferences regarding the use of some third-party cookies, see the Interest Based Advertising section of this Privacy Policy.We, and some of our advertisers, work with ad networks and ad delivery platforms that place retargeting pixels on users' computers to gather information about users' online activities, such as browsing histories and demographic information. This information can be aggregated into audience segments, which help deliver relevant advertising to users visiting our websites and third-party websites that use the same pixels.Some of our services and communications may contain tiny electronic images known as web beacons. We use web beacons to assist us in delivering cookies on our services and to allow us to count users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.Interest-Based AdvertisingTo help ensure that you receive ads that are relevant to your interests on our services, our advertisers' services, and elsewhere on the Internet, we and third-parties (including service providers, advertisers, and advertising companies) may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and apps. We, and third parties, may use that information to help understand audience segments. Advertisers may use the segments to determine the audience groups to which they wish to deliver particular ads. Through this process, we do not use information that directly identifies you.You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from some companies, including us and our service providers, by visiting the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, http://www.evidon.com/consumers-privacy/opt-out, and https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.

Please note that the interest-based advertising opt outs provided in the links above rely on the use of cookies. If you disable or delete cookies, you may remove your opt-out preferences. Deleting and/or controlling the use of cookies AND visiting the opt-out links above to register your preferences will help to ensure that you do not receive interest-based advertising. Again, this does not mean that you will not receive ads, it simply means that you will not receive ads that are tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate; if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so here.
