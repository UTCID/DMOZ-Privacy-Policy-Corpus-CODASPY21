Information Gathered
The Durango Herald gathers identifying information about website users (“Information”) only when a user provides that information on a voluntary basis such as by registering for or using an Account, Alerts, RSS feeds, by posting User Generated Content, by using social networking tools and the like. The Durango Herald does not sell, rent or lease user information to third parties. The Durango Herald occasionally may share Information with its affiliates and related companies. If you choose to use social networking tools available on the website, your favorites or other profile information may be shared with other website users who also use those social networking tools.
The Durango Herald periodically collects and analyzes log files, including IP addresses, from its servers. These files give a general picture of who is visiting the website and which pages are being viewed most often. This information is collected to assist The Durango Herald in the maintenance and administration of the website. The Durango Herald may share log file information with advertisers, but will refer only to general, aggregate usage data, not user specific identifying information.
The website will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on The Durango Herald or the website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of The Durango Herald; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the website, or the public. Except as noted above, The Durango Herald does not share any of the personal information you provide to us with any third party other than our service providers who assist us in providing information and/or services to you.
The Durango Herald also uses “cookie” technology that allows its servers to deposit codes on a user’s computer. This information helps determine the number of visitors to the website on an ongoing basis and the types of internet browsers and operating systems used by the website’s users. This information is used to enhance your website experience without notice, only if required to do so by us in providing information and/or services to you.
Third Parties
The Durango Herald offers to website users social networking tools that may include “friending," updating Profile information, posting comments on other users' Profiles and identifying website content or User Generated Content as something of interest to a particular user. When a user takes advantage of the social networking tools, the user agrees to share personal information with other users. The Durango Herald provides privacy tools within its social networking framework to enable users to control the types of this personal information that is shared with other users. If you post User Generated Content to the website that includes your User Name, email address or any other personally identifying information, you understand that that information can be read by any third party and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.
Process to Remove Your Personal Information
Most of The Durango Herald’s services include information on how to remove your information, and/or and cancel a particular service. We do not generally delete or remove accounts. Alternatively, you may send an email to herald@DurangoHerald.com to request the services and information you would like removed. Your request should include the specific reasons why The Durango Herald should remove identified content. The Durango Herald reserves the right to decline requests for removal of information based on maintaining the historical and archival nature of the website.
