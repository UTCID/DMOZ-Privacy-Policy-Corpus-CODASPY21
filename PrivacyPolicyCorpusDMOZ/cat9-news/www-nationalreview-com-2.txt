At National Review we believe you should know what data we collect from you and how we use it. We also believe you should be able to make the best decisions about the information you share with National Review. That is the spirit behind this privacy policy.
QUICK OVERVIEW OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We encourage all users of the National Review website to read our privacy policy in full. But here’s a quick rundown of the key themes in this policy.
National Review is both a magazine and a website. We offer subscriptions to our magazine, including a digital version of our magazine that is available on our website. “Digital” subscribers need to login to our site to access the digital magazine and more. When logged in, you have full access via our Customer Care website to the information applied to your subscription account. (NRPLUS / digital users: To reach Customer Care, login, click MY ACCOUNT in the top right of the site, and then click the red Customer Care site link. Print users: Click here to reach our Customer Care portal and enter your account number to access your Customer Care page.)
We receive personal information from you in a variety of ways. This information can come from what you give us directly, such as through a subscription, a newsletter sign-up, or a website comment. This information can also come from what you do not give us directly, such as data gathered by third parties (including advertisers) based on your browsing habits.
We use your behavior while on the National Review website to serve you additional content that you might like. In other words, we match your content selections with similar selections that you have not yet read. We hope this makes your website experience more rewarding.
You can control the information you give us. You can manage all of the information relative to your subscription on our Customer Care website. (Print users: Click here to reach our Customer Care portal and enter your account number to access your Customer Care page. NRPLUS / digital users: To reach Customer Care, login, click MY ACCOUNT in the top right of the site, and then click the red Customer Care site link.) You can unsubscribe from any e-mail series we send you. (You can do this directly within the e-mail.) You can opt out of targeted advertising as well (see the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance).
We encourage you to contact us at privacy@nationalreview.com with any questions you might have about our Privacy Policy and our practices regarding your personal information. European Union citizens may also contact privacy@nationalreview.com to request information on personal data that is being tracked or stored. Note: National Review, Inc., does not track and/or store any personally identifiable information (PII) on non-U.S. and non-subscribed users.
By subscribing to any of our digital-product offerings you accept our terms and agree to be tracked via login and other on-site actions deemed appropriate by the Publisher to deliver you the digital service you have requested.
GENERAL STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy exists to help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and/or use our website (www.nationalreview.com).
This privacy policy applies only to www.nationalreview.com. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that National Review does not control. Please note that our site may contain links to other websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on National Review and link to another website, then this privacy policy will not apply to any information collected on that website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website that you visit.
GENERAL STATEMENT ABOUT DATA COLLECTION & TARGETED ADVERTISING
The National Review website permits data collection for interest-based advertising. We and third parties may use cookies, web beacons or pixels, mobile ad identifiers, and other tracking technologies to facilitate site navigation, to better understand and improve our services, and to determine or improve the advertising shown to you on this website or elsewhere. We may use your information to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads and promotions on behalf of ourselves and advertisers on this website. This information may be combined with information collected across different websites, online services, and other linked or associated devices.
We and third parties may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and e-mails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a specific e-mail message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and determine the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing the use of our services and providing content and ads that are of greater relevance to you.
You may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance.
