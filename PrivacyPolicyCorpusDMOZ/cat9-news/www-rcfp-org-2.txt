Libel and Privacy
Journalists and news organizations are sometimes the targets of libel suits — lawsuits claiming they published false statements of fact, with some degree of fault, that caused harm to a plaintiff’s reputation. Similarly, journalists and news organizations accused of invasion of privacy sometimes become the subjects of privacy lawsuits. In many cases, libel and privacy lawsuits against the news media are merely frivolous attempts to silence legitimate news reporting. Journalists and news organizations often use anti-SLAPP laws to defend themselves against expensive, baseless lawsuits brought by the subject of an investigative story. Explore our work in this area below.
