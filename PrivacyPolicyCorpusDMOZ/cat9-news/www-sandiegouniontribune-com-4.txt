THE SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE, LLCADVERTISING AGREEMENT STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT OF PRINT, DIGITAL AND PREPRINT ADSEffective Date: April 22, 20191 ScopeThese terms and conditions govern all Orders (as defined in Section 3) for print, digital and preprint (insert and direct mail) advertising placements fulfilled by The San Diego Union-Tribune, LLC entities that publish and/or distribute such advertising (“Publishers”). Each Order and these terms and conditions together constitute the agreement (“Agreement”) between the advertiser (“Advertiser”) and the Publisher(s). The terms and conditions apply to all Orders entered into after the Effective Date above, and may be updated from time to time. The terms and conditions do not apply to brand publishing projects, such as social media management, website development, or creation of Paid Posts/Paid Content, Advertorial Content, or Work for Hire Content, each as defined below at Section 16.2 TermThe Term of this Agreement is defined in each Order (as defined in Section 3), either expressly as “the Term” or as the timeframe of the advertising campaign.3 Insertion Order / OrderAdvertiser has contracted with one or more Publishers for the publication or distribution of advertising as described in an Insertion Order (“IO”) or as otherwise ordered by Advertiser (non-IO order) (collectively, “Orders”). All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to every publication and/or distribution of an advertisement on Advertiser’s behalf (each, an “Ad”). No terms of an Order or other communication from Advertiser that contradict or are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding on Publisher, unless in writing and signed by both parties.4 Representations and Warranties; Compliance with LawsAdvertiser represents, warrants and covenants that (a) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; (b) its performance of this Agreement will not violate any contracts with third parties; (c) all materials and digital files submitted to Publisher (“Ad Material”) do not contain any computer viruses or other damaging code; (d) all Ad Material and campaigns do not violate any rights of any third parties, including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patents, trade secrets, right to privacy, right of publicity (“Intellectual Property Rights”), and civil rights; and (e) it is familiar with and all Ad Materials and campaigns comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and FTC and industry guidelines, including but not limited to: local, state and federal laws regarding political advertising and fair housing, and Native Advertising: A Guide for Business at https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/native-advertising-guide-businesses (December 2015). By way of emphasis, Advertiser represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary consents and releases before submitting Ad Material, and all statements and direct and indirect claims made in each Ad are accurate, not defamatory, and true and supported by competent and reliable substantiation.Digital Advertiser also represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that (a) its Ads and ad campaigns will comply with Publisher’s privacy policy, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/obaprinciples; and (b) its email campaigns will comply with the 2003 CAN-SPAM Act.5 Ad Preparation and Acceptance for All Placements5.1 No Legal ReviewPublisher does not assume any obligations to perform legal review of Ads.5.2 Ad PreparationOn request, Publisher may assist Advertiser in preparing its Ads for publication. This assistance may include design, composition, text and artwork. Publisher retains all rights, including copyright, to all Ad layouts and other elements that represent the creative effort of Publisher or contain material prepared by Publisher. Advertiser shall not authorize photographic or other reproduction of any such Ad layout in any other publication without the express written consent of Publisher. Advertiser remains solely responsible for the contents of the Ad(s) and for compliance with any laws regulating such advertising as represented by Advertiser in Section 4 above.5.3 Ad AcceptanceSubmission of an Ad to Publisher does not constitute a commitment by Publisher to publish or distribute the Ad. Publisher in its sole discretion will decide whether to publish an Ad. Publisher accepts an Ad only by publishing or distributing such Ad.5.4 Ad Material DeliveryFailure of Advertiser to meet any deadlines may result in additional charges and changes in publication or distribution dates.Advertiser shall be responsible for timely providing to Publisher all Ad Material necessary for publication and distribution of the Ads, including all necessary artwork and/or digital files, the timing and formats of which may be more specifically set forth in the Order or in Publisher’s media kit. In the event that all necessary materials are not received in time for the scheduled run date, and unless otherwise specifically instructed by Advertiser, Publisher may, at its sole discretion, use artwork or other materials from previous Ads placed by Advertiser, if applicable. Publisher will not be responsible for Ad Material that is not properly formatted or displayed or that cannot be accessed or viewed because it was not received by Publisher in the proper form, in a timely manner, or in an acceptable technical quality for mobile or online publication.Ad Materials that do not conform to the Order may result in a higher price. See Section 8.1 on Liability for Errors / Omissions / Cancellations.Publisher prohibits, and may postpone, cancel or otherwise return, any Ad Material that violates its advertising standards, including but not limited to advertising that violates applicable laws, promotes pornography, illegal goods, illegal drugs, illegal drug paraphernalia, pirated computer programs, and instructions on how to assemble or otherwise make bombs, grenades or other weapons.5.5 Rejection and Alteration of AdsTo ensure the integrity of our publications and for the benefit of our readers and advertisers, Publisher reserves the right to revise, reclassify, edit or reject any Ad Material or any portion thereof at any time. Publisher at all times reserves the right to refuse to publish any Ad text or other content for any reason and regardless of whether any such Ad Material was previously accepted by Publisher. Publisher reserves the right to alter any Ad Material in order for the material to conform to Publisher’s current mechanical or technical specifications. The rates stated in the Order or rate card shall remain the same upon a reduction in the size of any Ad as long as the Ad maintains the same proportion of the entire page. Print rates are based on column inch size rather than actual published size, which may have shrinkage related to the printing process.5.6 Position RequestsFor print Ads, placement or location of advertising is not guaranteed. Any specific ad placement condition shall not be legally binding upon Publisher but will be treated as a request only and Publisher shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement if it does not publish or distribute an Ad in a requested position.5.7 Labeling of AdsWhen, in the opinion of Publisher, any Ad resembles news matter, such Ad shall be plainly designated as advertising by the word “Advertisement” or other such designation deemed appropriate by Publisher.6 Ad Preparation, Acceptance and Other Terms for Digital Ads Only6.1 Delivery of Ad MaterialFor digital Ads, Publisher will make final technical specifications electronically accessible to Advertiser at mediakit.sandiegouniontribune.com/specs. If Ad Materials are delivered late, Publisher is not required to guarantee full delivery of the IO. In cases in which the applicable IO is for share-of-voice placement or otherwise not for impression-based delivery, if the Ad Materials are not received by Publisher in time for launch, then Publisher may charge the Advertiser on the IO start date on a pro rata basis.6.2 Rejection of AdsPublisher shall notify Advertiser when it rejects Ad Materials due to unsatisfactory technical quality, inappropriate content, or any other reason.6.3 Replacement or Removal of Digital AdvertisingOnce submitted, Advertiser may replace or cancel creative copy for Ads only with 48 hours prior written notice to Publisher.6.4 Digital ImpressionsIf Advertising is based on a specified number of impressions (CPM), an impression will be counted according to Publisher’s standard practices. Without limiting the foregoing, an impression will be counted whenever served by Publisher, regardless of viewability, whether served to an end user or to an intermediate or third party ad server (“Third Party Ad Server”), and/or whenever Publisher sends a request to a Third Party Ad Server to serve any Ad. Ads may include a link to Advertiser’s website by using the “back” button on their browser or any other standard means. In the event that advertising is preempted, Publisher will substitute advertising of comparable value.6.5 Digital Third Party Ad Serving and TrackingPublisher will track delivery of impressions on its websites through its ad server and, provided that Publisher has approved in writing a Third Party Ad Server to run on its properties, Advertiser will track delivery through such Third Party Ad Server. Advertiser may not substitute the specified Third Party Ad Server without Publisher’s prior written consent. If the difference between Publisher’s measurement and the Third Party Ad Server measurement exceeds 10% over the Invoice period and the Third Party Ad Server measurement is lower, the parties will facilitate a reconciliation effort between Publisher and Third Party Ad Server measurements. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved and a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation has been made, the Advertiser reserves the right to either: (a) consider the discrepancy an under-delivery and Advertiser and Publisher will use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the conditions of a makegood flight; and delivery of any makegood will be measured by the Third Party Ad Server, or (b) pay the Invoice based on the Third Party Ad Server measurement, plus a 10% upward adjustment to delivery. If the discrepancy exceeds 20%, the Advertiser reserves the right to either: (x) consider the discrepancy an under-delivery and Advertiser and Publisher will use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the conditions of a makegood flight; and delivery of any makegood (provide substitute advertising of comparable value) will be measured by the Third Party Ad Server, or (y) pay the Invoice based on the average of the Third Party Ad Server measurement and Publisher’s measurement. Invoice is defined in Section 7.2.1.6.6 Digital OwnershipAs between the parties, Publisher owns all right, title and interest in and to all content on the Publisher websites (except for Ad Materials) and all other content, HTML and other code. Nothing in this Agreement or otherwise precludes Publisher from using any code, design, idea, concept or material used in connection with this Agreement on behalf of itself or any third party. Publisher owns all right, title and interest in and to any data about users of its websites. Advertiser authorizes Publisher to bring any claims Publisher may, in its reasonable discretion choose to pursue to prevent third party use of the content or data contained in any Advertising, without Advertiser’s consent.6.7 Digital Collected Data UsageProvided that Advertiser complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and applicable industry guidelines (including those named in Section 4 and its own privacy policy, available at https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/about/sd-san-diego-union-tribune-privacy-policy-20180625-story.html), Advertiser may use data regarding a campaign for retargeting a User (Publisher website visitor) or appending data to a non-public profile regarding a User for purposes other than performing an insertion order, so long as it is not joined with any IO details or data that would allow identification of Publisher or its Users. Advertiser may use advertising performance data for internal media planning purposes only, and may disclose qualitative evaluations of such data to its clients and potential clients only for the purpose of media planning and only when aggregated with other campaign data.6.8 Ad Preparation, Acceptance and Other Terms for Email Campaigns Only6.8.1 Email Campaigns: CAN-SPAM CompliancePursuant to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Advertiser agrees that the Advertiser will ensure that the “From” line at the time of delivery of the email Ad will be accurate in all particulars and identify the person or business who initiated the message. Upon signature of the IO, Advertiser will provide Publisher with a copy of its list of email addresses that have opted out of receiving commercial email from Advertiser, if it has such a list.6.8.2 Email Campaigns: Advertising ContentUpon signature of the IO, Advertiser will provide Publisher with images and other content it would like to include in its email Ad. In the event that Advertiser does not provide all content for the Ad, Publisher’s service provider will add additional content that the provider has the right to use for this purpose, and will retain its rights in such added content.6.8.3 Email Campaigns: ApprovalPublisher will provide Advertiser with a copy of the Ad to review prior to deployment of the email campaign. Advertiser must object to the Ad within 2 business days, or it will be deemed approved.6.8.4 Email Campaigns: Cancellation PolicyUpon receipt of a signed IO, work begins and expenses are incurred. Therefore, IOs for commercial email campaigns cannot be cancelled once submitted.7 Financial Terms7.1 RatesThis Agreement expressly incorporates the terms and conditions of any rate cards that apply to the publications in which you have requested that Ads be placed. If there is a conflict between your Order and the rate card or the price quoted by Publisher, the Order will control. Unless otherwise specified in the Order, Advertiser agrees to pay Publisher’s published rates in effect for applicable advertising at the time of placement. For Agreements that contain a dollar-value commitment, Advertiser’s rate will change as its contract-to-date spending reaches higher levels; i.e., as Advertiser’s actual spend accumulates, future advertising will be charged at the rate corresponding to the higher dollar volume level, but rate changes are not applied retroactively. For example, if Advertiser commits to purchasing $1 million of advertising in one year, and Publisher’s rate card rates provide a volume discount that increases with volume, then the first purchases would be at the regular price, and the last purchases would be at the discounted price for $1 million.Rates for in-paper advertising appearing within news and feature sections of a newspaper are not tied to circulation.7.2 Payments and Disputes7.2.1 PaymentAdvertiser shall pay all Invoices within 15 days of Invoice date or as otherwise stated on the Invoice. “Invoice” means any electronic or paper request for payment regardless of the title of the document. Invoices may be titled “statement” or “bill.”7.2.2 CreditCredit privileges may be suspended on accounts that are not paid in accordance with terms. For prepaid accounts, payment in the form of check, credit card or ACH must be received in advance of space deadline from accounts that have not established credit with Publisher. Advertisers with established credit terms wishing to pay their account by using a credit card must make payment by the due date on the Invoice. It is the Advertiser’s responsibility to advise the Publisher credit department immediately, via registered mail, of any change in business structure or status.7.2.3 Invoice DisputesAdvertiser waives any dispute regarding any item included in an Invoice unless notice and amount of such dispute is provided to Publisher within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date. Send such notices to adbillinglat@caltimes.com adbilling@sandiegouniontribune.comor call the number on the Invoice.7.2.4 Late Payment and CollectionsExcept for invoiced payments that Advertiser has successfully disputed, Advertiser shall be responsible for all costs incurred by Publisher in connection with the collection of any amounts owing hereunder, including without limitation, collection fees, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.7.3 Rate ChangesPublisher shall have the right to revise the advertising rates set forth in this Agreement at any time upon notice to Advertiser of such rates. Advertiser may terminate this Agreement on the date the new rates become effective by giving written notice within 30 days of such termination. In the event of such termination, Advertiser shall be liable for Ads published prior to such termination at the Current Agreement Rate. “Current Agreement Rate” is defined as the billing rate in effect at the time of placement.If Publisher is printing the Ad and there is an increase in the cost of paper at any time during the Term of this Agreement, Advertiser understands and agrees that the advertising rates in the Order may be adjusted to reflect that increase automatically upon the effective date of the cost of paper increase.If Publisher is mailing the Ad and the U.S. Postal Service implements a postage cost increase at any time during the Term of this Agreement, Advertiser understands and agrees that the advertising rates set forth in this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect that increase automatically upon the effective date of the United States Postal Service increase.7.4 Insert PricingFor advertising inserts distributed via insertion in Publisher’s newspaper and/or via Publisher’s non-subscriber distribution program(s), quantity billed is based on the delivery quantity requirements provided by Publisher to Advertiser. Delivery quantity requirements are based on an estimate of circulation ordered plus an estimate for non-subscriber distribution, if any, plus provision for unsold copies of the newspapers, and an estimated amount for shipment and machine spoilage. Newspaper circulation is variable; therefore it is recommended that Advertiser confirm delivery quantity requirements with their advertising sales representative just prior to ordering a print run. However, Publisher shall not be responsible nor provide rate adjustments for shortages or overages in delivery quantity requirements realized through circulation fluctuations or for circulation missed caused by shortages in the Advertiser’s insert quantity provided.7.5 No Set-OffUnless otherwise agreed to by the parties, Advertiser may not set off against amounts due to Publisher under this Agreement any amounts owed by Publisher to Advertiser.7.6 TaxesAll prices are exclusive of all sales, use and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on any amounts payable by Advertiser pursuant to this Agreement. Advertiser shall be responsible for all such charges, costs and taxes and all amounts paid and payable by Publisher in discharge of the foregoing taxes. This provision shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.7.7 Other ServicesExcept as stated otherwise, payments by Advertiser to Publisher for services or goods other than advertising space, inserts and color shall not be applied toward any revenue totals set forth in the Agreement.8 Liability for Errors/Omissions/Cancellations8.1 For All PlacementsIt is Advertiser’s responsibility to check for errors in its Ads before and after publication or distribution. Publisher is not financially responsible for errors made by Advertiser in Ads. Advertiser shall check the first appearance of Ads for correction. If an error in an ad is attributable solely to Publisher, Publisher’s liability for an error shall not exceed the cost of the Ad, provided that Publisher shall not be liable for any error if, at Publisher’s option, Publisher subsequently publishes a corrected Ad.Publisher is not responsible for errors on copy received after deadline. Publisher assumes no financial responsibility for typographical errors, or for omission of copy of Ads.Advertiser shall be responsible for paying the rate card or media kit price for any Ads published based on Ad Materials that do not meet the criteria in the Order or media kit. For example, if the Order is for a black-and-white Ad, and Advertiser submits a color image, then Publisher will either convert the image to black-and-white, or have the right to use the color image in the Ad, and charge Advertiser the color Ad price.Publisher is not responsible for errors involving Orders, cancellations or corrections given orally. Written or facsimile confirmation of Orders, cancellations or corrections must be received prior to Publisher’s cancellation deadline. Publisher will publish and distribute Ads and bill Advertiser for all Orders that are not canceled prior to the deadline. Advertiser may be subject to a cancellation charge when such cancellation results in production delays.8.2 Digital OnlyExcept for Premium Lite advertising, if Publisher is unable to display any digital Ad for any reason, Publisher shall at its option either (a) provide substitute advertising of comparable value (“makegood”), or (b) refund to Advertiser a pro rata portion of the fee Advertiser has paid to Publisher. In the case of Premium Lite advertising, Advertiser accepts and agrees that it will receive neither makegood advertising nor a refund or have any other recourse in the event that Publisher does not reach the delivery goal or does not deliver any impressions at all. Such remedies are Advertiser’s sole remedy for Publisher’s failure to display Ads.8.3 Print OnlyAdvertiser agrees and understands that despite Publisher’s efforts, a relatively small number of daily newspapers may not carry Advertiser’s Ad as ordered, and that Advertiser’s Ad may not appear in all digital versions of the newspaper because advertising does not appear in some digital copies of the newspaper.Publisher’s liability for failure to publish or display any Ad or distribute any Ad insert shall be limited to a refund of any amount paid to Publisher for such placement.Publisher’s liability for errors or omissions in print display advertisements shall be limited to the cost of advertising space in an amount equal to the erroneous portion of the advertisement. Publisher’s liability for errors in distribution of advertising inserts shall be limited to the cost of distribution of the improperly distributed advertising inserts. Publisher shall have no liability for, and no credit shall be issued to Advertiser for, errors that do not materially affect the value of the advertisement or advertising insert or where Advertiser is responsible for the error or omission. Credits for errors in advertisements or advertising inserts materially affected by the error are allowed for the first publication or distribution only.Publisher assumes no responsibility for damage that occurs to mail pieces as a result of the processing and delivery operations of the U.S. Post Office.In the event the Advertiser has paid a premium for a particular position, damages for failure to publish in a particular position shall be limited to the refund of the premium paid. With respect to advertising inserts, such reimbursement shall be limited to a refund of that portion of the premium associated with the portion of the advertising inserts that were not distributed in accordance with the specific position request.9 IndemnificationAdvertiser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Publisher and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, principals, managers, members, partners, shareholders, employees, and controlling persons and their affiliates (Publisher and each such person being an “Indemnified Party”), against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, demands, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys’ fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification (collectively, “Losses”), arising out of or resulting from its breach of this Agreement; negligence or willful act or omission of Advertiser or its personnel or affiliates in connection with its performance of its obligations under this Agreement; the content of, or representations made in any Ad or any website linked to from an Ad; and any other claims of any nature arising from or attributable to the publication or distribution of any Ad.10 Limitation of LiabilityExcept with respect to Advertiser’s indemnification and confidentiality obligations, in no event will either party be liable to the other for any consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special or punitive damages whatsoever (including damages for loss of use, revenue or profit, business interruption and loss of information), whether arising out of breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, regardless of whether such damage was foreseeable and whether or not such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Publisher be liable to Advertiser for any amount greater than the amount paid by Advertiser to Publisher under this Agreement.PUBLISHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING ITS SERVICES OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, AND ANY WARRANTY REGARDING (a) THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO WILL ACCESS ANY ONLINE ADVERTISEMENT, ON ANY PUBLISHER WEBSITE OR THE ADVERTISER WEBSITE; (b) ANY BENEFIT ADVERTISER MIGHT OBTAIN FROM ANY ADVERTISING; AND (c) THE SPEED, ACCESSIBILITY, OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY ADVERTISING TO BE DISPLAYED ONLINE.11 Advertiser Represented by AgencyAgency’s representative represents and warrants that he or she has all necessary authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of Agency. Agency represents and warrants that it has all necessary authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of Advertiser. The parties agree that these terms and conditions shall prevail in the event of any conflicts between any terms and conditions of the Interactive Advertising Bureau followed by Agency and/or Advertiser and these terms and conditions.Any obligation of Advertiser pursuant to this Agreement may be satisfied by an advertising agency which has been duly appointed by Advertiser to act on Advertiser’s behalf (the “Agency”) and shall be deemed to be an obligation of Advertiser and the Agency. Additionally, any right of Advertiser pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised by the Agency, and shall be deemed to be a right of Advertiser and the Agency. Collectively, the Advertiser and Agency will be referred to as “Advertiser.” Each shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the other.Agency shall be liable for payment for all advertising placed and invoiced by each Publisher publication in which Agency places an advertisement, regardless of any contrary language in any past, contemporaneous or future writing, regardless of whether it receives payment from Advertiser, and regardless of whether the identity of the Agency’s client is known to such Publisher publication. Agency will make available to Publisher upon request written confirmation of the relationship between Agency and Advertiser and of Agency’s authorization to act on Advertiser’s behalf in connection with this Agreement. In addition, upon the request of Publisher, Agency will confirm whether Advertiser has paid to Agency in advance funds sufficient to make payments pursuant to the Order.12 License to Ad MaterialsAdvertiser grants Publisher a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license to copy, store, display, print and distribute any and all Ad Materials provided by Advertiser or its agents, including but not limited to photographs, artwork, text and graphics, in any media, presently known or unknown, including but not limited to Publisher’s electronic publications on the Internet and in any archival retrieval system whether that information is digitally stored or stored on any other media.Publisher has no obligation to return any material (including Ad Material) submitted to Publisher by or on behalf of Advertiser to Advertiser or any other party, and Publisher shall have no liability for its loss or destruction. Publisher and its service providers shall have the right to use any Ad published in or distributed by a Publisher publication for the purpose of promoting any of the products and services of Publisher or applicable service provider.13 ConfidentialityPublisher may disclose or make available to the Advertiser (as the “Receiving Party”) information about its business affairs and services, confidential information and materials comprising or relating to Intellectual Property Rights, third-party confidential information and other sensitive or proprietary information, as well as the terms of this Agreement including but not limited to the pricing and rates, whether orally or in written, electronic or other form or media, and whether or not marked, designated or otherwise identified as “confidential” (collectively, “Confidential Information”). The Advertiser shall from receipt/disclosure of such Confidential Information: (x) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Publisher’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Advertiser would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; (y) not use the Publisher’s Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (z) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person, except to the Advertiser’s representatives who need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Advertiser, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Advertiser shall be responsible for any breach of this Section caused by any of its representatives or agents. At any time during or after the Term, at the Publisher’s written request, the Advertiser and its representatives shall promptly return/destroy all Confidential Information and copies thereof that it has received under this Agreement.14 Termination(a) Publisher shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without notice to Advertiser, for Advertiser’s failure to remit payment for Invoices by the due date of such bills. (b) Publisher reserves the right to review the volume of advertising placed on a quarterly basis and to cancel the Agreement in its sole discretion if advertising placed falls 15% or more below the quarterly average volume needed to fulfill the twelve-month Agreement amount, if Advertiser has such an Agreement with Publisher. Failure of Publisher to review the frequency of advertising or cancel the Agreement for any reason shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to cancel in the future or to impose any applicable rate adjustment. (c) Subject to the terms of subsection (e) of this Section 14, Advertiser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time by written notice to Publisher. (d) Publisher shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for any reason and at any time by written notice to Advertiser, in which event and so long as Advertiser has been meeting its revenue, volume or other commitment to Publisher over time in a way that is consistent with Advertiser reaching its final commitment, Advertiser shall be liable for advertising prior to such termination at the Current Agreement Rate. (e) Except for a termination under Section 7.3 above, in the event the Agreement is terminated or for any other reason Advertiser fails to purchase during the Term of the Agreement the advertising generating the revenue, volume or other commitment due to Publisher, Advertiser immediately shall pay to Publisher the lesser of the following: (i) the original commitment made to Publisher under the Agreement or (ii) an amount for all advertising published during the Term including advertising previously billed (“Amount Due”), adjusted for space, inserts and color actually used. The unpaid balance of such adjusted Amount Due shall be based upon the “Actual Rate Earned” for advertising during the Term. The “Actual Rate Earned” is defined as the rate which would have been payable by Advertiser if the amount of advertising actually purchased during the Term had been contracted for in the first instance, and such Actual Rate Earned shall be ascertained by reference to the applicable Publisher rate card in effect on the date that the advertising was published.15 Other Terms15.1 Force MajeureExcept for payment obligations, neither party will be liable for failure to perform any obligation required under this Agreement when such failure is due to fire, flood, labor disputes or strikes, unavoidable accident, government action, legal restrictions, electronic or electrical interference, telecommunications difficulties, system failure, technical failure, equipment breakdown, failure of any third party system or product, or any other cause beyond the control of that party.15.2 AssignmentAdvertiser may not resell, assign, or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Publisher. All terms and conditions in this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted transferees, successors, and assigns.15.3 SeverabilityIf any provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other provision.15.4 Relationship of PartiesNothing in this Agreement creates any agency, joint venture, partnership or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the Parties.

Both parties hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in the county of the relevant publication.15.6 Complete Agreement, Modification, and WaiverThis Agreement constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive statement of the terms of the Agreement between the parties with respect to all advertising and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings or agreements of the parties, unless otherwise noted in this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified only by a written document signed by an authorized representative of both parties. Waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement by Publisher in any instance shall not prevent Publisher from subsequently enforcing any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.15.7 SurvivalSections 4 (Representations and Warranties; Compliance with Laws), 6.6 (Digital Ownership), 6.7 (Digital Collected Data Usage), 7.2 (Payments and Disputes), 7.5 (No Set-Off), 7.6 (Taxes), 8 (Liability for Errors / Omissions / Cancellations), 9 (Indemnification), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (Advertiser Represented by Agency), 12 (License to Ad Materials), 13 (Confidentiality), 14 (Termination) and 15 (Other Terms) shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.16 Defined Terms – Advertising Content Not Covered by this Agreement16.1 “Advertorial Content/Paid Posts/Paid Content”“Advertorial Content” means content produced by Publisher’s advertising department for Client or provided by Client for publication by Publisher to promote the Client’s product or service or otherwise reflect the views of those clients. Publisher labels this content “Advertising,” “From our Advertisers,” “Paid Posts,” or “Paid Content” in a typeface that is at least the size of the body type of the article or presentation, so as to not confuse or potentially mislead readers into believing that is it produced by any of Publisher’s news or editorial departments.
