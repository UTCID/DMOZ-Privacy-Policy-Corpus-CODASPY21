Last revision date: April 18, 2019
This policy describes Extreme Music Library Ltd and its affiliates’ use of your data. References in this policy to Extreme, we or us shall mean Extreme Music Library Ltd.
This Privacy Policy applies to the information collected by Extreme both offline and online, including through the Extreme Website and through any interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks and other online or wireless offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology (collectively “Extreme Websites”).
Please note that when you enter any subsites accessible through Extreme Websites, such subsites may have their own specific privacy policies. Additionally, the properties of affiliated Extreme companies, including some that are linked to/from the Extreme Websites, may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policies on those websites if you visit them.
With the exception of information related to establishing an account and login credentials for any of the Extreme Websites, Extreme does not generally require that you provide us with personal data in order to visit and use the Extreme Websites. Please note that in order to participate in some activities, such as sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) and social media, we may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, company name, title, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number). Extreme may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, which may include demographic information such as geographic region, etc., or certain information about your preferences and interests.

In the event that a Promotion is offered jointly with a third party, as a result of your participation in such Promotion, your personal data and non-personal data may be shared with such third party. This sharing will be disclosed to you at the time you provide your information. By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other third parties connected to the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising and marketing materials. Therefore, always carefully read the rules of the Promotion before entering.

In addition, if you are on another Website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that Website will forward to us your e-mail address and other (personal data) about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to use our services that we believe may be of interest to you.

Information related to your Device such as the platform, operating system, browser type, or physical location.
Your Usage Information such as the content served, the time at which the content was accessed and/or the time spent using the content, and the preceding content views.

1. To Affiliates, Other Extreme Companies and Third-Parties.
Extreme may share your personal data with companies affiliated with Extreme (“Affiliates”), so that those Affiliates can (i) assist us with fulfilling your requests or improving our content, services or advertising; and/or (ii) contact you about other content, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.
We may from time to time employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf, and thus, we may also share your personal data with third-party service providers that assist us with providing content, fulfilling your requests, improving our content, services or advertising, or otherwise performing services for Extreme. As one example, if you access content or services that are published, developed or supported by an Affiliate or third party, your personal data may be shared with that Affiliate or third party for purposes related to that content or those services, including service administration and/or development. Additionally, we may share your
information in order to host or operate the Extreme Websites, for data analysis purposes, and for the administration of Promotions, such as in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.
2. When You Consent to Have Your Personal Data Shared or Otherwise Request That We Share Your
Information.
We may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties, for example so you are able to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties. Additionally, you may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third- party application, that we share personal data about you with a third party, and we will typically do so in those circumstances. If you consent or request to receive communications from third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.
The provisions above apply to our sharing of personal data with Affiliates and third-party service providers. They do not cover use of personal data that those Affiliates and third-party service providers collect directly from you. Such use of personal data is covered by the relevant Affiliate’s and/or third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.
3. Business Transactions.
We may share your personal data with Affiliates for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes, including any corporate reorganization, restructuring or other corporate change. In addition, Extreme or any of its assets, including the Extreme Websites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal data is one of the key business assets in the transaction. In such a case, your personal data may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, Extreme reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal data, in connection with any activity and/or transaction described above
4. Legal Protections and Law Enforcement.
We may transfer and disclose information, including your personal data, (including Usage Information and Device Identifier (including IP address)), to third parties: (i) to comply with legal obligations; (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (iii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iv) to verify or enforce our Terms and Conditions or other applicable policies; (v) to respond to an emergency; or (vi) to otherwise protect the rights, property, safety or security of third parties, visitors to the Extreme Websites or the public.
