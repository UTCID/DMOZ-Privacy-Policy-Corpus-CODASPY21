Important Information
You should carefully read the following Terms and Conditions. Your use of DearDiary.Net confirms that you have read and accepted these Terms and Conditions.
Introduction
Our basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features such as extra storage, access to additional themes, access to additional plugins and other features. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes into your diary as possible and you are encouraged to express yourself freely, subject to the following limitations. You are responsible for the content of your diary. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your site or get linked to from your diary (things like spam, viruses, or hate content).
The following terms and conditions govern all use of the DearDiary.Net website and all content, services and products available at or through the website. The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, the DearDiary.Net Privacy Policy).

Spammers
Nobody reads terms, especially spammers, but this is at the top in the vain hope that spammers might just notice and take note.

DearDiary.Net have a number of volunteers who are monitoring for spam diaries, and yours will be removed very quickly. Save yourself the bother and go elsewhere.
