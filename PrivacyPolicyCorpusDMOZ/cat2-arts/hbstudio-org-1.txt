Privacy
Welcome to the HB Studio website. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Included below is our policy on how we handle any information we receive from you. You are not required to provide us with information in order to use this website. If you do not want us accessing and/or using your personal information as described herein, please do not provide us with any.
Policy Statement
HB Studio is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our site. The information summarized below explains to site users how we implement this protection in regard to information derived from this site.
Information Collection
We collect and save personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number and/or credit card number (collectively, “Personal Information”) that you provide to HB Studio in response to the forms on this site. We use your Personal Information only to communicate with people interested in HB Studio. We may from time to time distribute information to you through your email or mailing address on behalf of other similar organizations when we believe that you will find their information to be of interest.

Cookies
HB Studio employs “cookies” to provide better service to the visitors on this site.

HB Studio does not maintain copies of cookies on your site after you leave our site. Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that are exchanged between a web site and a user’s computer which enable a “session”, or “dialog” to be established between the two machines. With the session established, HB Studio is able to tailor its responses (i.e., identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The session is broken when our server does not receive further requests from your computer or you simply exit your browser. These cookies are normally deleted from a user’s computer when the user logs off the computer or the user exits the browser. In the event a cookie is found on your workstation, which was issued by the HB Studio server, you may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our site. You have the option of disabling cookies by accessing the tools provided to you in your Internet options. However, please note that you may not have full access to the website if you change your cookie settings to disable them.
Security
We are committed to using our best efforts to maintain the security of your Personal Information. When users submit Personal Information, the information is stored in a password-protected database on the HB Studio server. Where entry of a credit card account is required, that account information is only used to seek approval of the charge from your bank. [[Once the transaction is complete, no portion of the account information is retained or forwarded.]] The balance of the Personal Information is stored in our permanent records. Although we use our best efforts to protect the security of your Personal Information and our system, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, no transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of this and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit to or through our Website. Therefore, you assume that risk by using the Website.
