Collection Of Personal Information
As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information.
However, when you register to use a Shutterstock site and order products or services as a Shutterstock subscriber in order
to provide the services to you, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:
Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and
Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card;
Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type; and
Profile data, including your username and password, details about your purchases and the Content that you license from us.
If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:
Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address.
Shutterstock may verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will
be stored securely on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely for
the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored.
Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, content
focus, and information about your skill level process.
Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.
If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that
activity.
As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Shutterstock or third party subprocessors contracted by Shutterstock
may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its
services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet
Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site
and its services. Shutterstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better
understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information.
In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement
the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your
contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent
errors in our database. We may supplement the information that we collect directly from you with information stored in
third-party databases, such as demographic information or company information in order to make it more likely that any
marketing communications we send will be relevant and of interest to you. You may find a list of any third-party subprocessors
that we use to process information here.
When you download and use our Mobile Apps or Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use,
and operating system version. We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device
at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.
Updating Your Personal Information And Privacy Preferences
Upon request Shutterstock will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party,
any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at privacy@shutterstock.com.
You have the right to access and correct, or delete your Personal Information and privacy preferences at any time. You may
do so by contacting privacy@shutterstock.com.
How Your Personal Information Is Used

site for you and/or to determine your preferences.
In certain situations, Shutterstock may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities,
including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, avoid litigation, protect your safety or the safety
of others, investigate fraud, and/or respond to a government request. We may also disclose information about you if we
determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public
importance.
Information Sharing With Service Providers / Agents
Shutterstock uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the best
of our knowledge, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other
purpose.
We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the Personal
Information which is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we may share Personal
Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information
to the performance of services for Shutterstock. You may find a list of these third-party subprocessors here.
We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.

or as required to fulfill our legal obligations. If you wish to delete your account or request that we no longer use your

necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

The choice to opt out of such communications is also generally available during the sign-up

as applicable. In addition, we will still send you service-related announcements including, but not limited to, a registration
email, benefit notification emails, emails automatically triggered by actions you took on the Site and bill related notices.
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you wish not to receive
them, you have the option of deactivating your account.
If you use a Shutterstock mobile app, we may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any
events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn
them off at the device level.
Protection Of Your Personal Information
The Personal Information that you provide in connection with the use of the Site is protected in several ways.
Access by you to your account profile is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password
is encrypted. You should strive to use a strong, alpha-numeric password which you should not divulge to anyone.
Your Personal Information resides on secure servers that only selected Shutterstock personnel and contractors have access
to via password.
Your Personal Information is encrypted whenever it is transmitted to Shutterstock.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information
using transport layer security technology.
We strive to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However,
no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we take into account
the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology to use these
measures protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our Web Sites, you can send email to us at privacy@shutterstock.com.

The Site may automatically collect information as you browse, such as Internet Service Provider, browser type and version,
operating system and device type, average time spent on our site(s), pages viewed, information accessed, the Internet Protocol
(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet and other relevant statistics. Such information is sometimes
referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data.

services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and provide site functionality.

cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on the user’s computer
until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely.

aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store
within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. Where we use providers
based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.

by email or on the home page of the Site when we make material changes to this Privacy Policy prior to the change becoming
