Supplementary Planning Guidance
Local Development Plan 1

Guidance notes, briefs and other supplementary guidance act as stepping stones between the policies of the National Park and planning applications.
While only the policies in the Development Plan have special status in deciding planning applications (ie for the purpose of any determination under the Planning Acts, the determination must be made in accordance with the Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise), Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) may be taken into account as a material planning consideration.
In making decisions on matters that come before it, the Welsh Government and the Planning Inspectorate will give substantial weight to approved SPG which derives out of and has been prepared consistent with the approach set out in national policy on the preparation of Local Development Plans. Put simply, the requirements of the legislation mean that the following needs to be taken into account when considering a proposal:
Whether the proposal meets the requirements of policies within the Development Plan; and
Weigh up all the other planning considerations to see whether they outweigh the conclusion of the Development Plan (see page 21 of the WLGA’s Planning Handbook a Guide for Local Authority Members).
The following Supplementary Planning Guidance has been prepared following adoption of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Local Development Plan in September 2010

Erratum 25th June 2012
Figure 9.2 and 9.3  have been updated to address two drafting errors:  Figure 9.2 for medium scale turbines showed the Landscape Character Area No.26  as  “Moderate to High” sensitivity whereas the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance classes it as “High”.  Figure 9.3 for small scale turbines showed the Landscape Character Area No.26 classified  as “Moderate” sensitivity. The adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance classes it as “Moderate to High”. Both Figures now show the correct classification as per the adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance text.’
