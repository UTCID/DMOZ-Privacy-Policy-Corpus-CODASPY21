Students with Disabilities
The Conservatory attempts to make the MRP II Program accessible to all individuals, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The mission of the school is to train individuals for entry level positions in the audio industry.
The Conservatory strives to create a learning environment in which all people with disabilities:
Have equal access to courses, programs and services offered.
Have an equal opportunity to learn and receive reasonable accommodations and/or auxiliary services when applicable.
Have appropriate confidentiality of all information regarding their disability in line with the FERPA and Privacy Act policies.
For students with disabilities the Conservatory makes every effort to assist them in achieving these goals. Students with disabilities have the option of requesting special assistance, accommodations and/or auxiliary services if necessary. All requests will be reviewed by Administration to determine if the requested accommodations can be granted and specifically what the scope of the accommodations will include.
It is strongly recommended that prior to investing time and monetary resources; a prospective student with a known disability contacts their Admissions Representative and/or Director of Admissions to further discuss the potential for success in the audio industry.
Admissions requirements for all students are the same, regardless of disability or lack thereof. It must be understood that accommodations for disabilities are meant to assure education experience and opportunity. Any accommodations deemed necessary and reasonable will be made on a case-by-case basis, will not necessarily incorporate all changes requested and will only be made following provision of proof of such disability.
Procedure for Requesting Accommodations
Students seeking accommodations should notify their Admissions Representative or the Director of Admissions immediately of any special needs, requirements or requests before enrolling in a program of study.
To request accommodations, student must provide the following:
- Written description of the extent and nature of the disability.
- Current medical certification of disability from doctor or other appropriate professional.
- Written document stating any/all accommodations, auxiliary aids and/or services requested.
All required documentation must be received by the Conservatory no later than 45 days prior to student’s projected start date. Accommodations cannot be applied to circumstances of past failures or difficulties in courses and will only be applied to future course activities.
All documents will be reviewed and evaluated by Administration. A reply will be sent to the prospective student within 10 business days of receipt of all complete documentation defining which accommodations will or will not be allowed/granted. If the submitted information is inadequate to formulate a final decision, Administration reserves the right to request further information from prospective student in order to provide the most accurate and fair decision as possible.
Once the Administrator has issued the final decision:
- A document will be drafted specifically outlining the granted accommodations.
- Both student and Administrator will sign and date this document.
- The signed document will be placed in student’s permanent file.
- A copy of accommodation document will be given to the student.
- At the beginning of each new class (either new subject or new Instructor) student will be required to show accommodation document to their Instructor. This ensures that each Instructor has been fully informed of all specific accommodations accepted.
Projected Success in the Audio Industry
