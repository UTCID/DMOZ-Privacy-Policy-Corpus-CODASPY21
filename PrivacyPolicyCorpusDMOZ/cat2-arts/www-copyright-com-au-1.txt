Copyright Agency will not collect sensitive information about you unless you consent (we take your provision of the information to be consent to its collection), and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. If Copyright Agency holds any sensitive information about you, that information will only be used and disclosed by Copyright Agency for the purpose that it was provided by you.
