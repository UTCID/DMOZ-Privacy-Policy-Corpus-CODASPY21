DISCLAIMER
Totals, averages and rankings
The data this site comes from numerous sources. NationMaster has added additional features where totals, averages and nation rankings are calculated. These can be unreliable,
as each statistic may have been collected using differing methodologies and at different times. Further, some countries will not have data for a statistic. This does not
mean that they have none of the prescribed figure (eg. no airports, no people living with HIV, etc), or even that no measurement has been made. Thus, these should only be
construed as a rough guide.
The data may be unreliable in other ways not mentioned here.
