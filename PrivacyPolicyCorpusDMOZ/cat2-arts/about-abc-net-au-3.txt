The ABC provides its online services, including ABC-managed spaces on third party platforms, (ABC Online Services) on the following terms.
By continuing to access the ABC Online Services, you agree to be bound by the terms outlined below and any additional terms (including House Rules) outlined within the specific service you access. Please check this page regularly so you are aware of any updates to the terms. If you do not agree with any of the terms, as updated or amended, please do not use the service.
2. Contributing Content
You are responsible for all content you contribute to any ABC Online Services, including text, photos, videos, audio and links (Your Content).
By contributing content to any ABC Online Service, you grant the ABC a royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to use Your Content in any way that we want, and in any media worldwide. This may include the use of your photos or video on ABC television, transmission of the material by our overseas partners and syndication to our Australian content partners. You retain copyright and any other rights you hold in Your Content and can continue to share and commercialise Your Content as you wish.
You confirm you own or have the right to use any copyright material included in Your Content (including music, photos, quotes and excerpts of audio or video), that you have permission of anyone appearing or performing in Your Content and that you are not infringing any person’s rights by submitting the content to the ABC. You also confirm you have, where appropriate, sought the consent of the parent or guardian of any person under the age of 18 who is featured in Your Content.
Please ensure you keep your own copies of Your Content as the ABC may not archive, store or back-up Your Content nor continue to make Your Content accessible online.
The ABC will endeavour to provide you with an appropriate credit when using Your Content on ABC platforms, though you understand and agree this may not always be possible.
3. ABC Online Communities
While encouraging rigorous debate and the sharing of diverse opinions, the ABC expects community members to treat each other with respect and courtesy. These standards apply to interaction within all ABC Online Services including official ABC accounts established on third-party social media sites.
You understand and agree the ABC has ultimate editorial control over all its online services. The ABC may edit, remove or exercise its discretion not to publish your contribution for legal, editorial or operational reasons including if the ABC considers it to be:
defamatory, or otherwise unlawful or that it violates laws regarding harassment, discrimination, racial vilification, privacy or contempt;
intentionally false or misleading;
an infringement of intellectual property rights including copyright;
abusive, offensive or obscene;
inappropriate, off topic, repetitive or vexatious. For example the ABC reserves the right to reject contributions that have been widely canvassed in the forum. It also reserves the right to reject contributions from participants who seek to dominate the discussion;
compromising the privacy of any person or containing inappropriate personal information;
seeking to endorse commercial products or services;
seeking to directly solicit donations;
deliberate provocation of other community members; or
impersonating someone else and/or posting on behalf of a suspended member.
If you breach these Terms of Use, the ABC may block your account or contributions.
The ABC values the role of its communities in guiding content standards and etiquette among members. If you have concerns about inappropriate content on an ABC Online Service you can alert the moderator of that space.
When accessing or participating in an ABC-managed space on a third party platform, such as channels, pages or feeds hosted on an external site, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions specified by that third party platform.
The ABC recommends you make sure you understand the privacy settings for each platform with which you engage and choose appropriate options to protect your personal details and content shared.

5. Children

When contributions are sought from, likely to have been submitted by, or include children and/or young people (under 18), the ABC will, where appropriate, seek the consent of a child’s parent or guardian before using a child’s contribution on ABC platforms.
Parents seeking appropriate content for young children and advice regarding information regarding online safety can find the ABC’s children’s online destinations at www.abc.net.au/children/.
