Your Privacy Matters
As an author, I'm very sensitive to matters of copyright and privacy. That's why I want you to know that I don't collect any information on you from this site. The box to sign up for my alert on new books issued as well as the link to The Regency Reader, a publication of the Regency Special Interest Chapter of Romance Writers of America, will take you to a distributor (MailerLite for me, MailChimp for the Reader), where the newsletters are issued. These distributors collect some information on you to e-mail information. None of us shares that information with others for any reason.
The links to buy my books will take you to various online retailers. Should you decide to buy books there, they will collect some information about you, but I don't see any of that. Following the links from my site to theirs, however, may increase my income. I'm a member of several affiliate programs, which means the retailer pays me a percentage of what you spend to thank me for referring you. For example, as an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. You never have to follow the links; you don't have to buy anything. But I'll always try to include links that save you money and make it easy for you to buy one of my books, if you're interested.
And if you do decide to follow one of the links and buy something, thank you! You're helping keep a writer doing what she was called to do: write. Bless you!!
