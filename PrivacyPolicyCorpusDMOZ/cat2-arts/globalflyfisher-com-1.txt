Ever so often I get a mail asking if I would like to have guest posts on the Global FlyFisher. I have turned down every offer until now and here's why.

What's the first letter in the word spammer?
Yes, this is a trick question and easy to answer.We ask it because spam bots are too stupid to answer correctly, while humans are not.

Since you got this far …
The GFF money box
… I have a small favor to ask.
Long story short
Support the Global FlyFisher through several different channels, including PayPal.
Long story longer
The Global FlyFisher has been online since the mid-90's and has been free to access for everybody since day one – and will stay free for as long as I run it.
But that doesn't mean that it's free to run.
It costs money to drive a large site like this.
