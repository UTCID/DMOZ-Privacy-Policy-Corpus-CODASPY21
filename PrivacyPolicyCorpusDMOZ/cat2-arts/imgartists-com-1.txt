DATA PROCESSING PROVISIONS
For the purpose of Data Processing the parties agree that the following provisions shall apply as between (i) IMG Artists and (ii) each contractor, supplier, consultant, distributor or any other party (collectively ‘Contractors’) contracting with IMG Artists (‘an IMG Artists Contract’). In so far as required, each party agrees that it will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This Schedule is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party’s obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.
The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, the Contractor is the data controller and IMG Artists is the data processor (where Data Controller and Data Processor have the meanings as defined in the Data Protection Legislation).
Without prejudice to the generality of clause 1 of this Schedule, the Contractor will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the Personal Data to IMG Artists for the duration and purposes of the IMG Artists Contract.
Without prejudice to the generality of clause 1 of this Schedule, IMG Artists warrants and undertakes that it shall, in relation to any Personal Data processed in connection with the performance by IMG Artists of its obligations under the IMG Artists Contract:
process that Personal Data only on the instructions of the Contractor unless IMG Artists is required by the laws of any member of the European Union or by the laws of the European Union applicable to IMG Artists to process Personal Data (Applicable Laws). Where IMG Artists is relying on laws of a member of the European Union or European Union law as the basis for processing Personal Data, IMG Artists shall promptly notify the Contractor of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws unless those Applicable Laws prohibit IMG Artists from so notifying the Contractor;
ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures, to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate, pseudonymising and encrypting Personal Data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services, ensuring that availability of and access to Personal Data can be restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures adopted by it);
ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Personal Data are obliged to keep the Personal Data confidential;
not transfer any Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area unless the prior written consent of the Contractor has been obtained and the following conditions are fulfilled:
the Contractor or IMG Artists has provided appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer;
the data subject has enforceable rights and effective legal remedies;
IMG Artists complies with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any Personal Data that is transferred; and
IMG Artists complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in advance by the Contractor with respect to the processing of the Personal Data;
assist the Contractor, at the Contractor’s cost, in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;
notify the Contractor without undue delay on becoming aware of a Personal Data breach;
at the written direction of the Contractor, delete or return Personal Data and copies thereof to the Contractor on termination of the IMG Artists Contract unless required by Applicable Law to store the Personal Data; and
maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this Schedule 3 (and allow for audits by the Contractor or the Contractor’s designated auditor).
The Contractor consents to IMG Artists appointing the current third-party processors of Personal Data, including IT, legal and financial processors, and any other additional third-party processors appointed by IMG Artists from time to time, provided that IMG Artists will give to the Contractor a prior written [30] days’ notice to advise of any such additional third-party processors and the Contractor does not object to the appointment of any such additional third-party processors during the [30] days’ notice period. [Should the Contractor object in writing to any such additional third-party processors being appointed by IMG Artists, it will have the right to terminate the IMG Artists Contract upon giving IMG Artists at least 30 days’ prior written notice, which shall be the Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy if the Contractor objects to any new third-party processor.] IMG Artists confirms that it has entered or (as the case may be) will enter with each of the third-party processors into a written agreement substantially on that third party’s standard terms of business incorporating terms which are substantially similar to those set out in these provisions. As between the Contractor and IMG Artists, IMG Artists shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any third-party processor appointed by it pursuant to these provisions.
The parties may by mutual agreement revise these provisions by replacing it with any applicable controller to processor standard clauses or similar terms forming party of an applicable certification scheme.
The Contractor agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified IMG Artists and defend it at its own expense against all costs, claims, damages or expenses incurred by IMG Artists or for which IMG Artists may become liable due to any failure by the Contractor or its employees or agents, if any, to comply with any of the Contractor’s obligations under these provisions.
The Contractor shall own all right, title and interest in and to all of the Personal Data that it passes to IMG Artists under the IMG Artists Contract and this Schedule, and shall have sole responsibility for its legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy and quality.
IMG Artists may only process personal data on behalf of the Contractor within the scope and purpose of providing IMG Artists Services under the IMG Artists Contract with the Contractor.
The duration of the processing activities shall be for as long as it is necessary for IMG Artists to comply with its Services under the IMG Artists Contract, and shall cease upon any termination or expiry of the IMG Artists Contract.
