This is done with a secret code or what’s called a ‘cypher’. The hidden information is said to then be ‘encrypted’Pseudonymisation, meaning that we’ll use a different name, so we can hide parts of your personal information from view. This means that someone outside of the Council could work on your information for us without ever knowing it was yoursControlling access to systems and networks allows us to stop people who are not allowed to view your personal information from getting access to itControlling access to the building and to the filing cabinetsTraining for our staff allows us to make them aware of how to handle information and how and when to report when something goes wrongRegular testing of our technology and ways of working including keeping up to date on the latest security updates (commonly called patches). Where Can I get advice?If you have any worries or questions about how your personal information is handled, please contact our Data Protection Officer at Email: dpo@cavancoco.ie or Tel: 049-4378300You can also get advice on data protection from the Data Protection Commissioner at:info@dataprotection.ie  or https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Home/4.htm  or http://gdprandyou.ie/ Right of Complaint to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner:If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the response you received from Cavan County Council in relation to your request, then you are entitled to make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner in writing who may investigate the matter for you.The Data Protection Commissioner’s website is www.dataprotection.ieYou can contact their office at: Lo Call Number: 1890 252 231 E-mail: info@dataprotection.iePostal Address: Data Protection Commissioner Canal House Station Road Portarlington Co.
