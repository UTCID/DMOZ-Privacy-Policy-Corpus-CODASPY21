Privacy Policy
Information Collection, Use, and Sharing.
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct form of contact. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, for example, to ship an order or mail you a catalog.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about calligraphy or book arts events, specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. Unless you ask us not to, we may mail printed catalogs to you in the future.
Emails
When you place an order on the website, the site automatically sends an order confirmation email, and when your order ships we will send you a shipping confirmation email. If you subscribe to one of our magazines, we will send you email reminders (and/or postcards) when it is time to renew that subscription. These emails are sent out even if you have opted out of marketing/promotional emails.
Orders
We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.
Envelopes
If you send a decorated/calligraphed envelope to us, we may post it on social media. Any return address will be removed before the envelope is posted to the web.
Cookies
We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.
Sharing
We use two outside printing companies to print and mail catalogs to customers and potential customers and print and mail magazines to subscribers and, occasionally, to non-subscriber customers. We provide these companies mailing addresses each time a new publication is printed and mailed. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond mailing the publications.

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
