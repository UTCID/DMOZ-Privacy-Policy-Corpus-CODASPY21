Privacy Policy
We pledge that we will not sell, rent, or give away your information to any bulk e-mail lists or the like. Visitors to this site and other members who are listed on this site will have access to the public e-mail addresses and web site addresses given to us through the public section of the site only. Venue location information will also be available through the public site (so fans can find your place, duh!).
Further, we pledge that we will not fill your inbox with junk e-mails (we hate them too). The only time you will be
contacted by us in a bulk e-mail is when there is a major change to the site or the business behind the site.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
If this policy changes at any time you will be notified and you will have the option of changing your notification
preferences.
Thank you for your interest and support.
