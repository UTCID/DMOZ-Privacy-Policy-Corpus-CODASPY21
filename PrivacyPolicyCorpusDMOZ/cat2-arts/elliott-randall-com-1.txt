Elliott Randall here. This notice is to inform you that this site is wholly owned and overseen by me. I personally guarantee you that I will not give, lend, sell or in any way transfer any email address you send me for my mailing list, or in any other communication we have.
I am myself, a victim of spammers. I receive approximately 1,000 pieces of junk mail a week, as a result of my primary email address being all over the ‘net – newsgroups etc. My reputation as an honest business person both on the ‘net and within the music industry is easily verified.
So there you have it – my personal guarantee.
Incidentally, if you wish to eradicate spam in your e-life, you might try SpamArrest (30 day free trial).
I swear by it!
