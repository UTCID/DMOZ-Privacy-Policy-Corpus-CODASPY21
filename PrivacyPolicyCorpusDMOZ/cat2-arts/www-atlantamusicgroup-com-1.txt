Thank you for visiting
http://www.atlantamusicgroup.com (our "Site").
We appreciate the opportunity to interact with you on
the Internet and are committed to protecting and
safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy
Statement is to inform you about the types of
information we might collect about you when you visit
our Site, how we may use that information and whether
we disclose that information to anyone.
What Information We Collect and How We Use
It
Any information we collect on our Site generally falls
into the Personally Identifiable Information category.
Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to
information that lets us know specifically who you are.
In general, you can visit our Site without telling us
who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable
Information.
Ordering - When you place an order for
products or services, we collect Personally
Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and
billing information, credit card, and other transaction
information). We use this information to deliver your
order, process payment, and to communicate with you
about the status of your order. Credit card information
submitted with your order is used only for payment
processing and is not retained on our Site. You may
request your purchase be shipped by common carrier, in
which case certain information will be shared with the
respective carrier for delivery purposes.
Sharing Your Information
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do
not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any
Personally Identifiable Information we collect online
unless we have your permission. Any Personally
Identifiable Information you provide to us will be used
for your purchases and retained in hard copy form of
the original invoice as well as within our database
system, which generates our invoices.
From time to time, we may be required to provide
Personally Identifiable Information in response to
court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We
also reserve the right to report to law enforcement
agencies any activities that we in good faith believe
to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable
Information when we believe that such release is
reasonably necessary to enforce and to protect the
rights, property, and safety of others and
ourselves.

Links to third-party Web sites may be provided solely
for your information and convenience, or to provide
additional information for various other goods and
services. If you use these links, you will leave our
Site. This Privacy Statement does not cover the
information practices of those Web sites linked to our
Site, nor do we control their content or privacy
policies. We suggest that you carefully review the
privacy policies of each site you visit.

Any updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy
Statement will be posted here on our Site and the date
of the newest version posted below. Please check back
frequently, especially before you submit any Personally
Identifiable Information at our Site, to see if this
Privacy Statement has changed.

Privacy Statement in effect at the time of use.
