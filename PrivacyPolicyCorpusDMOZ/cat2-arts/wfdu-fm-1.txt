Latest from WFDU General Manager, Kenny O'Boyle
Hello everyone!
I hope you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and managing okay during these unprecedented times.
I wanted to give you all an update, but unfortunately there is not much to update you on. The question I get more than any other from our staff and listeners is, “When will WFDU be able to resume normal, live programming?” Unfortunately, I do not have an answer to this question. Logically, I would have to assume that WFDU Staff will not be allowed back inside the station until the government stay at home restrictions are lifted. Who knows when that will be? Even when those restrictions are lifted, it’s still ultimately up to the university.
What can we do and what are we doing?
We can stay on the air and streaming
We can keep the RetroRadio Oldies coming Monday through Friday on HD1
We can broadcast recorded messages from our RetroRadio hosts and we are experimenting with ways to broadcast live remotely and even take listener requests (stay tuned)
HD1 weekend shows have been submitting new material and recordings of past shows and they have been airing consistently
We are now accepting new material and recordings of past shows for our programs on HD2 and will begin airing those ASAP
I speak on behalf of the entire staff and I’m sure many of you too when I say we all can’t wait to return to normal. We all miss doing our shows and most of all, interacting with you! Please be patient. We all have to be.
I very much appreciate all of the listeners that have reached out via email, phone or Facebook. Overwhelmingly, the messages are positive and appreciative that WFDU is still on the air even in this limited capacity. It warms my heart to hear that WFDU can be a source of comfort during all of this.
If you would like to reach out with any comments, questions or concerns, please do.

Keep listening and thanks for supporting WFDU!
