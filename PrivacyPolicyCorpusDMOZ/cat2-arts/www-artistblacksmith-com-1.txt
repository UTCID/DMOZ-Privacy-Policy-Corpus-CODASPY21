Privacy Policy
for
David Robertson Artist Blacksmith
www.artistblacksmith.com
and
The Hammer
and Tongs
As of Jan. 1 , 2004 The Canadian government has
required all
businesses to develop
a privacy of information policy. This document is in
response to that
policy, and
outlines how I treat the information that you provide
me.
Consent:
I generally
assume that if you provide me with contact information
(address,
telephone, email,
etc.) that this is giving me consent to use this
information to contact
you. I do
not sell or trade contact information of individuals,
but will refer
businesses.
Financial
Info:
Credit card information is not stored on the computer
but is kept
separate
in a locked filling cabinet. Due to the recent increase
in costs
associated with
Visa, credit card transactions will be processed on the
day of shipping
not 30 days
later for wholesale customers. Pay Pal is now another
option available.
Contact
Info:
If you are an individual I generally do not pass on your
contact
information. If you are a business I will refer your
business to people
looking for a specific
product or service, either in writing, email or
conversation. It
becomes the person's
responsibility to look your business up for further
contact.
Students:
Occaisionally
while teaching a course I will photograph the students
for the purpose
of advertising. This may mean that your picture could be
published on
the web. In these pictures
I may use first name identifiers. I will upon occaission
use the
information that you have
provided me to send you course updates, or notification
of up coming
events, or specfic
pieces of information. If you do not wish this form of
contact it is
your responsibility
to inform me and I will remove you from my mailing list.
Links:
Many of the links on the website will lead to sponsor
websites.
In part I am able to keep this website running
from purchases
from other websites that yeild a commision to me. This
helps support my
costs as I am in business.
Membership
If you sign up to be a member of my website I will send
you emailed
information about blacksmithing and related topics. Some
of this
information may be sales related and may contain links
to my products
or other people's products that I make a commision on
referals.
These payments help defer the costs of providing
ongoing
information to you about blacksmithing and metal work in
general. You
may unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link at the
bottom of the
emails sent to you or by contacting me directly.
I, David Robertson
am the Privacy Officer for the Hammer and Tongs and www.artistblacksmith.com.
If you need,  you may contact
me if you have questions about this policy.
