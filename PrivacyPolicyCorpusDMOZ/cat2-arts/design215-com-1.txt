last modified September 2, 2018
Design215.com Online Privacy Policy
This document sets forth the Design215 Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for this
Web site, www.Design215.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy,
you should not access or use this Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy
practices associated with offline activities or other Design215 Inc. web sites.
Collection of personal information
Personal information on this Site is only collected by Design215 Inc.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us by email or letter.
Design215 will not send you any email regarding other products, services, or special
offers, although we may communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this
Site. Design215 will not provide your personal information to other companies or
organizations without your consent.
How personal information is used
Design215 collects your information in order to record and support your participation in
the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service, the information is used to
register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made
available to registered users.
Design215 may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of
services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected without
identifying any user individually. Design215 may use this non-identifying statistical
data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
Service announcements
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.
For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send
all registered users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications,
but they are not promotional in nature.
Legal Responsibility
Design215 may provide your personal information if necessary, in Design215's good faith
judgement, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or
in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights of Design215
or others.
Protection of your personal information
The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a
user of Design215 products or services is classified as Registration Information.
Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your
Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID
selected by you. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online,
for example in a chat room, that information can be collected and used by others. In
short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may
receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Links to other sites
This Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Design215 is not
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to
be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and
every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
Use of cookies
When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important information
without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we may use "cookies" to
track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser
by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as
your identification card, and enables Design215 to record your passwords, purchases, and
preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify
you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.
(For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users
choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior
visits to this website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and
its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other
sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting
Ads Settings.
Log files
In addition to standard server log files, this site generates its own log
files. These log files provide usernames, date/time stamp, internet protocol (IP)
addresses, browser type, platform type, and other statistical information. None of the
information in Design215maps log files is linked to personally identifiable information.
Changes in privacy policy
All "personal information" ("personal information" is defined as any information that
identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such
information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the
Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. Design215 reserves the right to
change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will provide
notice of material changes on the homepage of the Site for thirty (30) days.
Business transitions
In the event Design215 is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Design215 may
provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of the
business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.
