How we Use Personally Identifiable Information
KING FM may ask for your personally identifiable information (like your name, address, email address, phone number or credit card information) but will never disclose any of this information to a non-affiliated third party without first receiving your permission (unless required by law). This means, e.g., we may email you to join a newsletter list or ask you to renew your membership when it expires, and we may share your information with third party service providers, but only for the purpose of helping us do these sorts of things and never for their own use. These third party service providers maintain customer databases with email addresses obtained via the KING FM platform and other collection methods (events, phone calls, etc.) and visitors who have provided them to us by registering on our site, signing up for a newsletter or email, emailing questions about services or donors who submit online contributions. These third party vendors are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control and can only use the information on our behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for example sending you a letter in the mail.. They are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose.
Payment Information
When you provide us with payment information in order to process a donation, this information is encrypted, using reasonable, industry-standard security measures, and is used (generally by our third party vendors) only to fulfill your transaction.
