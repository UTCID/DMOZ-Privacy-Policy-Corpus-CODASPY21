We expect that our team will be able to resolve any issues you may have as you enjoy our products and services. In the unlikely event that an issue between us remains unresolved, please note that THESE TERMS REQUIRE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. ALSO, THESE TERMS SET FORTH SPECIFIC REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU. PLEASE SEE SECTION 14 TO LEARN MORE.
1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS.
Taunton provides high-quality, high-value information to special-interest enthusiasts as well as venues for a healthy and open exchange of information, opinions, and comments for all participants, in addition to print and online publications and products (the “Services”). Some of the Services do not require payment, while others require payment before you can access them (“Fee-Based Services”). Our Fee-Based Services include online memberships as well as print subscriptions and bundles. In connection with the Services, Taunton operates several websites, including but not limited to FineGardening.com, FineHomebuilding.com, FineWoodworking.com, Threads.com, and GreenBuildingAdvisor.com, (collectively referred to herein as the “Sites”).
Use of the Services and the Sites is subject to compliance with these Terms which incorporate by reference our Privacy Policy available at https://www.taunton.com/privacy-policy/ (“Privacy Policy”). Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below (collectively, the “Agreement”). Therefore, by accessing or using any of the Services or the Sites, you accept and agree to the Agreement.  If you do not agree with the Agreement, you may not use any of the Services or the Sites.
2. Registration.
Registration may be required to use or access certain Services, and/or certain features offered on the Sites. When registering an account for the Services or the Sites (“Account”), you must create a screen name and a password and provide only true, accurate, current, and complete information requested by the registration form (the “Registration Data”), and promptly update the Registration Data thereafter as necessary.

3. PAYMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS.
3.1 Billing. You may purchase a Fee-Based Service by (1) paying a subscription or membership fee in advance on a monthly basis (every 30 days) or annual basis, which is disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”). You agree that you are financially responsible for your Fee-Based Services, and to the extent applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges for your Fee-Based Services in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You also agree to pay all applicable taxes. You must provide Taunton with valid payment information in connection with your Fee-Based Services. By providing Taunton with your payment information, you agree that (i) Taunton is authorized to charge you for all fees due and payable to Taunton under your Account, and (ii) Taunton is authorized to share any payment information and instructions required to complete the payment transactions with its third-party payment service providers (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). You further agree to immediately notify Taunton of any change in your payment information. In the event Taunton cannot charge your payment method, we will give you notice that your payment method is expired or otherwise not accepting the charge and ask that you update your payment information. If you do not provide us with a valid payment method, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Fee-Based Services.
3.2 Changes to Pricing. Taunton reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, with advance notice to you. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling the Fee-Based Services prior to the price change going into effect.
3.3 Automatic Renewal and Cancellation. If you purchased a Fee Based Service that is subject to automatic renewal (“Auto-Renewal Service”), your Auto-Renewal Service will automatically renew for the term length you chose and we will automatically bill your payment method before the start of each new term until you cancel your Auto-Renewal Service or we terminate it. You must cancel your Auto-Renewal Service at least three (3) days in advance before it renews in order to avoid billing of the fee for the next billing period. You may cancel your Account (if you created one), your Fee-Based Service, and/or your Auto-Renewal Service (1) by clicking here for Customer Support; (2) calling customer service Monday – Friday 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time at (800) 943-0291 for U.S. and Canada, or +1 (515) 247-2990 for all other international calls; or (3) sending an email to customerservice@Taunton.com. If you cancel your Auto-Renewal Service that renews on an annual basis, Taunton will refund the remainder of your paid annual fee on a pro-rata basis, which will cover the unused months of your Auto-Renewal Service. If you cancel your Auto-Renewal Service that renews on a monthly basis, no new charges will be made. Taunton does not refund for partial months.
3.4 Miscellaneous Charges. In addition to the charges set forth above, you are responsible for all charges associated with connecting to the Sites, including without limitation all telephone access lines (including long-distance charges, when applicable), telephone and computer equipment and any service fees necessary to access the Fee-Based Services.

If it is determined that you retain moral rights (including rights of attribution or integrity) in the User Content, you forever waive and agree to not claim or assert any entitlement to any and all moral rights of an author in any of the User Content. You represent and warrant to Taunton that you have the full legal right and authority to grant to Taunton the license provided for herein, that you own or control the complete rights to the User Content you submitted, and that neither the User Content nor the exercise of the rights granted herein shall violate these Terms of Use or infringe upon any rights, including the right of privacy or right of publicity, constitute a libel or slander against, or violate any common law or any other right of, or cause injury to, any person or entity.

It’s just as important to consider that this is a community with many opinions and preferences, so if you do not agree with another user’s post, by all means debate, but do not attack.

This prohibition includes sending unsolicited mass mailings from another Internet service, which in any way involves the use of the Sites or any equipment owned or operated by Taunton in connection with the Sites. A message is unsolicited if it is posted in violation of a USENET or newsgroup charter and/or if it is sent to a recipient who has not requested or invited the message. For purposes of this provision, merely making one’s e-mail address accessible to the public shall not constitute a request or invitation to receive messages.

Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Taunton of any third-party site or any materials contained therein.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES, SITES, CONTENT, THESE TERMS, OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE RELEVANT EVENT. A DISPUTE IS COMMENCED IF IT IS FILED IN AN ARBITRATION OR, IF THE DISPUTE IS NON-ARBITRABLE, A COURT WITH JURISDICTION, DURING THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD. IF YOU OR WE PROVIDE NOTICE OF A DISPUTE UNDER SECTION 14 (ARBITRATION AGREEMENT), THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD IS TOLLED FOR 60 DAYS FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE OF DISPUTE. YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY THAT IS NOT FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AND ANY RIGHT YOU OR WE MAY HAVE HAD TO PURSUE THAT DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY IN ANY FORUM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
14. CHOICE OF LAW, MANDATORY ARBITRATION, AND VENUE.
14.1. Governing Law/Jurisdiction. The Agreement (and any non-contractual disputes and/or claims arising out of or in connection with it) is subject to the laws of the state of Connecticut, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Taunton agree to the jurisdiction of a state or federal court in the state of Connecticut to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreement (and any non-contractual disputes and/or claims relating to or arising in connection with it) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 14.2.1.
14.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
14.2.1 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. You and Taunton agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim between us arising out of or relating in any way to any of Taunton’s offerings, Services, Sites, Content, or software will be resolved by binding individual (not class) arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act and Federal Arbitration Law shall apply to this Agreement.
You and Taunton further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
If either party files a court proceeding in violation of this provision, he/she/it agrees to be responsible to pay any costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, that are incurred by the other party in enforcing these dispute resolution provisions.
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT.
14.2.2 Exceptions.  Notwithstanding the provision above (14.2), you and Taunton both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court, or (2) bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including with respect to temporary restraining orders.
14.2.3 No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver. YOU AND TAUNTON AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Taunton agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
14.2.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or USPS express mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Taunton’s address for notice is: Taunton, Inc. Attention: Legal Department, 63 South Main Street, Newtown, CT 06470 USA. The notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
14.2.5 Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes. You also agree to delegate the issue of arbitrability to an arbitrator. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. Taunton will reimburse those fees up to $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Taunton will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. There will be only one arbitrator, not a panel. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person at an AAA forum in Connecticut.
14.2.6 Enforceability. If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 14.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreement.
15. TERMINATION.
In addition to any other rights of the parties set forth herein, either you or Taunton may terminate this Agreement at any time by cancelling your Account or Services, except that the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14 of this Agreement is severable from and shall survive termination. Taunton also reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to any of the Fee-Based Services in whole or in part, without notice, due to any breach or threatened breach by you of any portion of this Agreement.
16. MODIFICATIONS.
16.1 To the Terms.  Taunton may make changes to these Terms from time to time.  You should look at these Terms regularly, which are posted on each of the Sites. If we make a material change to these Terms, we will notify you by posting a notice on each of the Sites. If you are a registered user, we will also send an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to the material change taking effect. Any material change to these Terms will be effective automatically 30 days after the revised Terms are first posted or, for users who register or otherwise provide opt-in consent during this 30-day period, at the time of registration or consent, as applicable.
16.2 To the Sites.  Taunton has the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services and the Sites or any portion thereof at any time, including the availability of any area of the Sites, including without limitation the Fee-Based Services. Taunton may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Sites without notice or liability.
17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Taunton, the Agreement constitutes all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Taunton and supersedes any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of the Agreement, whether written or oral.
18. SEVERABILITY.
These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
