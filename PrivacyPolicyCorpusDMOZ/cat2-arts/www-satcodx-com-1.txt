In this document we will inform you about the processing of personal data in connection with the services we offer at www.satbeams.com as well as our desktop/mobile applications and other branded tools (collectively referred to as “Platforms”). Personal data comprises all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (Article 4 (1) GDPR). This includes information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, postal address or coordinates.

3. Purposes and legal basis of the data processing and period for which data will be stored
In the following we inform you about the different purposes for which we process personal data, on which legal basis such processing takes place, and for how long we store the data.
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6 (1) (a) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the legal basis for the processing of personal data. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR will be the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions. If processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to, Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR is the legal basis for processing.
The personal data of the data subject will be stored for as long as the purpose continues.
3.1 Data processing in the context of a general use of our Platforms and services
3.1.1 General access to our Platforms
With each access to our Platforms, we automatically collect data and information from the accessing device and store this data and information in the log files of the server. We may collect the browser types and versions used, the operating system used by the accessing system, the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (known as referrers), the sub-web pages that are accessed on our website, the date and time of access to the website, an Internet protocol address (IP address), the Internet service provider of the accessing system and other similar data and information used for detecting and preventing fraud and unauthorized access and maintaining the security of your systems.
For security purposes, i.e. to be able to reconstruct an eventual attack against our Platforms, we store such data including the IP address for 30 days and then anonymize or delete such data. The IP address is required during the connection to transfer the contents of our Platform to your device. The legal basis for the processing and storage of the IP address is a legitimate interest as per Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest for the transmission of the IP address is that it is required to display the contents of the website; without transmission of the IP address it is not possible to display the content of the Platform. The legitimate interest for the temporary storage are our security interests.
3.1.2 Optimization of search and recommendation functions
We may also store information about your usage patterns on our Platforms in order to create statistical models to make our Platforms more user-friendly and, in particular, to optimize the functionalities to search for and recommend suitable job advertisements. In this context we also save your IP address in a pseudonymized form (that means that a natural person can no longer be identified based purely on the information in the statistical model) to exclude automated accesses (bots) to our Platforms when creating the statistical models. Legal basis for this purpose is Art. 6 (1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to ensure the functionality of the statistical model to improve our services. The IP address is deleted after one year.
3.1.3 Objections to marketing
If you raise an objection with us against marketing purposes, we may put your personal contact information on a blacklist to ensure that we no longer send you any unwanted marketing material. The legal basis is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, where the legitimate interest is that we can meet our obligations from your objection against marketing. The data will be stored for this purpose until you expressly withdraw the objection to marketing in writing.
3.1.4 Contact form and e-mail contact
Our Platforms provide contact forms that can be used to contact us electronically. By clicking the “Send” button, you consent to the transmission to us of the data entered in the input form. In addition, we save the date and time of your contact. Alternatively, contact via the e-mail address provided is possible. In this case, the user’s personal data transmitted along with e-mail and our response will be stored. The personal data voluntarily transmitted to us in this context is used to process your inquiry and to contact you as needed. The legal basis for the transmission of the data is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The data will be used for this purpose until the specific conversation with you has ended. The conversation will be deemed ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.

We use data processors, which we list below, to provide our services. The legal basis for using these data processors is legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

In exceptional cases, e.g. if needed to resolve technical issues LeaseWeb Netherlands B.V. may consequently also have access to your personal data but should not copy and store it outside of our Platforms.

We use CacheNetworks LLC, 111 W. Jackson Blvd., Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60604, USA as data processor for the purposes of proxy caching of some of our Platforms code and content.
