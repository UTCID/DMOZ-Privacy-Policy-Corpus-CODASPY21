VOIP Telephone Terms and Conditions
You are here:Home » VOIP Telephone Terms and Conditions
ALL TELEPHONE SERVICES
The terms and conditions of this Service Agreement (“Terms” or “Agreement”) constitute the agreement (“Agreement”) between SUCCEED.NET (“Company”, “We”, “Us”) and the User (“you,” “User” or “Customer”) of the Company’s residential and small business communications Services, and any related products or services (“Service”). This Agreement governs both the Service and the Analog Telephone Adapter or any other IP connection Device (“Device” or “Equipment”), used in conjunction with the Service.
BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT INCLUDES MANY IMPORTANT TERMS, INCLUDING: WARNINGS THAT YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO USE THE VOIP SERVICE FOR 911 OR OTHER EMERGENCY CALLS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES; LIMITS AND DISCLAIMERS ON COMPANY’S LIABILITY; AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU COMMIT TO A MINIMUM TERM OF SERVICE.
SERVICE
Service is offered on a monthly basis for a term that corresponds with the date your SUCCEED.NET Telephone service was activated and ends on the day before the same date in the following month. Subsequent terms of this Agreement automatically renew unless you give SUCCEED.NET written notice of non-renewal at least ten (10) days before the end of the monthly term in which the notice is given. You are purchasing the Service for full monthly terms, meaning that if you attempt to terminate Service prior to the end of a monthly term, you will be responsible for the full month’s charges to the end of the then-current term, including, without limitation, unbilled charges, plus a termination fee, if applicable, all of which will immediately become due and payable. Expiration of the term or termination of Service will not excuse you from paying all accrued and unpaid charges due under this Agreement.
If you subscribe to the Company’s Residential Services, which is defined as Service intended solely for the subscriber’s residence, or home, and not for commercial purposes (“Residential Services”), the Service and the Device are provided to you solely for such residential use. You shall not resell or transfer the Service or the Device to another party. You are prohibited from using the Service or the Device for auto-dialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, telemarketing (including, without limitation, charitable or political solicitation or polling), fax or voicemail broadcasting or fax or voicemail blasting. We reserve the right to immediately terminate or modify your Service if We determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that your use of the Service or the Device is, or at any time was, inconsistent with normal residential usage patterns. In addition, you will be required to pay our higher rates for commercial Service for all periods in which your use of the Service or the Device was inconsistent with normal residential use.
If you subscribe to the Company’s Business Services, which is defined as Service intended solely for the subscriber’s use to support commercial, for-profit or not-for-profit, non-residential enterprises (“Business Services”), the Service and Device are provided to you as a small business User. Because We have no control over your power or Internet connectivity you may experience occasional outages. For this reason We recommend that you maintain another backup provider so that you have backup contact ability. It is recommended that set a forward number that can be configured and enabled in the website https://myvoice.succeed.net so that you can receive calls in the event of an outage. You shall not resell or transfer the Service or the Device to another party. You are prohibited from using the Service or the Device for auto-dialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, telemarketing (including, without limitation, charitable or political solicitation or polling), fax or voicemail broadcasting or fax or voicemail blasting. We reserve the right to immediately terminate or modify your Service if We determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that you have at any time used the Service or the Device for any of the aforementioned or similar activities.
If your usage pattern for calls to the forty-eight (48) contiguous state local calling areas is in the ninety-fifth (95th) percentile for two months out of any three month period your account will automatically convert from an unlimited domestic long distance account to a metered use account. A metered use account will have a domestic long distance use allowance of 1500 minutes per user or per line, and additional domestic use for calls to the 48 contiguous state local calling areas will be billed at the then in effect domestic long distance rate, currently $.03 per minute.
LIMITATIONS OF SERVICE
Customer acknowledges, and agrees, to the following limitations of service:
a. Not a telecommunications service. The Service is not a telecommunications service and the Company provides it on a best efforts basis. Important distinctions exist between telecommunications service and the Service offering that We provide. The Service is subject to different regulatory treatment than telecommunications service. This treatment may limit or otherwise affect your rights of redress before regulatory agencies.
b. Operator assisted calling. The Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 511 and/or other x11 (other than certain specified dialing such as 911 and 411, which are provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) Services in one or more (or all) Service areas.
c. Phone numbers. The phone numbers you obtain from Us for Residential Service will not be listed in any telephone directories. Phone numbers transferred from your local phone company may, however, be listed. As a result, someone with your phone number may not be able to utilize a reverse directory to lookup your address.
d. Compatibility with other devices and systems. The Service may not be compatible with non-voice devices. All non-voice communications equipment, including but not limited to, home security systems or alarm systems that are set up to make automatic phone calls, modems, data modems, any device that relies upon a modem, or other hearing impaired devices, and medical monitoring devices (“Non-Voice Systems”), are not considered compatible with the Service and may be interrupted or permanently disabled by installation or operation of the Service. You should maintain a telephone connection through your local exchange carrier in order to use any alarm monitoring functions for any security system installed in your home or business. You are solely responsible for the operation and use of such Non-Voice Systems with the Service, including taking any necessary steps, as permitted under your agreements with the Company, to ensure compatibility between such Non-Voice Systems and the Service.
e. Other providers. You authorize the Company to act on your behalf, as your agent, in moving your telephone number and related local and long distance services from your current provider to the Company or any of its wholesale service providers. You acknowledge that the Company may change wholesale providers from time to time and may move your phone number from one wholesale carrier to another at any time. You acknowledge that the Company will become the customer of record for all phone numbers that We move or “port” to the Service.
f. Security. The Service relies upon portions of the public Internet, and third party networks, to transmit voice and other communications signals. The Company cannot, and does not, guarantee that the Service is secure, or can be used in a secure manner.
g. High-Risk Uses. The Service is not fail-safe or designed or intended for use in situations where error-free or uninterrupted service is essential, including uses involving vital communications in which an error or interruption in the Service could lead to injury to business, persons, property or the environment (“High-Risk Uses”).

As such, it may have certain limitations. E911 service includes transmission of your telephone number, and information you provide to SUCCEED.NET about the physical location of the equipment and facilities that are used to provide your VOIP Service (“Registered Location”). When you dial 911, your emergency services call will be routed to the applicable Public Safety Answering Point, or other applicable emergency services call center, or local emergency authority (“PSAP”). If the PSAP is capable of receiving your telephone number and Registered Location (“E911 Information”), such information will also be conveyed to the PSAP when you dial 911.

d. UPDATED LOCATION INFORMATION – AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW, IF YOU USE THE VOIP SERVICE AT A NEW REGISTERED LOCATION, IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER YOU NOTIFY SUCCEED.NET OF THE NEW REGISTERED LOCATION BEFORE 911 CALLING OR E911 FUNCTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND
e. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS – NETWORK CONGESTION, RADIO INTERFERENCE, WEAK WIRELESS SIGNALS, OR OTHER CAUSES OF REDUCED INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PERFORMANCE MAY PREVENT YOU FROM USING THE VOIP SERVICE TO CALL 911 OR MAY DELAY THE ROUTING OF YOUR 911 CALL OR E911 INFORMATION. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THE VOIP SERVICE AS YOUR PRIMARY METHOD TO OBTAIN EMERGENCY SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THESE LIMITATIONS, WE SUGGEST YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE METHODS AVAILABLE TO CALL 911 OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN EMERGENCY SERVICES, SUCH AS THROUGH A TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE LINE OR A MOBILE PHONE.
