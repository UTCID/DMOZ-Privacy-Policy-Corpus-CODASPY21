General information

These terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ohio, USA, where RRCNA is incorporated.

Injunctive relief
In the event you breach or threaten breach of these terms of use, you acknowledge and agree that RRCNA will be greatly and irreparably damaged and the damages will be difficult to quantify. Therefore, RRCNA may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction accepting jurisdiction under this specific provision, that, regardless of the governing law provision, will apply the laws of its own jurisdiction in determining whether RRCNA will be granted an injunctive or other equitable relief to stop your breach or your threat of breach, without impairing, invalidating, negating, or voiding RRCNA’s rights to relief in either law or equity.

This agreement may be modified only by our posting of changes to these terms and conditions, or by written agreement signed by both parties. Any inquiries concerning these terms and conditions of use should be directed to our communications staff.
