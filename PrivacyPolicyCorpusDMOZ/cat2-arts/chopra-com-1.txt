These Terms govern your access and use of Chopra Global, LLC (“Chopra,” “we,” “us” or “our”) products and services including any digital offerings provided via our websites (e.g., chopra.com, chopracentermeditation.com, choprateachers.com, choprapsm.com, chopraananda.com, and any other sites to which these Terms are linked) and mobile applications (e.g., the Chopra Meditation & Well-Being app, the 21-Day Meditation Experience app, and the Ananda app) as well as our in-person programs and consumer products (collectively, the “Services”) and in other ways as set forth herein. We refer to our websites and mobile applications (each, an “App”) collectively as our “Digital Properties”. These Terms also govern your use of all information, documents, catalogs, communications, files, text, graphics, and audio/visual content (collectively, the “Materials”) made available to you by way of the Services whether by oral, visual, electronic or other means. We have organized these Terms so that the paragraphs applicable to all products and services appear in the main section. Terms applicable only to a particular product or service appear in distinct sections that follow to make it easier to understand what applies to your specific interactions with us.1. Acceptance of the TermsPLEASE READ THESE TERMS BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. BY USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES, VISITING ANY OF OUR DIGITAL PROPERTIES OR ACCESSING IN ANY WAY ANY MATERIALS, YOU AGREE TO AND ARE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY OTHER TERMS WHICH MAY APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICE, DIGITAL PROPERTIES OR MATERIALS.We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, without any prior notice to you. Any updates to these Terms will be posted or linked to from our Digital Properties, including at www.chopra.com, and will apply to you prospectively, so you should check back each time you use our Services so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.2. Medical and Therapeutic DisclaimerWe provide Materials for general informational purposes only and these Materials are not intended or implied to serve as medical or therapeutic advice, diagnosis or treatment. You should not use any Materials as a preventative health measure, gauge the state of your health or to diagnose or treat any health issues, illnesses or diseases. Chopra does not provide any medical or therapeutic advice. If you have or suspect you have a health or medical problem, you should consult with your physician or another qualified healthcare provider.Chopra neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of any products, services, events, opinions, advice, or statements made by anyone other than an authorized Chopra representative while acting in their official capacity. 3.

In no event will the Chopra Parties be liable to you or anyone else for loss, damage or injury relating to any third-party providing you with services, including, but not limited to, Chopra Partners and Chopra Certified Teachers. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply. In no event will the Chopra Parties’ total liability to you for all damages, loss, or causes of action, if any, exceed the amount you have paid to Chopra for the product or service giving rise to the claim.The limitation of liability set out above does not apply to liability resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Chopra and its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, service providers, employees, and representatives (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, expenses, damages and/or liabilities, including reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in any way related to your (a) acts and/or omissions on or off the Digital Properties or while otherwise using or accessing our Services; (b) violation of any rights of another party, including without limitation any alleged infringement of intellectual property or other right of any person or entity relating to the Digital Properties, Services, or User Generated Material; (c) breach of these Terms; (d) disputes with or between other users; (e) use and/or misuse of the Digital Properties or Materials; (f) violation of any applicable law or regulation; (g) submitting inaccurate, untimely, incomplete or misleading User Generated Material; (h) misstatements and/or misrepresentations; or (i) contracts or arrangements made or provided based on any Materials provided via the Services. You must cooperate as requested by Chopra in the defense of such claims. Chopra reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by, and you shall not, in any event, settle any claim or matter on behalf of Chopra without the written consent of Chopra. This indemnification obligation shall survive the cessation of your use of the Services.If applicable, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”12. Dispute Resolution/Mediation/No Class ReliefIf any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, Materials, your access or use of the Digital Properties, or these Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution thereto. If we do not have a current physical or email address for you, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to us at our contact details below. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we will engage in a dialogue with you in order to attempt to resolve the dispute though nothing will require either of us to resolve the dispute on terms with respect to which either you or we, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. If you have any concerns or objections regarding any financial charges, you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third-party payment processing charges until and unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with us.All disputes arising out of or relating the Services, Materials, your access or use of the Digital Properties, or these Terms that remain unresolved following the dialogue described above will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration held in New York County, New York in accordance with the applicable Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, disputes will be mediated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
