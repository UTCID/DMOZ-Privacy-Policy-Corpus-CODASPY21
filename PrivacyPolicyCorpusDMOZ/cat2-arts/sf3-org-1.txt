Your privacy is of great concern to WisCon and to SF3. Any personal information we collect on any of our sites will only be used for WisCon and SF3 internal purposes. We never sell or share any of this information we collect with any third parties, except when we are legally required to do so.
We will use your information
to keep track of you in our database and save you time when you come back to check on or update your profile, schedule, or other information;
to create your name badge and registration packet;
to get in touch with you in case of emergency;
to analyze demographic information for convention planning; and
in other ways we feel are appropriate as convention organizers.
Technical Details
We only use session cookies, and then only to keep track of your session when you’re logged into the WisCon application. If you create an account in the application, we only store a digest of your password. We do not store credit card numbers or related details on the WisCon site, but if you purchase your registration (or anything else) through our site, we will provide that information to Paypal. If you’re concerned, you should review Paypal’s privacy policy.
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please use the “Contact Us” link in the top navigation bar toward the right-hand side of your screen.
