Media FX Privacy Policy
Digital Media FX is dedicated to protecting the privacy of its
users. As of February 18, 2001 the following outlines proper privacy
disclosures:
Information Collection and Use
Digital Media FX is the sole owner of the information collected
on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information
to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
Cookies
Like most other Websites, Digital Media FX uses cookies as a simple
form of gathering Web statistics. Usage of a cookie is in no way
linked to any personally identifiable information while on our
site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example,
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these
cookies.
Log Files
Like most other Websites, Digital Media FX uses IP addresses to
analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses
are not linked to personally identifiable information and are
only used for Website statistics.
Sharing
Digital Media FX does not share user information with our advertisers.
Furthermore, Digital Media FX does not provide user information
to anyone who requests it. Digital Media FX is a strong believer
in the privacy rights of its users.
Links
Digital Media FX does contain links to other sites. Please be
aware that Digital Media FX is not responsible for the privacy
practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware
when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information relating
only to this site.
Newsletter
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact
information such as name and email address.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time Digital Media FX requests information from users
via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests
is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether
or not to disclose this information. Information requested may
include contact information (such as name and shipping address),
and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact
information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend
about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.
Digital Media FX will automatically send the friend a one-time
email inviting them to visit the site. Digital Media FX stores
this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time
email.
Security
Digital Media FX takes every precaution to protect its users'
information. If you have any questions about the security at our
website, you can send an email to joetracy@earthlink.net.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
changes on our Front Page so our users are always aware of what
information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances,
if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
at the time it was collected, we will notify users via this privacy
policy. We will use information in accordance with the privacy
policy under which the information was collected.
