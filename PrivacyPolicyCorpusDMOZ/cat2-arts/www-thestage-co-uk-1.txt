Subscriptions have a period of one year, one quarter or one month from the welcome message (or end of free trial, if appropriate), unless we expressly state otherwise. Because we make arrangements for the provision of the Products on receipt of your order, your only right of cancellation (other than in respect of a free trial) is as set out below. A subscription ordered online, via phone or email and paid by Direct Debit (DD) or Continuous Credit Card (CCC) will renew automatically unless we or you cancel it. You may cancel your subscription to prevent automatic renewal but you must do so before automatic renewal has taken place in order to avoid being billed for the continued subscription.

In order to be refunded, notice of cancellation must be made within 4 weeks of payment being taken for any subscription with a term of 3 months or longer. No refunds will be issued for any subscription with a time period of less than three months. The Stage reserves the right to charge an £8 administration fee when processing refunds. If, in our reasonable opinion, you are in breach of any term of this Agreement, we may cancel this Agreement with you and reserve our right not to pay you a refund. These provisions do not affect your other statutory rights.Student subscriptions work on a fixed rate for two years, subscribers will then automatically renew on to a full price subscription. When the subscription auto-renews a subscriber’s term will remain the same. Students may be required to provide evidence of their student status and a subscription may be cancelled if satisfactory proof cannot be provided.Subscribers are not allowed to share their subscription details with others.
