Disclaimer for Law Enforcement/Criminal Justice Majors
Many law enforcement/criminal justice agencies require certain standards of prospective employees at the application stage. Job applications uniformly ask applicants if they have ever been arrested for any offense, either misdemeanor or felony. An affirmative response or finding on the part of a prospective employer may be grounds to deny employment. A second requirement may require applicants to take psychological tests, lie detector tests, and medical tests in order to determine if applicants are suited for a particular position.
With respect to the above, the RRCC Law Enforcement Academy, RRCC advises that entrance into any law enforcement course of study or subsequent graduation is no guarantee, explicit or implied, that a student is employable. Further, should a student be unable to be placed and/or remain in the course, Cooperative Education/Internship, after two good faith attempts at placement, neither RRCC nor its employees accept responsibility in respect to the student’s fulfillment of this program.
In an attempt to appropriately advise prospective students, a prior arrest and/or drug and alcohol history should be discussed with a Law Enforcement advisor prior to the student’s admission into the Law Enforcement Program. Neither RRCC nor Law Enforcement/Criminal Justice advisors will be held liable for a student’s decision to continue in the program.

Sexual Harassment Notice
RRCC does not tolerate or condone sexual harassment in any form. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when:
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment or for participation in a class or program.
Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for decisions on employment or student grades.
Such conduct substantially interferes with an individual’s work or classroom performance creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) deems all acts of non-consensual sexual contact (i.e. “sexual violence”), such as “rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, and sexual coercion” as sexual harassment and therefore within Title IX’s purview (See OCR April 4, 2011 DCL, p. 1-2).
Sexual Misconduct includes unwanted or attempted sexual activity, touching, or behavior. Sexual misconduct includes, but is not limited to the following:
Sexual Harassment: Unwanted behavior or language based on gender that prevents someone from attending or benefiting from class, work, or other RRCC activities. Harassment can happen between any people and can be mild or severe (see below matrix).
Examples:
Unwanted sexual advances, asking for sexual favors.
Gender-based stalking, bullying, or hazing.
Trying to pressure an unwilling person into a sexual situation.
Violence between people in a relationship.
Repeatedly giving someone unwelcome attention that is sexual in nature.
Non-Consensual Sexual Contact: Any sexual touching (such as groping or fondling) that ison purpose and/or by force.
Non-Consensual Sexual Intercourse: Any sexual penetration (such as rape or unwanted oral sex)without consent and/or by force.
Sexual Exploitation: Taking advantage of another person in a sexual situation. For example:invasion of sexual privacy, recording sexual activity without consent, or watching anotherperson in an intimate situation without consent.
Sexual harassment as defined above may include, but is not limited to, the following:
Sex-oriented verbal “kidding,” abuse, or harassment.
Unwelcome sexual advances or pressure for sexual activity.
Repeated remarks to a person with sexual or demeaning implications or the use of vulgarity.
Unwelcome touching, such as patting, pinching or brushing against another’s body.
Suggesting or demanding sexual involvement, accompanied by implied or explicit threats concerning one’s grades, employment status or similar personal concerns.
Unwelcome posters, letters or other writings or communications of a sexual nature.
Other verbal or physical conduct of a harassing nature.
Sexual harassment is illegal and is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and Title IX which prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities. RRCC is committed to upholding this policy prohibiting sexual harassment. Violation of this policy may be grounds for dismissal. While it is the purpose of this policy to protect all persons associated with the College from sexual harassment, it is also a violation of this policy to knowingly make a false allegation of sexual harassment.
If you feel you have been subjected to sexual harassment and need information about what to do, consult the Sexual Misconduct / Title IX Overview page. All matters involving sexual harassment complaints are taken seriously and will be investigated. Complaints will remain confidential to the fullest extent possible. Filing of a complaint or otherwise reporting sexual harassment will not reflect upon the individual’s status or affect future employment, work assignments, or grades.

Complaint Procedures
If you are taking any Red Rocks Community College courses, and you have a complaint about your experience with Red Rocks Community College (RRCC), you have two options:
You can follow Red Rocks Community College’s process for student complaints, which can be found in the Student Handbook. To file an official complaint please use the Student Complaint/Grievance Form. You may also contact the Higher Learning Commission http://www.ncahlc.org/ , which is Red Rocks Community College’s accrediting agency.
If you are residing outside of Colorado while attending Red Rocks Community College, in many cases you can file a complaint in the state where you are residing. As required by federal regulations, a list of agencies in each state where complaints can be filed can be found here.
Before exercising either of the above options, you should know that most (if not all) external complaint processes require that the student exhaust all avenues of complaint internal to the institution before they will consider a grievance.
