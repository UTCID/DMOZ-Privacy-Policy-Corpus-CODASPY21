Privacy Policy for Vermont Public Radio This privacy statement is intended to be transparent about what is shared when using VPR.org and our digital products. As you use VPR.org and VPR’s digital services, you are using a variety of web services and platforms. Some of those services allow you to share information directly with VPR, such as your email, your donation or a comment on a story. Some services collect anonymous information passively as you use the site, such as the type of browser or operating system you are using. We Collect Some Information DirectlyOn certain occasions when you interact with VPR’d digital platforms – e.g., by joining as a member, signing up for a newsletter, or commenting on a story – you may submit information of your own accord, or be asked to do so to participate in certain activities.

Without them, first-time visitors would be indistinguishable from returning users, your preferred stream would have to be chosen every time and other preferences would be lost between visits.
