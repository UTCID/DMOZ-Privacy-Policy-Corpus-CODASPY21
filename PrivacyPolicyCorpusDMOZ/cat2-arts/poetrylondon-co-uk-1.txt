Privacy Policy
Introduction
The law on data protection in the UK changed on May 2018, when the new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force.

This policy outlines the processes we have put in place to make sure we are working in line with the new GDPR regulations.
If you have any queries about our privacy policy please email admin@poetrylondon.co.uk or call 020 8228 5707. Please note this policy may be updated, and we will ensure that the latest version is always available on our website.
