We need to collect personal information to provide certain Services.

Other Sites and Services
The Services may contain links to other websites and online services operated by third parties.
These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.
In addition, our content may be included on web pages or other online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.

In some cases, the partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our partner applies to the partner's use of your information.
For example we make our audiocasts available through a third-party host. When you register for an audiocast, the host will collect information from you directly and will share it with us. The host will provide its privacy policy at the point of registration.
The privacy policy of our partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our partners, you should contact the partner directly for more information.

Right to opt out of the "sale" of your Personal Information. Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to users as described in the Interest-based advertising section above.
