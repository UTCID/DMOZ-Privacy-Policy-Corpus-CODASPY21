Copyright Resources
Who owns what? How, when, and where
can it be used? As classrooms move from being geographically bound to being
intellectually bound, instructors are faced with more challenges in determining
legal use of digital material. The following resources are designed to
assist faculty, distance learning administrators, multimedia developers,
website producers, and and students navigate the murkey waters in a sea
of new copyright law.
