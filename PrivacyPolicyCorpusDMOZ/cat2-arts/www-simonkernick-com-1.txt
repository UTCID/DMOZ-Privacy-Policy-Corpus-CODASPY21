Die Alone
Simon Kernick
________________________"Simon Kernick is an absolute master of the adrenaline-fuelled ride" - PETER JAMESThe latest high-octane thriller from Sunday Times bestselling author Simon Kernick ________________________Alastair Sheridan has it all. Wealth, good looks, a beautiful wife and children and, in the chaotic world of British politics, a real chance of becoming Prime Minister.
But Alastair also has a secret. He's a serial killer with a taste for young women. Only a handful of people know what kind of monster he is, and disgraced detective Ray Mason is one of them.
Awaiting trial for murder, Ray is unexpectedly broken free by armed men and given an offer: assassinate Alastair Sheridan and begin a new life abroad with a new identity. The men claim to be from MI6. They say that Sheridan is a threat to national security and needs to be neutralised. Ray knows they are not who they say they are, and that their real motives are far darker. The only person Ray trusts is ex-cop and former lover Tina Boyd who's keen to settle her own scores with Sheridan.
With enemies on every side, only one thing is certain.
No one wants them to get out alive. ________________________"Simon Kernick is one of the most reliable purveyors of the edge-of-your-seat thriller... a more powerful adrenaline rush than an EpiPen" - JAKE KERRIDGE, SUNDAY EXPRESS "An emotionally punchy domestic noir blended with the pace and action of a high-octane thriller, WE CAN SEE YOU will keep you breathlessly on the edge of your seat, wondering which character you can trust, if any at all, until the final brilliant twist! A #WTFthatending indeed!" - SARAH PINBOROUGH, author of BEHIND HER EYES and CROSS HER HEART "A pacy thriller, with a body count that rises along with the tension levels" - SUNDAY MIRROR "Simon Kernick manages to ring fresh changes (and revelations) at every point... He remains one of the most consistently suspenseful and ingenious writers in the field" - FINANCIAL TIMES "Thriller-meister Simon Kernick's standalone books are always worth picking up - and his latest is no exception" - SUNDAY SPORT"The story races along in spare, thriller-writer's prose, full of practical and operational detail, a world of tangled motives and divided loyalties, before reaching an action-packed climax" - COUNTRY AND TOWNHOUSE"Simon Kernick has moved into quite gothic territory. It makes for a gripping trilogy" - THE CRIME NOVEL READER

Simon Kernick on Tina Boyd
Tina Boyd is a maverick detective who may or may not have a death wish. The thriller master explains how he created his much-loved protagonist
Simon Kernick is one of Britain’s most exciting thriller writers. He arrived on the crime writing scene with his highly acclaimed debut novel The Business of Dying, the story of a corrupt cop moonlighting as a hitman. Simon's big breakthrough came with his novel Relentless which was the biggest selling thriller of 2007. His most recent crime thrillers include Siege, Ultimatum, Stay Alive and The Final Minute. He is also the author of the bestselling three-part serial thrillers Dead Man’s Gift and One By One. Simon talks both on and off the record to members of the Counter Terrorism Command and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, so he gets to hear first hand what actually happens in the dark and murky underbelly of UK crime.
