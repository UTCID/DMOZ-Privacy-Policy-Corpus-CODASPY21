State Theatre New Jersey is committed to respecting the privacy of its customers and all visitors of the State Theatre website. The following document details the policies that State Theatre New Jersey has in place to safeguard your privacy. By using our website and creating an account, you are agreeing to the policies below.
Collection of Information
State Theatre New Jersey uses the personal information it collects to process your orders, to notify you of event changes and updates, and to personalize your website experience, offering you unique ticket offers or event invitations based on your interests.
When you create an account on www.STNJ.org you share your first name, last name, and email address with us. Your mailing address is required to purchase tickets, enter a contest, or make a contribution. When transacting a sale, we will also require your credit card number. In certain jurisdictions, such as the European Union, you may have specific rights to access, change, transfer or request removal of personal information about you. If you have requests or questions concerning use of your personal information please email info@stnj.org.
State Theatre New Jersey may share information with various entities such as third party renters as part of fulfillment of VIP or other programs presented by these entities. When you make a purchase in connection with a performance presented or produced by a third party organization, State Theatre will provide said third party with the information regarding your purchase. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as details of your purchase, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the date you purchased your tickets, any offer you responded to, the locations of your seats, and the dollar amount of your transaction.
Mailing address information is never sold, rented or freely given to any outside entity. Mailing address information may be traded with other nonprofit arts companies for a one-time usage through a third-party mail house or service. This is common industry practice.

Please note, we may still email you with important information (show cancellations, changes, etc.)  about events you have tickets to even if you have unsubscribed from marketing and fundraising emails.
