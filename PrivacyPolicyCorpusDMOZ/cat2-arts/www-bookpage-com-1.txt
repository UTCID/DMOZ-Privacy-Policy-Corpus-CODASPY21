BookPage has a firm commitment to our customers' privacy. This explains our policy regarding the use by BookPage of information collected from EMAIL USERs.
User Information
Upon a USER's request, BookPage will (a) remove a USER's EMAIL address from the BookPage EMAIL database; or (b) correct a USER's EMAIL information that the USER states is erroneous.
Marketing and Use of Email Address
BookPage may use a USER's EMAIL information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve the EMAIL content and/or layout, and to determine general marketplace information about EMAIL USERS. BookPage does not sell or rent a USER's EMAIL information to any third party. However, when a USER provides their EMAIL information for a specific promotion, BookPage may share the information with any co-sponsors of that promotion.
Updates To This Policy
If BookPage decides to change or update this EMAIL Policy, it will post the changes so that the USER is always aware of what information BookPage collects, how it uses that information, and under what circumstances BookPage discloses it. BookPage encourages each USER to review this policy from time to time so USERS will know if the policy has been updated or amended.
