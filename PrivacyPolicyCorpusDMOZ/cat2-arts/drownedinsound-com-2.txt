Drowned in Sound Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 15th May 2012
DiS Privacy Policy
We at Drowned in Sound are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognise your need for appropriate
protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with
us.
Drowned in Sound has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we
intend to treat your Personal Information.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited
to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information,
whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit Drowned in Sound’s Web pages without telling us who you are
or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within
Drowned in Sound or to Drowned in Sound’s third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or
jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
Drowned in Sound strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your
privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Drowned in Sound intends to adhere to the
principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your
Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for
your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no
matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may
be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may
serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control
cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your
browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your
original username and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP)
addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is
accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web
experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and
statistics.
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:
• Notice: ?Where Drowned in Sound collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose
statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether we plan to share such Personal
Information outside of Drowned in Sound or those working on Drowned in Sound’s behalf. Drowned in Sound does not
intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Drowned
in Sound’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
• Choice?: You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Drowned in Sound. The notice we
intend to provide where Drowned in Sound collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this
choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Drowned in
Sound’s Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our
interaction with you.
Opt-Out Options
As demonstrated above, Drowned in Sound take great care to protect user privacy.
We currently operate an ‘implied consent’ policy which means that by not-opting out, we assume you are happy with
this usage.

If you chose to have a relationship with Drowned in Sound, such as a contractual or other business relationship
or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
• Security: ?Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Drowned in Sound or on its behalf, we intend
to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from
unauthorised access or disclosure.
• Access/Accuracy: ?To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Drowned in Sound wishes to
maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to
provide a means of contacting Drowned in Sound should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any
reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal
Information to editor@drownedinsound.com and we
will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as
practicable.
Third Party Services
Third parties provide certain services available on Drowned in Sound.com on Drowned in Sound’s behalf. Drowned in
Sound may provide information, including Personal Information, that Drowned in Sound collects on the Web to
third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Service providers
are also an important means by which Drowned in Sound maintains its Web site and mailing lists. Drowned in Sound
will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal
Information on Drowned in Sound’s behalf.
Drowned in Sound will not transfer Personal Information to third parties who are not bound to act on Drowned in
Sound’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against Drowned in Sound’s policy to
sell Personal Information.
Children’s Privacy

Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.

We are committed to privacy and are actively involved in and support current industry initiatives to preserve
individual privacy rights on the Internet. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and Drowned in
Sound’s Web sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands.

guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.
