Following notification of cessation of membership all personal information will be deleted within one month of the date of notification. If membership is not renewed and there is no response to two written reminders sent within three months of the renewal date that membership will be deleted one month after the second reminder.
4.  Under the terms of the GDPR Society members have the right to request sight of the information held on them by the Society, and can do so by contacting the membership secretary. As the basis on which this information is held is consent (current members are all considered to have consented to their data being held and therefore to have ‘opted in’ under the terms of the GDPR) members can request that any part of the data held on them is rectified or deleted at any time, by means of application to the membership secretary.
