Privacy
Statement
At Ernest Tubb Record Shops, protecting your private information
is of the utmost importance. We have done our best to ensure the privacy and
security of your transactions with us. Your credit card number and other personal
data will be treated with the highest standards of safety, security features,
and confidentiality.
Secure Shopping
Protecting your order information is a priority. We utilize SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure safe, secure transactions. With SSL, information
sent via the Internet is encrypted and can be trusted to arrive privately and
unaltered. When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at
the lower portion of your browser window, then you know that the site is secured
through SSL. We believe this provides the most effective way to ensure that
your order information is protected.
If you have any concerns about ordering electronically, please
call 615-255-7503 to place your order over the phone.
Your Privacy Online
At Ernest Tubb Record Shops, we are committed to ensuring your
privacy as a customer. We do utilize "cookies" on our site to retain
items you place in your shopping cart through multiple sessions or visits. Customer
information is used strictly to process your order and to improve your shopping
experience. We send an email message confirming the receipt of each online order.
We do not sell or make available our customer email list, nor postal address
list to anyone. Your information will not be shared with any other companies.
If you have any questions about our privacy policy or about
the accuracy of your personal information in our records, please do not hesitate
to call or write.
