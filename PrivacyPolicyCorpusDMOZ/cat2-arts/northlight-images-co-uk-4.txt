Northlight Images COVID-19 policy

Covid Policy
Precautions in the current pandemic
We are following current UK HSE Covid advice.
The following notes indicate our approach to cleaning, risk assessment and working practices in connection with our photographic business activities.
COVID-19 policy
Northlight Images are a family business and we work from home. Apart from work we have little contact with others outside our home/work bubble (we have no children or care responsibilities for parents etc). We are confident that this lack of contact makes us a relatively low risk business, however we are still committed to protecting ourselves and our clients.
What we will do
Protect ourselves from exposure by limiting contact outside of our social bubble
Follow all government guidelines regarding hygiene, face coverings and social distancing – including having our own supply of sanitiser, cleaning products & face coverings
Cancel any work if either of us is unwell
Complete a full Covid risk assessment for every project/site/client in conjunction with information provided by the client and using HSE guidelines/risk assessment templates
Provide a copy of the risk assessment to our client(s) if required
When asked, provide any details required to allow the site/company we are visiting to do their own risk assessment
What we would like you to do
Provide us with as much information as possible about the project/site/company to enable us to do a full risk assessment
Assure us in writing that the site/company we will be visiting has also done a full risk assessment – and provide us with a copy if required
Make it as easy as possible for us to be able to follow all government guidelines regarding hygiene, face coverings and social distancing – so for example providing hand sanitiser, social distancing precautions where staff are present
Ensuring that no one we may come into contact with is infectious
Additional Terms and Conditions
During the current pandemic the following should be considered part of our standard T&Cs: http://www.northlight-images.co.uk/commercial-photography/terms-and-conditions/
Should we arrive on site for work and find that the conditions are not Covid Secure, we will leave immediately without completing the work. Under these circumstances we reserve the right to charge you, the client, our first hour’s rate as a cancellation fee, along with any expenses incurred. We will provide details and if necessary photographic evidence if asked.
