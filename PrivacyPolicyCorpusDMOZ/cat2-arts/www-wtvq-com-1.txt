This Privacy Policy provides you with information concerning our practices and procedures as they relate specifically to information we collect at the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means; for example, at a live event, via mail, or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
We are strongly committed to preserving online privacy for all of our Website visitors, including children. This Website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children. Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13, knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with our Website or to provide any other personally identifying information. If you’re under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information about yourself (such as your name, your email address or your phone number).
TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE ON THIS WEBSITE
The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information (for example, your name and address) that you voluntarily supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our sites, use our services such as free email, or read our email newsletters. In some cases, it is an agent or affiliate of ours that collects the information on our behalf. Third party providers featured on or linked to by our Website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our Website, may be gathering the same kinds of information. You are not required to provide any non-public personally identifiable information on this Website. We gather customer information you may volunteer when inquiring about our products and services or when using our products and services. New Vision and our business partners use this information only for the purposes of inquiry follow-up or for operational delivery of products and services. We do not collect any non-public personally identifiable information about you at our Website unless you choose to provide it to us voluntarily. We define “non-public personally identifiable information” as information that is unique to you or a third party and might include your name, phone number, company name, company address, insurance policy number, account username or password. If you encounter a window or page that requests information that you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that window or page. If you do provide us with non-public personally identifiable information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected, and we will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of New Vision or its affiliates unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so, (2) it is necessary to allow our trusted service providers or agents to provide services for us, (3) in order to provide our products or services to you, (4) it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements that obligate such entities to maintain the privacy of your non-public personally identifiable information, or (5) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.
EMAIL
We appreciate your questions and comments about our Website, products and services and welcome your email messages to mailbox(es) listed on our Website. We will share your messages with those within our organization who are most capable of addressing the issues contained in your message. We will keep a copy of your message until we have had an opportunity to address your concerns. We may archive your message for a certain period of time or discard it, but your email address will not be used for any other purpose.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY
Security is a top priority at the Website. When you submit sensitive information to our Website, your information is protected both online and offline. We restrict access to non-public personally identifiable information collected about you at our Website to our employees, WTVQ-TV, LLC and our affiliates’ employees, or others who need to know that information to provide services to you or in the course of conducting our normal business operations. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect non-public personally identifiable information. We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons. We also advise all employees, service providers, agents and affiliates about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our company’s business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.
REGISTRATION INFORMATION
To make use of certain features on our Website (such as to receive email newsletters, or post a classified ad), visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our Website. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, gender, age, zip code or credit card number, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our Website to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions that may be made available on our Website. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don’t supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our Website. For example, we can’t send you email alerting you to a new service we’re offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you don’t tell us what you’re interested in and give us your email address.
CONTESTS AND OTHER PROMOTIONS
From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our Website. If you enter one of these promotions, you’ll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We may share this information with New Vision, our affiliates and with any co-sponsor of the promotion (we will identify any co-sponsor in the official rules for the promotion). If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to our affiliates or contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.
EMAIL NEWSLETTERS
We may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors. If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us. See “Opting Out” below.
COOKIES
To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a “cookie,” to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. A cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them. The cookie doesn’t actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our Website. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won’t know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. Our cookies do not gather non-public personally identifiable information. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can’t read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our Website may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don’t control. We use cookies to help us tailor our Website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. For example, we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our Website visited by our users. We can build a better Website if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our Website. We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our websites and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers or process credit card purchases for our website. We use the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.
OTHER METHODS OF COLLECTING INFORMATION
Our web pages may contain electronic images (called “single-pixel GIFs” or “web beacons”) that allow us and our vendors to count users who have visited particular pages or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also be able to verify your online purchases from us or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with us.
BROWSER LEVEL INFORMATION AND IP ADDRESSES
Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our Website, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.) We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our Website to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our Website.
THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING
The ads appearing on this Website are delivered to you by third party advertisers, our Web hosting partner,and sponsors. Information about your visits to this Website, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal in-formation), is used to serve ads to you.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES
In the course of serving advertisements to this Website, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
We will not share non-public personally identifiable information you provide when registering on our Website with advertisers. We may, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this Website and associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally. Vendors and Service Providers To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers (“Provider Partners”). Our chat, email newsletters, email services and online classifieds for example, may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services.

Moreover, regular audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site.

For e-commerce transactions that may be made available on our Website, in certain instances we may transmit your billing information using encryption.

Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration or sign-up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this website such as listener clubs, interactive services such as chat room or blogs, and personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service.
We may use the contact information you give us to better tailor your Web site experience to your interests, and to send you information about us and our services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners.

Supplemental Information

Shopping/Commercial Services
This Web site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us.

Public Forums
This site may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
Information Sharing With Third Parties
From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by WTVQ to provide additional features at this site. These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner?s website for information regarding its privacy policies.
Also, the nature of some features of our Web site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the WTVQ family. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the WTVQ family. By responding to those features, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Web site, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.
With respect to specific registration modules, like contests, we may disclose personal information collected, and we will post a conspicuous statement on the registration module to the effect that we will be disclosing the information collected with third parties.
Finally, we may share any of the information collected from you with these other non-WTVQ companies in an aggregate basis. The aggregated information is not linked to any information that can identify you.
IP Address and Log Files

Cookies
This Web site may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer and help our Web site to recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our Web site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing here previously, to keep track of your shopping cart, to ensure you don’t see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy. In addition, on occasion our site may also set a “session cookie” which helps us administer the Web site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires.
Finally, we may also use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this and other WTVQ Web sites. This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. However, if you do so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site.
Banner Advertising
We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our Web sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software remains in our possession and no data is transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.

Sale or Merger
If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by WTVQ, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from this website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company.
