HBS Entertainment Networks Statement of Privacy
Since we were founded, HBS Entertainment Networks has tried to help its users
retain their privacy while they take advantage of all the Internet has to
offer. We are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology
that gives you the safest and most powerful online experience that you can get
anywhere. And beer. If you have questions about this, please write us
at .
Privacy Principles
Because your privacy is important to us, we will operate by the following five principles.
Principle 1
HBS Entertainment Networks (incorporating eFilmCritic.com and HollywoodBitchslap.com) explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") beyond your name and email address. HBS Entertainment Networks asks for general contact information only occasionally and, where appropriate, credit card information through third party sellers. No credit card information is stored on our server at any time.
Principle 2
HBS Entertainment Networks and our affiliates and service partners use limited Personal Information to operate the HBS Entertainment Networks sites and services, to communicate with you regarding your account and to compile general demographic statistics.
Principle 3
HBS Entertainment Networks will never disclose your Personal Information unless required to do so by order of a court of law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on HBS Entertainment Networks, or our sites; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of HBS Entertainment Networks, our sites or the users of said sites; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of HBS Entertainment Networks, our sites or the public.

From time to time, HBS Entertainment Networks may be required to send you information about the service or your account. Except as mentioned above, HBS Entertainment Networks will never send you unsolicited information, commercial offers or advertisements, including e-mail.
Principle 5
If at any time you believe that HBS Entertainment Networks has not adhered to
these principles, please notify us by e-mail at
and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
