Last Modified: May 25, 2018This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access Playbill Online Inc.'s Playbill.com ("Playbill") service (the "Service") through our website www.playbill.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A "Device" is any computer used to access the Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as "Data."1. Data We Collect And StoreWe may collect and store the following information when running the Service:Information You Provide. To use the Service, you may be invited to register an account, at which point we may collect some personal information, such as your name, eMail address, home or business postal addresses, or other information. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your eMail account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. If we offer a referral page allowing you to invite others to join Playbill or share content, we send them a one-time eMail. You may also provide us with your contacts' eMail addresses when sharing Data with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your eMail address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Playbill to you. Similar information may also be required to participate in other online activities, special events, contests, surveys, or sweepstakes.Pictures. Current or future features may collect and store the pictures you upload to the Service ("Pictures"). If you add a picture to Playbill that has been previously uploaded by you, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.Log Data. When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Data, and other interactions with the Service.Cookies. Playbill, our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or service providers also use "cookies" to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service. We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here or if located in the European Union click here.

If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings.Geo-Location Information. Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our Services do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time, as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with as we improve our Services. Some photos or other files you place in Playbill may contain recorded location information.

If you do not wish to share pictures embedded with your geo-location information, please do not upload them. If you do not want to store location data in your photos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device's location.Analytics. We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes include or be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click here, and to learn how to opt out of that service click here.3. Information Sharing and DisclosureYour Use. We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account.
