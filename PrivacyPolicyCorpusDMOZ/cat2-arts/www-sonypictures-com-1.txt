Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is committed to reducing depictions of tobacco use in the films produced by the company or any wholly-owned film division.SPE has adopted a standard protocol to identify, and where appropriate and feasible, eliminate portrayals of tobacco use.In particular, there will be a working presumption that youth-rated films produced and distributed in the United States shall not feature depictions of tobacco use unless there is a compelling creative justification that may include, but is not limited to, factors such as historical accuracy or an important tie to the creative context of the project and vision of the filmmaker.SPE will continue its existing policy of not entering into product placement arrangements in connection with the depiction of tobacco products. As part of the commitment to this long-standing ban, SPE will, on a going forward basis, indicate in the end credits of films with tobacco depictions that no product placement arrangement was made.With regard to film acquisitions, co-productions, and films produced and distributed outside of the United States, Sony Pictures Entertainment may have limited influence over the content. In these instances, SPE will discourage depictions of tobacco use where reasonable and practical.And finally, Sony Pictures Entertainment strongly supports the continued use of a smoking descriptor in a youth-rated film's MPAA rating so that consumers can make an informed choice when deciding whether a film is appropriate.*Effective December 1, 2012 CONTACT USI have a media/press inquiry – who can I contact?
