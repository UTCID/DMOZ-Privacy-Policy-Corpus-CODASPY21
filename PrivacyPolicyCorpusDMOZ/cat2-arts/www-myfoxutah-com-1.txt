Keep all comments relevant to the particular content where the comment is being posted.
Please note that once you post a comment to one of our sites, it becomes part of the public conversation. Our policy is that we will not remove a user’s comments unless we deem them to be in violation of our Terms of Use. So if you want to say something that you will later regret personally, it is advisable that you use a username that does not identify you. We cannot remove your comments simply because you have a change of heart about making them.
Additionally, it is our policy not to delete comment accounts. My Fox Utah, however, reserves the right to remove comments and comment accounts entirely at its discretion, including for alleged violations of Terms of Use or legal rights.
My Fox Utah is not responsible for the content of user comments.

If they pursue the complaint, we will make reasonable efforts to contact you by the means you have provided us, to alert you to the situation. We will protect your contact information as described in our Privacy Policy, but may be compelled to turn it over pursuant to legal process.

To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written communication (by email with an attached and signed PDF) that sets forth the items specified below.
