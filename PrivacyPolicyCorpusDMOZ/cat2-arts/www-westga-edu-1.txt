Accessibility
Web accessibility refers to how easily people with disabilities can navigate and interact
with websites. Disabilities may be physical (such as blindness, low vision, deafness,
or fine motor skills difficulty), or cognitive (such as dyslexia or attention deficit
disorder). People with disabilities often use assistive technologies to help them
navigate the web. An assistive technology is any device that helps a person with a
disability. Common web assistive technologies include modified mice and keyboards,
screen readers and screen magnifiers.
Web accessibility occurs when websites support web accessibility standards, are compatible
with assistive technologies, and are easy for people to navigate and understand.
Desire2Learn follows web accessibility standards closely and work with interested
clients to test the usability of their products for people with disabilities. They
believe that instructional practices should focus on helping people learn, and should
not be limited by the learning management system the material is delivered in.

What is CoursEval
Formative evaluations/ End-of-term evaluations During the last weeks of the term, the DDEC conducts its own online student evaluation
of instruction. Our evaluations are conducted outside of CourseDen, in CourseEval,
and can be accessed online any time. See the CoursEval Privacy Policy and Accessibility [PDF] statements.
Your instructors welcome your suggestions and take them very seriously. Evaluations
are anonymous and secure. Be assured that instructors cannot access evaluation results
until the final course grades are turned in.
Things to remember
There are two evaluations to complete: One for each of your online courses and one
for UWG|Online.
You can also easily access your evaluations using either your computer or mobile device.
Let Your Voice be Heard!
More than just a box to check off at the end of the semester, the student evaluation of instruction (SEI) is a critical feature for faculty looking
to increase their ability to make a lasting impact on their students. During the last
weeks of the term, the DDEC administers online student evaluation of instruction (SEI)
for all distance courses. These anonymous evaluations are conducted outside of CourseDen,
in CourseEval. They must be completed during the open evaluation time periods each semester, but
can be viewed online at any time.
Specific results are shared with the instructor, the Chair, and the Dean. The Evaluation Summary for Distance Courses form requires that the faculty provide written documentation reflecting on their
DE course evaluation results and how the students' feedback will be used for improvement.
Aggregate results are made available online at: DE Evaluation Documents. Reminders are shared on the UWG|Online social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).
If you get an error message, or do not see your course, check with your professor.
Your professor may have chosen to offer an in-class paper evaluation.
If you have any questions, please e-mail UWG|Online at online@westga.edu or call the UWG|Online Helpline at 678-839-6248 (Mon-Fri from 8am - 5pm).
