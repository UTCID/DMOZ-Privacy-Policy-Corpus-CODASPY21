Shipping Policy
- Fast and Safe.
- Method
We ship almost entirely via FedEx Ground. We may also use United States Postal Service (USPS) or United Parcel Service (UPS).
International orders are shipped primarily via USPS. Note that separate charges may apply for international orders. We will contact international customers prior to shipping to notify of any additional shipping charges and collect payment.
Shipping Times
As soon as your shipment is ready, you will be emailed a tracking number. Due to large order volumes, weather conditions or circumstances beyond our control, we will ship your order out as soon as possible. You may also view your order status online by logging in to your TFG account. If you need expedited framing and/or shipping service, please contact us. Note that fees will apply for expedited service.
- Packaging
We carefully handle and hand-package your artwork ourselves. Unframed canvases and lithographs will ship in a reinforced tube. Unframed cels may be shipped in a flat box. All framed artwork is cornered, wrapped in plastic, then bubble-wrapped and securely packed in a box or crate.
- Damaged Items
We inspect each piece of artwork before it is shipped and pride ourselves on delivering your art to you quickly. We guarantee it to arrive in perfect condition. If for any reason, your artwork shows up in other-than-perfect condition, contact us within 48 hours of receipt and we will repair or replace framing and/or artwork (if necessary and possible) at no additional charge.
Returns
We are 99.9% sure you will absolutely love your art! But for that rare occurrence that you don't, here's what to do.
- Return Policy
To initiate a return, you must contact us within 5 business days of receipt for a full refund. We will send you a return authorization code. Authorization code must be written clearly on return packaging. Customer is responsible for any and all return shipment costs. Artwork and frame must be in original condition for a full refund. A store credit will be issued for any returns requested after the 5-day grace period. After 10 business days from date of sale, all sales are final. Custom or commissioned art sales are final. Original artwork, artwork and select rare limited edition sales are final. All artwork for which customer requests custom framing is subject to the stipulations of the return policy and the cost of framing will be deducted from the total refund or merchandise credit total.
