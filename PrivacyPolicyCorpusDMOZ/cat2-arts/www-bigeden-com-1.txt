Description
15TH ANNIVERSARY BLU-RAY EDITION OF BIG EDEN.
ENJOY THIS SNEAK PEEK AT THE BONUS FEATURETTE THAT IS NOW ON BLU-RAY!
Sometimes when you finally let go, you find something worth holding on to. From out gay writer-director Thomas Bezucha (The Family Stone) comes this funny, heart-warming romantic drama that picked up audience awards at nearly a dozen gay film festivals and charmed critics nationwide!
Big Eden tells a truly original tale of a thirty-something gay guy, Henry Hart (Arye Gross, Ellen, Six Feet Under) who returns to his childhood Montana home to confront his unrequited passion for his high school best friend.
Big Eden is a tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern Montana, where cowboys lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away. It’s also the childhood home of Henry Hart (Arye Gross), a successful but lonely New York artist, who returns after years away to care for his ailing grandfather.
Back home, Henry confronts his unrequited passion for his high school best friend Dean (TimDeKay) and his feelings about being gay in a small town. But, as we quickly learn, Big Eden residents defy the stereotype of “small town, small minds.” As Henry works though his emotions, the townspeople quietly conspire to help him along, until Henry realizes new possibilities for both friendship and romance.
Big Eden is a uniquely American fable about home and family. It hits upon the universal longing and hope we each have for finding a place where we are loved, and the unconditional desire to see those that we love find happiness.
Favorite stars you’ll enjoy seeing include: Arye Gross (Ellen, Citizen Baines), Tim DeKay (White Collar), Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), Eric Schweig (Skins).
