NSCD requests that all participants fill in our consent form which is emailed to you on completion of payment through our online system. This must be completed before attending any participatory events, to make tutors aware of any medical issues and to provide an emergency contact details. Without this NSCD reserves the right to not admit a participant in the event.
For Health and Safety purposes and for enjoyment of our events NSCD sets an upper limit of participant places. Once this limit is met no more places will be available, however participants can place themselves on a waiting list.
Concessions & Bursaries
Concessions are available for our children’s, youth or adult classes on proof of student ID, income support, registered disabilities or senior citizens discount. (Proof of entitlement required).
A discretionary amount of bursaries are available to support those who wish to partake but finance is a barrier. Participants must make a written request to the Learning & Participation Administrator, the email contact is participation@nscd.ac.uk
Registration & Class Attendance:
Please allow at least 20 minutes prior to the scheduled class time for registration. This allows for classes to commence on time and for all participants to register at reception.
A second register will be taken in the studio for fire safety purposes.
NSCD reserves the right to substitute tutors, vary the advertised programme or cancel classes if necessary, without notification.
NSCD reserves the right to release the place of a participant if they have not attended for a minimum of 3 weeks and notified NSCD of their absence.

NSCD reserves the right to take action if it considers that any individual is not acting in an appropriate manner or complying with the above terms. NSCD staff reserve the right to refuse entry to classes at their discretion.
In relation to participants under the age of 18 or in attendance to our Adult Creative Dance class, we appreciate them arriving to and being collected from their classes promptly.
We cannot accept responsibility for participants Year 7 and up once sessions have finished. For younger children we ask that parents/carers wait in the foyer at the end of each session to collect / hand over from the class teacher. In the event of an emergency the office should be notified of late collection at the earliest opportunity upon which your child will be brought to the office until collected.
It is your sole responsibility to ensure you are physically and medically fit to take part in any activities at NSCD.
Participants take classes at their own risk. Please inform reception and your teacher of any medical condition that may affect your participation. We may require a doctor’s confirmation that your participation is approved

The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of this contract.
To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this contract by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You should exercise your right to cancel by contacting us at participation@nscd.ac.uk . You may use the attached model cancellation form, but it is not obligatory.
