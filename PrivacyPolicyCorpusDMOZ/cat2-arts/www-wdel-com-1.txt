MAP | Local authors lay out 'No Malarky Biden Tour of Delaware' for those visiting President-Elect's home state
"I think people are very excited," said Rachel Kipp. "Delaware is definitely a place that has a lot of state pride... I think it's because it's a small state and we all kind of feel like we know each other, and so when something great happens to one of our own, we all really want to celebrate."
