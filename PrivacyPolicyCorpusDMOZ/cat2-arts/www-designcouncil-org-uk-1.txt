Privacy & cookie policy
Design Council respects and protects the privacy of people who use Design Council's website (the “Website”). Individually available information about you is not disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this Privacy Policy.
What information do we collect and how do we use it?
Design Council does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, e-mail address etc), except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
Design Council collects data when you register to receive our email newsletter or via the completion of other sign up forms. We collect this data, via the email address provided, to share with you relevant Design Council/industry related content, namely:
Blogs and website articles produced by Design Council on programme and industry related topics
Newsletters – a periodically produced Design Council news bulletin
Trade Articles – news/articles featuring Design Council programme, product, policy or procedure
Event information – news of upcoming events that we feel would be of interest to you.
Industry and partnership offers, events and discounts that we feel would be of interest to you.
Your details are securely stored on our CRM System and email database. By providing personal details during registration you are consenting to the use of those details for the purposes of identifying you as a unique user.
The information you provide when registering will not be shared with any other entity or organisation, without your explicit consent, aside from our service providers who operate elements of our service and process data on our behalf, and apart from your username, which will appear on blog entries, submissions to forums and other submissions you make for inclusion on the website.
We will not use the information submitted through the registration process on the Website for any other purpose if you indicate that you do not want us to, and we will not pass your contact details to any third party for the purpose of making any marketing communication to you without having first received your explicit consent.
All data collected will be held within the European Union and the European Economic Area or other territory complying with the legal and technical guidelines laid down for handling data by the European Union and will only be used for the specific purpose for which it was sought and to which you consented. It will not be used for any other purpose whatsoever. Any personal data we hold on you will be deleted or updated upon request and any inaccurate or misleading data held will be changed or deleted upon your request.
Details of the data we hold on you will be provided on request. Any request of this nature should be directed to the e-mail address shown at the bottom of this notice.
As required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the Design Council follows strict security procedures in relation to the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access or use of such data. In the event, however, that the Design Council or its officers or employees are required to undertake any act under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act or similar legislation the Design Council or such person shall be entitled and occasionally obliged to do so without informing you. We would also ask that in such circumstances you co-operate with the Design Council.
