Except as otherwise provided herein or in another written agreement with IMAGEZOO or its Licensors, you may access, view, read, download and print the Content (excluding the "Third Party Content and Products") subject to the following conditions:
You may use the Content solely for personal, informational, and internal purposes;

Model and Property Releases / Clearances
The rights IMAGEZOO grants to you do not include a license to any persons, places, property, or subject matter depicted in an Image, which may be subject to copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, moral rights, property rights or other rights belonging to third persons. You shall assume that no model or property releases, or other releases or licenses exist in connection with any of the Images, unless specifically stated in a separate writing by IMAGEZOO. IMAGEZOO makes no representations or warranties that it owns or licenses any rights nor does IMAGEZOO grant you any rights including copyright, trademarks, or rights of publicity belonging to any person, place, property, or subject matter depicted in any Image. Further, IMAGEZOO makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided with the Images. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any Image requires the consent of any third party or the license of any additional rights, and you should not rely solely on the information provided by IMAGEZOO. If you are unsure whether additional rights are needed for your use, you are responsible for consulting with competent legal counsel.
An Image designated as "model released" means that the person depicted in the Image has signed a release permitting reproduction of the Image depicting such person, subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, including without limitation sensitive subject uses. If IMAGEZOO erroneously advises you that an Image is model-released when it is not, IMAGEZOO' liability shall be limited to the amount you paid IMAGEZOO for use of the Image. If an Image depicts a person and is used in a manner that implies the use or endorsement of a product or service by that model, you must indicate that the person depicted is a model and used only for illustrative purposes. Any license granted by IMAGEZOO is conditioned upon your obtaining all necessary third-party rights, releases and permissions. You agree to provide IMAGEZOO with proof of such releases and permissions upon request.

Information Collected From This Website
When you visit this website, some information, such as the site that referred you to us, your IP and email address, and navigational and purchase information, may be collected automatically as part of the site's operation. This information is used to generate user profiles and to personalize the website to your particular interests. On some occasions we may ask you to provide information on online forms. For example, we may ask for your username, password, place of birth, full name, telephone number, email address and postal address, or other information to register online, or for your credit card number or other personally identifying information to fulfill licensing transactions or to receive products or services. We may also ask you about your age, hobbies, income, gender or other information to participate in surveys or other online activities.

How We Use Your Information
The information collected online is stored indefinitely and is used for various purposes, including processing your transactions, customer service, product and service development, direct marketing and marketing analysis, facilitating your use of this website, and customizing your image selection to your particular interests. The information we collect may be shared with our subsidiaries, agents, third party content providers, affiliates, and selected other entities for similar purposes. For example, when you fill out an online registration form on an IMAGEZOO website you may be registered on a number of IMAGEZOO visual content provider websites. That is, your user name and password are carried across these sites, allowing you to use the same name and password to sign in (although you will still be required to enter billing information to make purchases on those sites). In addition, unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials from IMAGEZOO, we may notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or other information that may be of interest. (See Opting Out section, below.)

They allow IMAGEZOO, and certain of its subsidiaries and third party content providers, to recognize information, such as the Lightboxes you have created, and assist in determining what content is best suited to your needs. Cookies also allow you to retrieve previous image search results, access Lightboxes with ease and view your previous invoices. Most browsers allow you to decline cookies, but if you elect to do so, these pages may not display properly. You are free to delete cookies after your session, and your browser should contain instructions on how to do this.

If you did not opt out when you registered, and later decide that you are not interested in receiving this information, you can opt out at any time by sending an email to info@imagezoo.com. Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional material from IMAGEZOO, you still may receive such material from our, third party content providers, affiliates and other parties to whom we provide your information in the course of doing business, as explained above.
