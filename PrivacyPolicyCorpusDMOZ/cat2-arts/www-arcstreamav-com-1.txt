Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Websites or Services. The following sets out how ArcStream AV uses different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookies’ settings: Required CookiesRequired cookies enable you to navigate the Company’s Websites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Websites and using ArcStream AV Services.Managing SettingsBecause required cookies are essential to operating the Company’s Websites and the Services, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.Functionality cookiesFunctionality cookies allow the Company’s Websites and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.  These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of ArcStream AV’s Websites and Services after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. Managing SettingsTo manage the use of functionality cookies on this Website, or to opt out of their use, click "Cookie Preferences" in the footer of this page. Note that opting out may impact the functionality you receive when using ArcStream AV's Websites and Services. To learn more about how to control cookies using your browser settings click here. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.  Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other DataAs is true of most Websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer our Websites and Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company’s Web sites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, ArcStream AV uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Websites. ArcStream AV also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features. Social Media Features and Single Sign-onThe Company’s Websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features. ArcStream AV also allows you to log in to certain of our Websites and Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. Do Not TrackCurrently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. ArcStream AV does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. ArcStream AV takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. 5. Public forums, refer a contact, and customer testimonialsArcStream AV may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Websites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. ArcStream AV is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform contacts about the Company’s Websites and Services. When using the referral program, the Company requests the contact’s name and email address. ArcStream AV will automatically send the contact a one–time email inviting him or her to visit the Company’s Websites. ArcStream AV does not store this information. ArcStream AV posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Websites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. ArcStream AV obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials. 6.
