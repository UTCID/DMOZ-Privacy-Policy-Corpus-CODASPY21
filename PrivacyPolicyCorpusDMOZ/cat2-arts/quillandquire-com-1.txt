Advertising
In addition to featuring display advertising (like banner ads), quillandquire.com also occasionally publishes stories or parts of stories that were paid for by and produced with advertising clients—what we call “client-directed content,” and which other publications variously call “custom content,” “branded content,” “native content,” or “sponsored content.” Any quillandquire.com story or part of a story that was created at the behest of an advertising client, was provided by them, or was otherwise produced with their input is marked by a button accompanying that content that features that client’s logo and name alongside the words “Brought to you by.”
