We believe our mission is best fulfilled when we embrace and promote understanding of the diversity in our community as both value, and a practice. For WGVU at GVSU, diversity, and inclusion includes four distinct attributes:• Inclusiveness – It is essential that we embody, respect, and value diversity that reflects our community and to create opportunities that embrace these differences, including ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, philosophical viewpoint, and socio-economic background.• Perspective – We articulate and analyze different perspectives so our viewers, listeners, and users can make up their own minds. We always encourage a fair, open, and civil dialogue.• Geography – It is important to note that while we directly serve the west and southwest Michigan area, with today’s expanding digital media, our community can be served anywhere in the world.• Age – Our viewers, listeners, and users range in age from young children to seniors. We recognize and build upon this age diversity by finding new and exciting ways to preserve our existing audience while attracting new people to our content.Goals:To that end, WGVU has set the following diversity goals:• To recruit and retain a diverse workforce that is representative of our community.• To provide equal opportunity in employment.• To educate our management and staff annually in best practices for maintaining an inclusive and diverse environment for all persons through workshops and seminars at Grand Valley State University.• To assist in developing a more diverse future workforce with professional skills in the broadcasting/media industry by recruiting candidates for WGVU internship opportunities by participating in minority or other diversity-based job fairs.• To work with our community through the Shaping Narratives initiative to further develop partnerships and community activities of importance.Related Resources:By taking advantage of the additional resources offered by Grand Valley State University, WGVU Public Media is proud to utilize, endorse, and implement the following:• GVSU’s Statement on Diversity and Inclusion: http://www.gvsu.edu/affirmativeactionstatement.htm• GVSU’s Division of Inclusion and Equity: http://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/• GVSU Office of Multicultural Affairs: http://gvsu.edu/oma/ Annual Diversity Reports:WGVU publishes a yearly Diversity and Inclusion report detailing the hiring and outreach practices during the preceding year.
