We value the trust of those we deal with, and of the public, and recognize that maintaining this trust requires that we be transparent and accountable in how we treat the information that you choose to share with us.In support of our work encouraging a national writing community, the Writers’ Trust gathers and uses personal information during the course of our various projects and activities.
