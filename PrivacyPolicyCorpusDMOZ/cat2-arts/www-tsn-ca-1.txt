Subscriptions purchased on a monthly basis are billed each month until you cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 26. If you have purchased a subscription for a fixed number of months (for example 6 months), for users who are not resident in Quebec, your subscription will automatically renew for a new subscription term (for example, a second 6 month term) unless you cancel your subscription before the end of your current subscription term. If you are a resident of Quebec, and if you have purchased a subscription for a fixed number of months (for example 6 months) your subscription will automatically renew for an indefinite period, billed monthly, (i.e. it will become a month to month subscription) unless you cancel your subscription before the end of your current subscription term, or inform us that you would like to renew for an additional fixed term subscription. In either case, we will provide you with notice of the renewal. If you cancel your subscription rather than renew, cancellation will take place as described in Sections 6(c) and 26. Your failure to cancel your subscription during the current term will result in the renewal of your subscription in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
Please note that the foregoing recurring billing and renewal provisions do not apply to any subscriptions that do not automatically renew. For such subscriptions, the Subscription Fees will be charged on a one-time basis at the time of purchase and the offering will automatically expire at the end of the prescribed subscription term.
In all cases, the applicable taxes will depend upon your location. If your credit card payment is declined, you acknowledge that you will no longer be able to access and use the Service. Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts on the website and payments hereunder are in Canadian dollars.
(c) No Refunds: All Subscription Fees are non-refundable. We will not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods or unwatched Content. If you cancel your subscription to the Service in accordance with Section 26, you will not be refunded or credited any portion of your last paid Subscription Fee (plus applicable taxes). Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period, at which point your subscription will terminate.
(d) Authorized Distributors: Without limiting Section 5, if you registered for the Service through an Authorized Distributor, please consult with such Authorized Distributor for the terms and conditions applicable to your subscription, including your subscription fee, payment terms, and the availability of credits or refunds.
