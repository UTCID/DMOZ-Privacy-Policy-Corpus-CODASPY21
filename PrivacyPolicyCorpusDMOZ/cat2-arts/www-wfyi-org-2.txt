WFYI Online Privacy Policy
WFYI, and all of its affiliated websites, adhere to the strict policy of protecting your privacy. This means ensuring that all of your personal information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) is kept out of the hands of a third-party. Rest assured, your information is safe with us.
Gathering and Use of Information
We do not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you give to us voluntarily.
In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide personal information. This could be in connection with the following:
contest or sweepstakes registration
subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)
requests for membership information
online transactions at WFYI.org
content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
If you choose not to provide personal information, you may be prevented from participating in certain activities which require this information (contests, for example).
WFYI may use your personal information for activities explained above or for internal marketing and promotional purposes.
WFYI will not rent, sell, or share your e-mail address.
WFYI will not rent or sell your personal information to third parties.
WFYI member postal addresses are exchanged with other carefully screened, local, not-for-profit, non-political, arts or cultural organizations (museums, theaters) that are likely to be of interest to WFYI members. This information is made available for single postal mail use only. This is the only case where such information is provided to third parties.
Allowing WFYI to share your postal address is another way to support WFYI. When WFYI shares this information with these carefully screened organizations, WFYI receives member addresses from these organizations in exchange. This enables WFYI to mail membership information and invitations to potential supporters of WFYI. Should you not wish to participate in such exchanges, please email membership@wfyi.org and state, "Do not exchange my name and postal address."

WFYI Kids Privacy Policy
For Parents and Caregivers of WFYI Kids:
For over 40 years, you have trusted us to provide responsible and quality content for children. As your child learns to use the Internet as an educational tool, this trust becomes even more important to you, and to us. We believe the following promises will improve the safety, value, and enjoyment of your child's visits to our Web site and our affiliated Web sites.
We will not collect personally identifiable information from your child without verifiable parental consent.
If your child sends us an e-mail with a question or comment, or enters one of our contests, we will respond using his or her e-mail, but will not store it for future communications without verifiable parental consent.
If we know that your child is under the age of 13, we will collect your permission offline (by postal mail, fax, or phone) before we mail any prizes or share your child's personal information with anyone else.
If your child submits stories, artwork, comments, or any other materials to us which is posted on our web site, he or she will be identified only by first name, age, city, and state.
We also promise to help children, their families, and communities find the information they need to use the Internet safely and responsibly.
When a WFYI Kids page is partially funded by outside sponsors, we will mark any underwriter logos with a "sponsored by" tag. We select our underwriters carefully, to ensure that the company's products and services fit WFYI standards. WFYI Kids pages will not contain advertisements promoting e-commerce or direct links to e-commerce.
Because we cannot ensure that links to outside sites follow our safety or privacy guidelines, we encourage adults and children to discuss these choices together. We are not responsible for the content, safety, or privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.
