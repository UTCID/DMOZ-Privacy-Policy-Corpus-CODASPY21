help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited. They also
allow you to personalize your pages, and optimize your experience at our sites.

which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. This
information helps us figure out which of our web features are highly successful
and which sites might need improvement. You can disable cookies on your

them. Disabling cookies may prevent you from properly using or accessing the Services.Session IDs:"Session IDs" allow us to identify a particular
user across multiple web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within
your cookie file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if The user's internet browser program does not support cookies

parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that
helps us understand and analyze the experience of

customize your future visits and improve the Services. For example, we capture
data on the type of browser used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95
vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has them turned on
or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get to
the Services). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on
sites and pages within the Services. Please keep in mind that none of this
information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this
information to internal staff at Lucy MediaBanner Ads:The Services may include the use of ad banner partners for
the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages.

to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. Lucy Media is
not responsible for the collection of these cookies and is not responsible for
the actions of the ad service providers. Lucy Media does not sponsor, endorse
or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on the Services.These companies may use information (not including your
