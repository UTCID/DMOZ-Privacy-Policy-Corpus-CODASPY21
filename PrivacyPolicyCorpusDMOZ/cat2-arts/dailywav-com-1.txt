Privacy Policy
Just some info about what I do and do not keep in terms of cookies and emails...
I do not sell anyone's email address. If you've emailed me, depending on the content, I might email you back letting you know a request is going to be put online, thanking you for a PayPal donation, things like that. So since I really don't keep anyone's email address except for these situations, I don't have any sort of list to even sell out to any 3rd party (and even if I did keep a list, trust me, I hate email spam as much as you do and would never sell addresses to anyone).
I do use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit my website (Google Ads). These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here. Google has recently been using the DoubleClick DART cookie when serving ads (since they bought DoubleClick awhile back). You can find out more info on the DoubleClick cookies/privacy statements by following this link. By going to those two links, you can opt-out of the Google and DoubleClick cookies.
The Daily .WAV does use session cookies to be able to "remember" a search you just did, etc.
