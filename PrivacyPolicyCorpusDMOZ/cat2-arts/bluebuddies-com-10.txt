What is All Your Smurf Are Belong to Smurf?
All Your Smurf are Belong to Smurf (aka The $20,000 Zig) is a parody of the "All Your Base are Belong to Us" fad. "All Your Smurf" is a Flash animation which features characters from the videogame "Zero Wing" along with Papa Smurf playing the $20,000 Pyramid (a 1980s gameshow). The animation parodies both "Zero Wing" and The Smurfs.
Who wrote the All Your Smurf animation?
"All Your Smurf Are Belong to Smurf" is a Pancakes House production.
What does "All Your Base are Belong to Us" mean?
The videogame "Zero Wing" features some very horrible Japanese to English translations. The translations are so terrible, yet funny, that they inspired a cult following. "All your base are belong to us" is actually a line of text from the "Zero Wing" game itself.
