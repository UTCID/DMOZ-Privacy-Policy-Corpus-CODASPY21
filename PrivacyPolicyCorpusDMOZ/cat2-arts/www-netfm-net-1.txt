Privacy policy
This
statement sets out NetFM's policies relating to
your personal information. It applies to your
conduct on the NetFM Website (the "Website").
These policies are in addition to NetFM's general
Terms of Use governing the Website and should be
read in conjunction with such Terms of Use.
Please
note that separate policies apply to the use of
sites that are available through the Website but
are not operated by NetFM directly.
YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT
NetFM
recognises that your privacy is very important to
you and that you have a right to control your
personal information. We know that providing
personal information is an act of trust and we
take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit
consent to act otherwise, the following policies
will govern how NetFM handles your personal
information and safeguards your privacy.
PRIVACY
STANDARDS
NetFM
is committed to protecting your personal
information and giving you choice in who can use
your personal information and how it can be used.
We believe that our privacy policy represents
industry best practice.
NetFM
is already committed to complying with the
voluntary National Principles for the Fair
Handling of Personal Information developed by the
Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner in 1998
[see the Australian
Privacy Commissioner's
website]. NetFM will comply with any laws
introduced to strengthen protections for
consumers' privacy.
COLLECTING
YOUR INFORMATION
NetFM
will not collect or monitor any personal
information about you without your consent unless
we believe it is necessary:
Because
it is required by law.
1. To
provide you with a service which you have
requested.
2. To
implement our terms of service.
3. To
protect the rights or property of NetFM, any
NetFM user, or any member of the public.
4. To
lessen a serious threat to a person's health or
safety.
You may
provide NetFM with information directly, such as
through subscribing to email lists or identifying
yourself when using particular services. The
amount of information we collect about you depends
on how you use the Website. The only personal
information we collect is what you tell us about
yourself, for example by subscribing to the
Website , email updates on various upcoming live
events.
NetFM
uses cookies to help maximise your enjoyment of
our Website. Cookies in and of themselves do not
personally identify users, although they do
identify a user's browser. Please see further
information on how we use cookies below.
NetFM
uses a membership system that gives you the option
of enjoying enhanced services on our Website.
Again, any changes in how we use your personal
information will only occur with your consent.
Any
further collection of your personal information
than that explained above will only occur with
consent from you. NetFM only collects information
from your use of our Website and not from other
organisations.

keep improving our Website.
Cookies
in and of themselves do not personally identify
users, although they do identify a user's browser.
The cookies simply operate as a unique identifier
which help us to know what our customers find
interesting and useful on our website, almost like
a continuing questionnaire.
We do
not link this information back to other
information that you have provided to us. NetFM
does not store any information inside cookies.

will not use or disclose any information about you

5. To

safety.
NetFM
and its affiliates recognise the trust you place
in us when you give us personal information. In
order to operate the website or deliver a service

date. Your information is stored on secure servers
that are protected in controlled facilities. In

obliged to respect the confidentiality of any
personal information held by NetFM.
However,
NetFM will not be held responsible for events
arising from unauthorised access to your personal

You can
also play an important role in keeping your
personal information secure, by maintaining the
confidentiality of any password and accounts used
on the NetFM website. Please notify us immediately
if there is any unauthorised use of your account
by any other Internet user or any other breach of
security.

control of NetFM, and we are not responsible for
the conduct of companies linked to our website.

other website, we advise you to examine the terms
and conditions of using their websites.
FUTURE
CHANGES

commitment to make NetFM Australia's leading
Internet Radio Website means that we are
constantly adding new features to the Website.

of this, from time to time, our policies will be
reviewed and may be revised. NetFM reserves the
right to change its privacy policy at any time and
notify you by posting an updated version of the
policy on its website.
