American Songwriter Annual Song Contest Terms and Conditions
How To Enter
An entry fee of $25 payable digitally to American Songwriter is required with each entry. By entering, you agree that this entry fee is necessary to cover the processing and administration of the contest. You may enter as many songs as you’d like, and each entry requires a $25 fee. Only valid and public URL links will be accepted. Please double-check URL links before entering. American Songwriter is not responsible for issuing refunds based on broken or otherwise invalid links. We are not accepting MP3 files. You may enter a variety of recording styles, including demos, worktapes and
finished masters. We require the song to be clearly audible in the recording. This is a song contest, based on lyrical and melodic values, not a singing contest. Songs will be evaluated based on lyrics, melody, and various other musical considerations. Songs WILL NOT be evaluated on recording quality, vocal prowess, or other similar values. We simply require that the recording clearly presents the song in its fullest light. There must be musical accompaniment to the lyric and melody. A cappella recordings are prohibited. You may enter online only, via americansongwriter.com. Refunds WILL NOT be issued under any circumstances.
Eligibility
The Contest is open to any amateur songwriter or band. American Songwriter broadly defines an amateur songwriter or band as an individual or entity whose personal income is not primarily from music-related sources (i.e. songwriting royalties, artist royalties, merchandise sales, live performances, synchronization licenses, record label advances, etc.). Conflicts of interest: Employees and independent contractors of American Songwriter and their immediate families, immediate families of the judges panel, or employees of sponsors (see section below) are not eligible to enter. In addition, immediate families of employees, contractors, sponsors and the judges panel cannot be a co-writer or producer on a song submitted. If a song is found to be in violation, American Songwriter will refund the submission fee. By submitting, you are agreeing that you are an amateur as described above and that you are not employed by or affiliated with any of the contest sponsors and that you have not received a W-2 or 1099 from Savage Media Holdings, LLC or ForASong Media, LLC in the past two years. You represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your entry to the Contest does not violate any applicable law or regulation. If you are under 18 years of age, however, you must have permission and clearance to enter the Contest from your parent or legal guardian. Entry of the Contest is void where prohibited. First, second, and third place contest winners are notified by email address or phone number. If the chosen winners do not respond to American Songwriter’s notifications within seven (7) days, American Songwriter reserves the right to contact runner-ups and/or honorable mentions for the receipt of the First Place prize. International winners must pay any and all customs fees for delivery of prizes.
Judging
This Contest is a talent and skilled-based business event. All entries are judged based on the merit of the overall songs (lyric & melody). All entries will be first screened by one or more professional songwriters and/or employees of American Songwriter. The Top 35 songs will be posted/featured on AmericanSongwriter.com on November 16, 2020. All contest entrants should stay informed of the selection process in November via AmericanSongwriter.com site updates and by joining American Songwriter’s daily e-newsletter, The Daily Co-Write. The 35 finalists are then turned over to a group of industry professionals (see Judges Panel) who will then select the Top 3 Winners and 10 Honorable Mentions. The Top 3 will be notified via e-mail and phone, Honorable Mentions will be notified via email, and all results will be posted on AmericanSongwriter.com and announced via The Daily Co-Write on December 1, 2020. Entrants who did not place in the Top 3 or 10 Honorable Mentions will not receive individual notifications but will be notified via email.
