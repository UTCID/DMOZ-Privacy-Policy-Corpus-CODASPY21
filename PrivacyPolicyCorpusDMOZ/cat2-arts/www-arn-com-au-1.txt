7. ARN Right to Reject Advertising or Material
ARN may in its absolute discretion: (a) at any time and without notice to the Client cancel, reject or refuse to broadcast, communicate or publish or continue broadcasting, communicating or publishing any Advertising or Material without providing any reason for such rejection or refusal at any time prior to, or after, publication of the Advertising, provided this right will not be unreasonably exercised; (b) refuse to accept any scripts provided by the Client for live reads which are not approved by ARN and its on-air talent.
ARN shall have no liability to the Client in respect of any action taken pursuant to this Clause 7. ARN may at its sole discretion provide the Client with credit which may be used against an alternate campaign subject to availability, or a refund in respect Fees paid for Advertising not broadcast as a result of ARN exercising its discretion not to broadcast pursuant to this Clause 7.
8. Broadcast and Publication Times
(a) All Advertising times not already specified in the Advertising Order must be booked at least 7 Business Days before the scheduled Start Date specified in the Advertising Order. (b) Subject to availability and these Terms and Conditions, ARN will use reasonable endeavours to broadcast the Advertising in any specified times or periods set out in the Advertising Order or its attachments or requested in accordance with Clause 8(a). (c) The Client acknowledges and agrees that ARN may at its discretion vary the placement and formatting of Advertising. Such variations by ARN will not in any way affect the obligation of the Client to pay the Fees.  (d) Without limiting the above and subject to Clause 9, if Advertising is broadcast or published outside of any times or periods or other manner identified in the Advertising Order, or is aired otherwise than in accordance with the Advertising Order then ARN may in its discretion, subject to availability, offer the Client alternate placements on the following basis: (i) to be considered for alternate placement the Advertising must be broadcast more than 20 minutes outside of the intended advertising timeslot; (ii) alternative placement will not be considered if the Advertising is broadcast while the scheduled show is still on air; and (iii) any alternate placements will be offered on a like for like, one for one basis,
No refund will be available.
9. RadioMATRIX Application
(a) If the Client is an advertising or other media buying agency and has an agreement with DBM Systems Pty Ltd (DBM) for access to the RadioMATRIX Application for delivery of booking confirmations to Client, then this Clause 9 will apply to the pre-review of bookings data by the Client. (b) Unless notified in writing by ARN that ARN no longer has an agreement in place with DBM in respect of the provision of bookings data, then all booking data confirmations will be provided to Client via the RadioMATRIX Application. Paper bookings data will be available on request by exception from DBM or ARN in the event of a failure of the RadioMATRIX Application. (c) Pursuant to Client’s agreement with DBM, DBM will be obliged to provide Client each night with a file including all bookings holdings data for the Client with ARN (Holdings File). If the Holdings File is not received on any one business day, Client must notify DBM by 11.00am the same day.(d) Holdings is considered the final confirmation from ARN. It is the Client’s sole responsibility to check Holdings and notify ARNof any errors within 2 business days of making the booking and subsequently on weekly basis throughout the period of the campaign. Any errors (included misplaced, duplicated or incorrectly rated bookings) for spots or non-spot charges that appear in Holdings that are not queried by the Client with ARN will not attract a credit and Client will be required to make full payment for advertising published, communicated or broadcasting in accordance with Holdings. In the event ARN adjusts a booking prior to broadcast in accordance with this clause 9(g), they will advise the Client of the changes to be reflected within Holdings with sufficient time prior to the broadcast to allow the Client to review and agree on those changes.(e) For the avoidance of doubt, failure of the Client to undertake the above reviews and notify any bookings discrepancies to ARN within the specified timeframes will negate any obligation on ARN to credit, make good, cancel, move or otherwise recompense the Client for any spot which has been confirmed by way of the Holdings Files provided to the Client.
10.

Payment of Fees by credit card will only be accepted by prior arrangement with an authorised representative of ARN. “Fees” means the fees specified in an Advertising Order or otherwise as calculated in accordance with ARN’s standard Advertising rates and includes any agreed fees payable in respect of Creative Services.
11. Advertising Rates The Rates for all Advertising are set out in the Advertising Order or if not set out in the Advertising Order will be based on ARN’s applicable rates for the Client as determined by ARN from time to time.
12. Cancellation or Amendment of Advertising (a) The cancellation or amendment by the Client of any Advertising later than 28 days prior to the scheduled Start Date will incur a cancellation fee of 100% of the Fees and any other amount that would be payable by the Client if the Advertising had been broadcast or published in accordance with the Advertising Order.  (b) If Advertising is cancelled or amended with less than 28 days notice but more than 14 days notice from the Start Date, ARN may, at its sole discretion, by arrangement with the Client, provide the Client with a delete and charge credit equal to the amount of the cancellation fee. A delete and charge credit will not be effective until the applicable cancellation fee has been paid in full by the Client.  (c) A delete and charge credit will expire 3 months after the date the relevant Advertising was cancelled and will not entitle the Client to any refund or other payment but may be utilised on unfilled broadcast times, subject to ARN’s discretion to give higher priority to other customer’s actual or anticipated Advertising orders.
13. Failure to Pay Fees If full payment of Fees is not received by ARN on or before the date that such payment is due, or if the Client commits or is the subject of an Insolvency Event, ARN may at its sole election and discretion: (a) cancel any credit terms provided to the Client and require immediate payment in full of all Fees; (b) immediately and without notice, suspend the broadcast of any Advertising or suspend or cancel all Advertising orders of the Client and terminate any agreement in relation to Advertising not yet broadcast or Creative Services not yet provided; (c) require cash pre-payment for any further Advertising or Creative Services; (d) impose interest at the rate of 2% (two percent) above the Reserve Bank’s 90 day Bill Rate on all sums that remain unpaid until full payment is received;  (e) commence legal proceedings against the Client for recovery of any outstanding amounts; (f) recover from the Client all costs incurred by ARN in the recovery of any amount owed by the Client including any debt recovery or legal costs on a full indemnity basis; and (g) take any such other steps as ARN considers appropriate or necessary to recover the Fees. Client must notify ARN as soon as practicable of any change, event, fact or circumstance affecting the Client which may impact on its ability to pay the Fees.  The Client agrees to provide to ARN all information as is reasonably requested by ARN to determine the credit worthiness of the client and its suitability and ability otherwise to meet payment of the Fees.
