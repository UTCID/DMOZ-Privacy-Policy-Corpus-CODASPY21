ESP Legal Notifications: Terms of Use
10 Dec 2020
Updated:
ESP.ORG Terms of Use Policy
Welcome to ESP.ORG. We hope you find it useful. By accessing
our servers, websites, or content therefrom (together, "ESP.ORG"), you
agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU"), last updated 21 December 2016.
The fine print of this TOU is given below.
LICENSE. If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable,
nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable license to access ESP.ORG in
compliance with the TOU; unlicensed access is unauthorized. You agree
not to license, distribute, make derivative works, display, sell, or
"frame" content from ESP.ORG. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited,
worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, perform,
display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.
USE. You agree not to use or provide software (except for general
purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed
by us) or services that interact or interoperate with ESP.ORG, e.g. for
downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile
use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited,
as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, and/or spam postings/email.
MODERATION. You agree we may moderate ESP.ORG access and use in our sole
discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion,
delay, omission, verification, and/or access/account/license
termination. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are
not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to
moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate,
or not.
SALES. You authorize us to charge your account for ESP.ORG fees. Unless
noted, fees are in US dollars; tax is additional. To the extent
permitted by law, fees are nonrefundable, even for posts we remove.
This is the scary part about TOU documents: all kinds of stuff can be
buried in the fine print.
DISCLAIMER. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND
OTHER CONTRACT PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS
AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS; NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE
RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.
To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to ESP.ORG, its
completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security
or reliability; (2) your access and use are at your own risk, and ESP.ORG
is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE"; (3) we are not liable for any
harm resulting from (a) user content; (b) user conduct, e.g. illegal
conduct; (c) your ESP.ORG use; or (d) our representations; (4) WE AND OUR
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES ("ESP.ORG ENTITIES"), DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES & CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; (5) ESP.ORG ENTITIES
ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR
GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR
WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.
CLAIMS. You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim")
arising out of or related to the TOU or your ESP.ORG use is governed by
Washington ("WA") law regardless of your location or any conflict or
choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved exclusively by
state or federal court in Seattle, WA (except that we may seek
injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal jurisdiction of
said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year after it arose or
be forever barred; (5) not to bring or take part in a class action
against ESP.ORG Entities; (6) (except government agencies) to indemnify ESP.ORG
Entities for any damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising
from claims related to your ESP.ORG use; (7) you are liable for TOU
breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or
indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (8) to pay us for
breaching or inducing others to breach the "USE" section, not as a
penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages
are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post,
email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected, and
$1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.
MISC. Users complying with prior written licenses may access
ESP.ORG thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is
the exclusive and entire agreement between us. If any TOU term is
unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If TOU translations
conflict with the English version, English controls. See Privacy
Policy for how we collect, use and share data.
ESP Quick Facts
ESP Origins
In the early 1990's,
Robert Robbins
was a faculty member at Johns
Hopkins, where he directed the informatics core of GDB
— the human gene-mapping database of the international human
genome project. To share papers with colleagues around the world, he
set up a small paper-sharing section on his personal web page. This
small project evolved into The Electronic Scholarly
Publishing Project.
ESP Support
In 1995, Robbins became the VP/IT of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, WA. Soon after arriving in Seattle, Robbins secured
funding, through the ELSI component of the US Human Genome Project, to
create the original ESP.ORG web site, with the formal goal of
providing free, world-wide access to the literature of classical genetics.
ESP Rationale
Although the methods of molecular biology can seem almost
magical to the uninitiated, the original
techniques of classical genetics are readily appreciated by one and
all: cross individuals that differ in some inherited trait, collect
all of the progeny, score their attributes, and propose mechanisms
to explain the patterns of inheritance observed.
ESP Goal
In reading the early works of classical genetics, one is drawn, almost
inexorably, into ever more complex models, until molecular explanations
begin to seem both necessary and natural. At that point, the tools
for understanding genome research are at hand. Assisting readers reach
this point was the original goal of The Electronic Scholarly Publishing
Project.
ESP Usage
Usage of the site grew rapidly and has remained high. Faculty began
to use the site for their assigned readings. Other on-line
publishers, ranging from The New York Times to Nature
referenced ESP materials in their own publications. Nobel laureates
(e.g., Joshua Lederberg) regularly used the
site and even wrote to suggest changes and improvements.
ESP Content
When the site began, no journals
were making their early content available in
digital format. As a result, ESP was obliged to digitize classic
literature before it could be made available. For many important
papers — such as
Mendel's original paper
or the
first genetic map
— ESP had to produce entirely new typeset versions of the works,
if they were to be available in a high-quality format.
ESP Help
Early support from the DOE component of the Human Genome Project was
critically important for getting the ESP project on a firm foundation.
Since that funding ended (nearly 20 years ago), the project has been
operated as a purely volunteer effort.
Anyone wishing to assist in these efforts should send an
email to Robbins.
ESP Plans
With the development of methods for
adding typeset
side notes to PDF files, the ESP project now
plans to add annotated versions of some classical papers to
its holdings. We also plan to add
new reference and pedagogical material.
We have already started providing
regularly updated, comprehensive
bibliographies
to the ESP.ORG site.

ESP FEATURES
Papers in Classical Genetics
The ESP began as an effort to share a handful of key papers
from the early days of classical genetics. Now the collection
has grown to include hundreds of papers, in full-text format.
Digital Books
Along with papers on classical genetics, ESP offers a collection
of full-text digital books, including many works by Darwin (and
even a collection of poetry —
Chicago Poems by Carl Sandburg).
Timelines
ESP now offers a much improved and expanded collection of timelines,
designed to give the user choice over subject matter and dates.
Biographies
Biographical information about many key scientists.
Selected Bibliographies
Bibliographies on several topics of potential
interest to the ESP community are now being
automatically maintained and generated on the ESP site.
