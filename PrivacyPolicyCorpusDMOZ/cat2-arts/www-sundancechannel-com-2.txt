TERMS OF USE
EFFECTIVE DATE: September 23rd, 2020
Welcome to AMC. Please read this Terms of Use Agreement (the “Terms”) carefully, as it establishes legally binding terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A PROVISION THAT GENERALLY REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
PLEASE SEE THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION FOR INFORMATION. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ONLY APPLIES TO SERVICES RENDERED IN THE UNITED STATES.
These Terms govern your use of all websites, applications, mobile applications, games, sweepstakes, contests, products and services owned and operated by AMC Networks Inc. and its United States-based affiliate and subsidiary companies (together, “AMC” or “we” and sometimes “us”) and anywhere else where these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Services”). These Terms apply whether you are accessing the Services using a personal computer, mobile device, gaming console or other equipment or device. These terms do not cover other services, websites or any content, features and activities accessible or made available by any third party, unless specifically stated.
The Terms include:
The terms and conditions in this document;
The Privacy Policy;
The Cookie Policy; and
Additional terms and conditions that we may provide in association with certain Services, such as certain promotional offers or rules for participation in certain activities (“Rules”), including contests and sweepstakes (“Promotions”).
The Terms apply to anyone who uses the Services (“User”, “you” or “your”), and people who simply browse the Services. If you access, use, visit, register for, or subscribe to the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree that you are bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms.
If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the Services.

These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State’s conflict of laws provisions.
Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Customers
IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND AMC (TOGETHER, THE “PARTIES”) AGREE TO SUBMIT EXCLUSIVELY ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SITE, THE SERVICES, THESE TERMS, OR ANY OTHER POLICIES OR OTHER TERMS INCORPORATED THEREIN (INCLUDING THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, ENFORCEABILITY, VALIDITY, OR RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING) (EACH, A “DISPUTE”) FOR RESOLUTION BY CONFIDENTIAL, INDIVIDUAL, BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR, AND NOT ANY FEDERAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL OR LOCAL COURT OR AGENCY, SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION, APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR FORMATION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS VOID OR VOIDABLE.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING ALL THRESHOLD ARBITRABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATING TO WHETHER THE TERMS ARE UNCONSCIONABLE OR ILLUSORY AND ANY DEFENSE TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WAIVER, DELAY, LACHES OR ESTOPPEL.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (I) YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO ARBITRATE A DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION; AND (II) YOU ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.
THE ARBITRATION WILL BE HELD IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.
IF THIS LOCATION IS NOT CONVENIENT FOR YOU, PLEASE LET US KNOW.
WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO DETERMINE A MUTUALLY CONVENIENT LOCATION.
ANY DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING THE FORUM FOR ARBITRATION WILL BE SETTLED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
DISPUTES WILL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN THE EVENT THAT ARBITRATION IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (I) THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE BROUGHT AND HEARD SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.
THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY PLEA OR DEFENSE THAT SUCH COURTS ARE NOT THE APPROPRIATE VENUE OR THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS.
