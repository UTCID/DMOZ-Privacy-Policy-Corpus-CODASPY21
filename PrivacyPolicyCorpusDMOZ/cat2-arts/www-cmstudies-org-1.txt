Bylaws & Policies
SCMS Accessibility StatementThe Society for Cinema & Media Studies is committed to providing access and reasonable accommodation in its services, programs, activities, education, and employment for individuals with disabilities.  SCMS encourages persons with disabilities to participate in its programs and activities. If you need an accommodation or have questions about the physical access provided by the conference facility, please contact our conference manager/ADA coordinator in advance of your participation or visit. We will use our best efforts to honor reasonable disability accommodation requests.  Please provide your accommodation request at least two weeks in advance of the conference to give us ample opportunity to work with the facility to address your concerns. SCMS Anti-Harassment Statement  As an association, the Society for Cinema and Media Studies is strongly committed to building
and supporting a robust scholarly and educational community built on the tenets of equity and
the free and civil exchange of ideas with fundamental respect for the rights, dignity, and value of
all persons (See SCMS Position Statement November 21, 2016). The standards of respect,
equity, and nondiscrimination should inform conduct whether in speech or act; whether in
formal, informal or social settings; whether in-person or remotely. Read the full statement here.SCMS Anti-Racism Statement  The Society for Cinema and Media Studies strongly condemns police violence and acts of hatred against African Americans across the United States. The deaths of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Sean Reed, and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police—and the killing of Ahmaud Arbery by a former police officer—are only just a few of the latest examples of the depths of cruelty and violence by those in power within the United States. These incidents are not isolated nor are they rare. While the brutality looks different country by country and region by region, as a global organization of scholars, we know that the scourge of racism is its own global pandemic.Read the full statement here. SCMS Bylaws

SCMS Policy and Politics
As a professional society that includes and welcomes diverse members representing a wide range of cultural and ideological perspectives, SCMS makes it a policy to refrain from making official statements of either support or condemnation on political issues that do not immediately concern film and media, and which might not indicate a position held by a majority of our membership. Any such statement would only be issued following a full discussion by the elected officers and representatives on the SCMS Board of Directors and, in appropriate circumstances, a vote of all SCMS members. The leadership of SCMS does not seek to restrict members from expressing their views, nor to restrict groups supported within SCMS from expressing collective views. However, we must clarify that these views cannot be identified as the views of SCMS and its membership as a whole. SCMS Position Statement
Issued November 21, 2016.  At this historical moment the Board of Directors of SCMS recognizes that the humanities and humanistic knowledge, on which cinema and media studies are still broadly based, are now more essential than ever.  We therefore pledge to maintain SCMS as an inclusive organization open to all individuals who share our field’s commitments to diverse and multiple national origins, races, ethnicities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, classes, abilities, migration statuses, and other expressions or categorizations of identity.  We understand that this commitment extends to our membership overall as well as to what we study. SCMS Privacy PolicySCMS' Privacy Policy was updated in June 2018. You can read it in full here (opens as a PDF).  Please note that if you choose to be a member of SCMS, we will add you to our mailing list for the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies (which arrives in hard copy four times a year) and to our email mailing lists for monthly news briefs and general correspondence. You may opt-out of any of these mailings on your profile page (Manage Profile --> Edit Bio, scroll to the bottom of the "Personal Information" section).
