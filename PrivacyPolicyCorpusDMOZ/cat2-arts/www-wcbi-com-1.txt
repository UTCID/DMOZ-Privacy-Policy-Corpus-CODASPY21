Miscellaneous
The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or End User’s actual state or country of residence. End User agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Washtenaw County, in the State of Michigan, for the resolution of all disputes arising from or related to these Terms of Service and/or his/her use of the Service. The Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of WCBI-TV’s successors and assigns. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by WCBI-TV. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect. The failure of WCBI-TV to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by WCBI-TV in writing. These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between End User and WCBI-TV with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding this subject matter. WCBI-TV can revise these Terms of Service at any time without notice by updating this posting, and End User agrees that their continued use of the Service after such revisions have been posted constitutes their acceptance of such revised Terms of Service. Neither party may assign or transfer this Agreement to any other person or entity without the prior written consent of the other party, (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided however that WCBI-TV may assign the Agreement to another entity: (i) owning a majority of its outstanding stock; (ii) into which it merges, or (iii) which acquires all or substantially all of its assets. The provisions of this Terms of Service are for the benefit of WCBI-TV and their contractors, information providers, service providers, licensors, employees, licensees and agents; and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly on its own behalf. Any acknowledgment of an e-mail or other communication from End User that is in any way inconsistent with, or adds to, the provisions of these Terms of Service is null and void. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify the provisions of these Terms of Service. WCBI-TV may authorize or allow its contractors and other third parties to provide to WCBI-TV and/or to End User services necessary or related to making the Service available and to perform obligations and exercise rights of WCBI-TV under these Terms of Service. Any obligations or duties which by their nature extend beyond the termination of these Terms of Service shall survive any expiration or termination of these Terms of Service. WCBI-TV and/or third parties may from time to time send e-mail messages to End User containing advertisements, promotions and other such information. WCBI-TV makes no representation or warranty with respect to the content of such email messages or any goods or services which may be obtained from such third parties, and End User agrees that neither WCBI-TV nor such third party shall have any liability with respect thereto.
