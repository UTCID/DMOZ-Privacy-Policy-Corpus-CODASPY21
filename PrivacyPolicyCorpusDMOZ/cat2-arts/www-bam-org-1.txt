Privacy Policy
Overview The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes the personal information we collect about you, the security measures we take to protect your information, the ways we use your information, and the limited situations in which we may share your information with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. We encourage you to read the complete privacy policy; use of BAM's family of websites
constitutes your acceptance of this policy.
Collection of Your Personal Information  A. Information you give us BAM will often request information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you purchase tickets, make donations to BAM, register for email newsletters or alerts, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact us with a question or suggestion, request postal mailings, or apply for employment. Personal information collected by BAM generally includes a home address, email address, phone number, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product or genre preferences; it may include other information as needed to provide a specific service you requested or as part of an online survey or promotion. We collect this information when you enter it on BAM websites or provide it voluntarily. You may remain anonymous to us if you choose to pay by cash in person at the Box Office.
B. Automatic information When you visit BAM's websites, we automatically collect website usage information, as well as information about your computer and Internet connection. This includes your computer's IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your Internet domain, and if you visit via a link from another website, the URL of the linking page. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique ID number, and it is not linked with personal information unless you choose to log in. We aggregate this usage information and use it to identify the levels and areas of interest in BAM and to improve and refine our websites, services, and security. We may perform (or have third parties perform) analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share aggregated, anonymous data with funders, sponsors, or agencies.
We use cookie technology to gain information that helps us improve the user experience and enhances the functionality of our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data sent by our websites and stored on your computer's hard drive that our site can read, and which helps us keep track of how you use our websites. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies by default but contain an option for you to disable the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you disable cookie acceptance, bear in mind that you will not be able to purchase tickets to BAM online. We do not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies via BAM's family of websites.
BAM uses electronic images known as web beacons to monitor the activity of our email messages. These web beacons allow BAM's email service provider to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that opened the email and what links were clicked within the email. With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
BAM uses remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that BAM allows third party vendors to show BAM’s ads on sites across the Internet. BAM and these third party vendors use first party cookies and third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a visitor’s past visits to BAM.org.
We employ third parties to perform functions like sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and processing credit card payments. These parties have access to personal information that is necessary to perform their functions, but they are contractually obligated not to use it for other purposes.
Security Used to Protect Your Information BAM employs the latest safeguards and technologies to protect your information:
Secure Web Servers BAM employs secure web servers hosted in a certified data center. A Network Solutions SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate is used for the secure encrypted exchange of data between your web browser and BAM.org using SSL encryption. Network Solutions Digital Certificates are trusted by over 99% of all browsers, applications, servers, and clients, including: Microsoft® Internet Explorer, Mozilla® Firefox, Google® Chrome, Konqueror (KDE), Opera and Apple® Safari.
Credit Card Processing Our transactional website is Payment Card Industry (PCI), certified by SecurityMetrics, which verifies that merchant credit card handling processes are in compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. Once BAM has received all required information from you via a web browser, the transaction is processed with your bank via a secure encrypted Internet connection. Our web servers do not retain any credit card numbers, but we do process your credit card information through a secure internal database.
Firewall BAM.org has redundant, dedicated firewalls that protect both its transactional system and the data passing through it.
