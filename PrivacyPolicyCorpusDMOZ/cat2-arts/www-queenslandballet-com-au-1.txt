Queensland Ballet will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting access to customer information databases, communicating this policy statement to all Queensland Ballet employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement.
When we contract with another company to market or advertise products or services on our behalf, we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting our customer information. We will enforce all privacy agreements we have with other companies.
We gather personal information from our customers so we can better develop our relationship with those customers. Occasionally, we seek customer comments on our products. These comments allow us to determine which products our customers should be made aware of based on their specific needs.
Customers, who believe they are receiving our communications in error or no longer desire to receive them, should inform us and we will remove those customers' names from our mailing lists. Queensland Ballet will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with customers.
We treat our customers as we ourselves would like to be treated.
