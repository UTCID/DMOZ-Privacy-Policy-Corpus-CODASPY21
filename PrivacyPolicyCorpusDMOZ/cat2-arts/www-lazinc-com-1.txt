Using your information
If you call us or make contact by email, we will follow up on your enquiry and see if there is a way in which we can help you. We keep a record of enquiries received, so that we know what we have said to whom.
The legal basis for processing this data is that we need to use your details to follow up with you. It is also legitimate for us to keep track of what we said to you so we can understand further business need and plan our strategy accordingly.
We need to use your details to enter into and perform contracts with you, as well as keeping track of what terms have been agreed.
Transfers of your data
We do not transfer or process data outside the EEA or other countries deemed to have inadequate protection of data by the EU.
Retention periods
For as long as we have a relationship with you or think we might want to buy products or services from you, or for the duration of a dispute with you.
Third parties
As a general principle, we will not transfer your personal data to third parties without your permission.
We also have a small number of companies providing services to us. These are our processors and we have confirmed that they all meet the requirements of the GDPR.
Technical security
All our laptops are full-disk encrypted, as are our phones and tablets
Our servers and desktop computers are protected by physical security
The ability to log on to all these devices is restricted to members of staff, each having their own unique log on credentials
Landline phone calls are not encrypted
If you have particular security requirements, please email us on privacy@lazinc.com to discuss how we can support you.
Call recording
We do not record telephone calls. This may change in the future: if it does, we will let you know.
Facebook Users
Facebook uses cookies to track visitors to our business page. These cookies are set even if you do not have a Facebook account. They will track your Internet activities on and off Facebook. Despite the fact that only Facebook has access to the data from these cookies, not us, by creating and maintaining a Facebook business page, we are deemed responsible for the cookies being set. We have no way to prevent these cookies being used. We want to be as transparent as possible so you are aware of the way your data is being used by Facebook.
Your rights
You have rights concerning your personal data. You are entitled to:
Request a copy of your personal data and information about our processing of it
Request that we delete information on you if we do not need to hold it
Request that we correct any personal data that we hold on you
Request that we stop processing your data, although we can still hold it (e.g. on a suppression list, so that we know not to call you again)
Request that we move your data to another organisation’s IT system electronically
You also have the right to withdraw your consent
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us on privacy@lazinc.com.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing with a supervisory authority. In the UK the supervisory authority is the ICO, whose details are here: https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/postal-addresses/
