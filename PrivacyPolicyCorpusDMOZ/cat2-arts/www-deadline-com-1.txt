BREAKING… Sony Pictures today announced its biggest movie year ever at the global box office, passing $4 billion for the first time in the studio’s history. Thanks in large part to Skyfall becoming the biggest 007 film of all time (not adjusted for inflation, higher ticket prices, or IMAX premiums.) This weekend, the 23rd James Bond actioner grabbed a global cume of $669.2M and passed the $599.2M worldwide total taken in by Casino Royale in 2006. The box office success of Skyfall helped to push Sony Pictures past its previous high $3.585B set in 2009. The announcement was made by Jeff Blake, chairman of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution for Sony Pictures. “Exceeding $4 billion globally is a true rarity in this industry and it’s an extraordinary accomplishment for all of us at Sony Pictures,” Blake said in a statement.

Besides Skyfall, contributing to the studio’s worldwide box office record this year was The Amazing Spider-Man ($754M), Men In Black 3 ($624M), and Sony Pictures Animation’s Hotel Transylvania ($283M) as well as strong performers Resident Evil: Retribution, Underworld: Awakening, The Vow, and 21 Jump Street. Right now the studio is ranked #1 in North American market share and had nine #1 films at the domestic box office with as of today totals $1.628B domestic and $2.4B overseas. That international box office figure is also a record for the studio. This year Sony Pictures has one more film on its release calendar, Zero Dark Thirty, from the Oscar-winning team behind The Hurt Locker, director-producer Kathryn Bigelow and writer-producer Mark Boal. It hits theaters in NYC and LA on December 19th.
Besides Sony Pictures, Skyfall is from Albert R. Broccoli’s Eon Productions and the newly reconstituted MGM Studios. All inworldwide, Eon/MGM/Sony expect the Sam Mendes-directed, John Logan-scripted, Daniel Craig-starring pic to make $800M.
