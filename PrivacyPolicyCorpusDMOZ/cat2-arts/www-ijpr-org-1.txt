Toward achieving this goal, JPR and the JPRF outline the following Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for this website.PRIVACY POLICYProtecting your privacy begins with a complete understanding of what information can be collected from you and how that information is used. Should you have any questions regarding your privacy and our policy after reading this document, please contact JPR for clarification at: jprinfo@sou.edu or call us during business hours at 541-552-6301.YOUR MEMBERSHIP INFORMATIONUpon your request, the JPRF will provide you with the current information (e.g., name, address, email, etc.) that we maintain about you through the most secure means available. Names, email addresses, telephone numbers, mailing addresses or other personal membership information will not be sold or traded to any other party.
