Spam Email and Use of Email Addresses:
We make every effort to minimize the amount of email correspondence you receive from us. We do not share or sell your email address to any third parties.
Site Security:
We employ the latest 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layering) encryption technology in our online shopping cart system. This is done to protect you from unauthorized use of the information you are sending to our server. To make sure you have the latest security features on your browser download and install the latest version of your favorite browser, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, Netscape Communicator or Mozilla Firefox.

Security Policy:
To ensure your safety and confidentiality in the shopping cart, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology: the industry standard for transferring sensitive information over the Internet. Our secure server software encrypts (scrambles) all of your personal information including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code that are securely transmitted over the Internet and can only be reassembled and read by the owner of the secured site.
