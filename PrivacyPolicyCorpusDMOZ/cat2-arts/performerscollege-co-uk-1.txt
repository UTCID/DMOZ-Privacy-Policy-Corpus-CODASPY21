“Personal data” or “personal information” means any information relating to an identified, or identifiable individual, such as name, identification number, location data or online identifier. It could also include one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the individual.
There are “special categories” of sensitive personal data that refer to data relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health conditions, sex life or sexual orientation, genetic data, and biometric data which require a higher level of protection.

Access to data:
You can ask us if we are keeping any personal data about you and you may request to inspect/have a copy, subject to requirements of the GDPR, of information we hold. This is called a Subject Access Request.
