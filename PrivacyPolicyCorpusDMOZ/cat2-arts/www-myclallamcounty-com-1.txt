We may collect the following types of information during your visit on our Site:

B. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
When you use any of the services on our Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These “server logs” as they are commonly referred to, may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (the IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are visiting the World Wide Web), browser type, browser language, and date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. Log information does not include personally identifiable information other than IP addresses.
We also may have links on our Site that are in a format that enables us to keep a record of whether any particular link has been clicked on.
Our Site collects information through other technical methods, including cookies and web beacons. When you visit our Site, we send cookies to your computer and use web beacons in order to track your trends and preferences. A cookie is a data text file that a web site sends to your browser and which is then stored on your system. Our Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by our Site. We cannot learn your e-mail address or any other personal information about you through a cookie. Rather, cookies are used to gather information about your use of the Site and how we can adapt our services to better suit your needs and preferences. Cookies identify you to our server, meaning that our Site will recognize you when you return to visit the Site. Many internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to inform you when a cookie is being sent. Web beacons are invisible images that are used to write cookies or access the cookies we have written previously or to access information about the page you are viewing for the purposes of recognizing returning users and analyzing patterns. A web beacon cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained in those cookies.

These third parties may place or recognize a cookie or web beacon on your browser. The information provided by these cookies and web beacons is used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and other sites tracked by these third parties. We do not have control over the practices of these third parties. The third parties do not receive or learn your e-mail address or other personal information through these technologies. We currently maintain relationships with Google Analytics and other entities to provide statistical and ad placement services. These parties may provide a way to opt out of their cookies and web beacons.

What do we do with the information we collect, and with whom is it shared?
We respect your privacy and do not share personally identifiable information about you or any Site visitor with third parties except within the scope of this Privacy Policy. Here are some of the ways in which your information may be used or shared with other parties:
Statistical and Aggregate Information. Some of the information that we collect is processed and analyzed in the form of aggregated statistics that track the types of websites users visit and the frequency with which they visit those sites. This statistical information does not include any information that personally identifies you or any user of the Site. The information is useful in creating a Site that reflects the preferences of our users, and we reserve the right to share such aggregated information with third parties to serve our business purposes. We also use non-personally identifiable demographic and preference information that we collect to allow targeted advertising and other content on our Site to be served according to the interests of our users.
Related Sites. Some of our services may be offered in connection with other websites that are not owned and/or operated by Radio Pacific Inc. Information you provide to us may be sent to those sites, and information that you provide to other related sites may be sent to us, in order to deliver the services you request. Any information provided to or in connection with a related site will be governed by that site’s privacy policy. You should become familiar with other sites’ privacy practices before providing us or them with any personal information for a service that would require us to provide them with any information about you. If you decide to opt out of any services on our Site for which you previously provided personal information to us and another site, you will need to contact any affiliated sites separately to request that they receive your opt out request as well, as it relates to information such affiliated sites retain.
Service Providers. We may have agreements with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and/or fulfillment services. These parties provide services that allow us to offer some of the features of the Site. If you choose to receive these services, information you provide in connection with that service may also be shared with the third party service provider. We require that these providers use the information they obtain solely to provide the service on the Site, unless noted at the time you sign up for the service. However, you should assume that the information provided to these service providers may also be governed by their privacy policies, and you should become familiar with such providers’ privacy practices prior to accepting the service and providing the information.
Required by Law. We reserve the right to disclose to law enforcement agencies user submissions or other personally identifiable information as follows:
– We may disclose user submissions or other personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order, warrant or a subpoena.
– We also may disclose user submissions or other personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or inquiry when it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or potential crimes, illegal activities or fraud, situations involving actual or potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Site, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
By reserving these rights, we do not assume any duty or responsibility to so report. We are not responsible or liable to any person or entity whatsoever for any loss, damage (whether actual, consequential, punitive or otherwise), injury claim, liability or other cause of any kind or character based upon the disclosure or nondisclosure of user submissions or other personally identifiable information pursuant to this Policy.

In the event that we sell our assets to another company or participate in a merger with another company, the information we have collected from you and other users of the Site may be transferred to the successor or purchaser in such transaction and accessible to such purchaser or successor.

First, when considering use of certain services provided by this Site, you can choose whether to share optional information during the registration process for the service offered on the Site.

What are the guidelines for children related to the Site?

If we cannot reasonably verify parental consent or the age of the party submitting information we reserve the right to refuse participation in the requested service or feature. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personally identifiable information to us without verifiable parental consent, the Site will immediately delete such information from our database. We will not disclose any child’s personally identifiable information without prior parental consent. Any withdrawal of parental consent must be provided in writing to us at
