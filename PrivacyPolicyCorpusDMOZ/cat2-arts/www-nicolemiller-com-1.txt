Terms & Policy
Kobra International, Ltd. dba Nicole Miller (“NM”) is the owner of and operates this web site ("NicoleMiller.com")(the "Web Site").
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE. YOUR USE OF THIS WEB SITE CONFIRMS YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ABIDE THEREBY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THIS WEB SITE.
• Products, Content and Specifications. All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described, depicted or offered for sale on this Web Site are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. NM makes all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of its products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system and NM cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on this Web Site at a particular time does not imply or warrant that the same products or services will be available at any other time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use, and purchase of any item on this Web Site; this does not apply to New Jersey residents. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.
• Shipping Limitations When an order is placed, it will be shipped to the address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on this Web Site. All purchases from this Web Site are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from this Web Site pass to you upon NM's delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.
• Accuracy of Information. NM attempts to ensure that information on this Web Site is complete, accurate and current. Despite NM's best efforts, the information on this Web Site may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. NM makes no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currentness of any information on this Web Site. For example, products included on the Web Site may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the Web Site. In addition, NM may make changes to information about price and availability without notice. While it is NM's practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute NM's acceptance of an order or NM's confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. NM reserves the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product. NM also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.
• Use of this Web Site. The Web Site design and all text, graphics, information, content, and other material displayed on or that can be downloaded from this Web Site are either the property of or used with permission by NM, are protected by copyright, trademark and other laws and may not be used except as permitted in these Terms and Conditions or with the prior written permission of the owner of such material. You may not modify the information or materials located on this Web Site in any way or reproduce or publicly display, perform, distribute or otherwise use any such materials for any public or commercial purpose. Any unauthorized use of any such information or materials may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, laws of privacy and publicity, and other laws and regulations. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and password and for restricting access to such information and to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.

Other trademarks, trade names and service marks used or displayed on this Web Site are the registered and unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks of their respective owners. Nothing contained on this Web Site grants or should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any trademarks, trade names, service marks or logos displayed on this Web Site without NM's written permission or the written permission of such third party owner. NM will protect and enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.
• Linking to this Web Site. Creating or maintaining any link from another web site to any page on this Web Site without NM's prior written permission is prohibited.

Any permitted links to this Web Site must comply will all applicable laws, rule and regulations.
• Third Party Links. From time to time, this Web Site may contain links to web sites that are not owned, operated or controlled by NM or its affiliates.

Neither NM nor any of NM's affiliates are responsible for any content, materials or other information located on or accessible from any other web site. Neither NM nor any of NM's affiliates endorse, guarantee, or make any representations or warranties regarding any other web site, or any content, materials or other information located or accessible from such web sites, or the results that you may obtain from using such web sites. If you decide to access any other web site linked to or from this Web Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.
• Inappropriate Material. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting on or through this Web Site any unlawful, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. In addition to any remedies that NM may have at law or in equity, if NM reasonably determines that you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions, NM may take any action it reasonably deems necessary to cure or prevent the violation, including without limitation, the immediate removal from this Web Site of the related materials. NM will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or subpoena requesting or directing NM to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.
• Gift Certificates. Gift certificates can only be redeemed for purchases made on this Web Site, and are not redeemable for cash. Any unused balance will be placed in the recipient's gift certificate account and is not transferable. If your order exceeds the amount of your gift certificate, you must pay for the balance with a credit card. NM is not responsible for lost or stolen gift certificates. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws, NM makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to gift certificates, including without limitation, any express or implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In the event a gift certificate code is non-functional, your sole remedy, and NM's sole liability, shall be the replacement of such gift certificate.

If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to you, and you might have additional rights.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing disclaimer(s) of warranties shall not apply to New Jersey residents.

You agree to pay in full the prices for any purchases you make either by credit/debit card concurrent with your online order or by other payment means acceptable to NM.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use, NM has the right to remove any User Communications that violate this policy or are otherwise objectionable, and it reserves the right to refuse service and/or terminate access without prior notice for any user who violates this policy or infringes the rights of others.
Unless specifically requested, NM does not solicit nor does it wish to receive any confidential, secret, or proprietary information from you through the Web Site, by e-mail, or in any other way.  Any information, creative works, demos, ideas, suggestions, concepts, methods, systems, designs, plans, techniques, or other materials submitted or sent to us will be deemed not to be confidential or secret, and will not be subject to and/or protected by NM's Privacy Policy.
