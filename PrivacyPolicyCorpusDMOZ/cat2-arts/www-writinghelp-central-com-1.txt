Privacy Policy - Writing Help Central
The privacy policy of WritingHelp-Central.com is very simple, as follows.
“If you provide your e-mail address and name when you sign
up for one of the free writing help or publishing-related courses that I offer,
that information will never be shared with any other company, institution, individual
or other entity.”
I DO NOT sell, rent, or loan my subscriber information to
any companies or individuals, EVER.
I DO send the occasional writing-related e-mail to all of my
opt-in subscribers when I have new writing-related or publishing-related
information to offer. Anyone receiving these occasional e-mails from me has the
option, within that message, to opt out and permanently remove their subscriber
information from my list(s).
So, if you were worried at all about whether I would share
your info with anyone, the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT!
If you came to this page to check out my Privacy Policy
before signing up for anything, you can now be secure in signing up for any of my
writing help courses at the following link:
