8. GDPR
Compliance Statement
Kyle Esplin respects and complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
Some of the key ways we comply with these regulations are:
Consent
We explain what you’re consenting to clearly and without ‘legalese’, and ask that you explicitly consent to contact from us.
Breach Notification
In the event of a breach we will notify affected users within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
Right To Access
Users can request confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. Further, we shall provide a copy of
the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format.
Right to be Forgotten
Once we have compared your (the subjects') rights to "the public interest in the availability of the data", we may delete your personal data where you have requested
this.
Data Portability
We allow you to receive the personal data concerning you, which we will provide in a 'commonly used and machine readable format' and you have the right to transmit
that data to another ‘controller’.
Privacy by Design
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, in an effective way, in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of
data subjects'. We hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of our duties (data minimisation), as well as limiting the access to personal data to those needing to act
out the processing.
