Digital Download FAQs
What is the quality of audio files made available for download?
Any of the following audio file types may be available:
MP3 320 kbps
WAV 16 bit 44.1 kHz
FLAC 16 bit 44.1 kHz
FLAC 24 bit 96kHz (some releases only)
MP3 and WAV are compatible with most commonly available playback applications.
FLAC offers the best audio quality to file size ratio, but is not supported by some players.
To use it you may need to source a specialised playback application.
Are there any limits on accessing my downloads?
You can download your digital purchases up to 10 times.
Can I download multiple copies of my purchased songs?
You can download a second copy of the files to a second computer/storage device of yours.
We guarantee that a second copy will be available to you for up to thirty days after the date of purchase.
I have used up my download limit and have still not managed to obtain my purchases.
As a last resort, contact
and we will sort it out for you.
What will appear on my transaction statement?
Your statement should show a transaction labelled "state51/Internet" on the date you purchased your download(s).
