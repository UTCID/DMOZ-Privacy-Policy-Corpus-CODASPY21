Fundraising and profiling
As a charity, the CBSO relies on donations from individuals to support its charitable purposes.

We also review whether existing donors may wish to provide further financial support.
To enable us to do this in an efficient, effective and focused way, and to ensure the requests we make are appropriate, proportionate and tailored, we may use publicly available information (collected either in-house or by third parties) to identify whether or not you are likely to wish to provide additional donations to the CBSO.
We do not allow third parties to use the data we provide them about you for other purposes.
The information that we may process includes publicly available information relating to your wealth (including house price values), whether you are a trustee of a charity or have previously donated to similar charities, or raised funds for charitable purposes, in addition to your interest in the arts.
We understand that not all of our audience members or donors will want us to carry out such processing and you are free at any time to ask us to stop doing this in respect of your data.
You can do this by contacting unsubscribe@cbso.co.uk. If you do this we will delete the information that we have collected about you for these purposes.
