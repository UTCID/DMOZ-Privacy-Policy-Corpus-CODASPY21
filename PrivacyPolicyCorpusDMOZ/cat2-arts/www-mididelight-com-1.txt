You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or MIDI Delight has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, MIDI Delight has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
