Terms of ServiceWelcome! This website is operated by Walden Media, LLC (“Walden,” “us,” “our,” or “we”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you are authorized to use our websites (which includes any website on which these Terms are posted, including www.walden.com, other sites accessible via subdomains, websites where these terms are posted, such as sites specific to our films, and mobile versions of any of these sites) (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”).
To the extent additional rules or guidelines affect your use of these Sites, those rules and guidelines (including our Privacy Policy) are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. By using any of our Sites, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should immediately stop using our Sites.
Description of Service
Our Sites provide information and educational materials related to our books and movies, as well as information about our partners, subsidiaries, related companies and sponsors, and other content we think would be of interest to you (collectively the “Content”). To the extent new services, Content or features are added to our Sites in the future, your use thereof is subject to these Terms.
Third-party Services and Content
Our Sites are intended primarily for informational purposes. We may offer links to websites, contests, or other materials hosted by third parties. These Terms do not govern your use of such features, Content or services provided by, or links to other websites that are owned and operated by, third parties. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of, or any Content located on or through, any third-party site, or any services provided by third parties. You further acknowledge that any reliance on representations and warranties provided by any party other than Walden will be at your own risk. You expressly agree to hold us harmless for any claims of damage arising from any Content, product or service provided by any third party. Your use of those third-party websites and services is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies posted on each site or service, and we encourage you to review those terms of use and privacy policies.
Additional Policies and Agreements
Our Privacy Policy describes the information we collect when you and others use any of our Sites, as well as how we use the information, and some of the steps we take to protect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy is part of these Terms. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to our use of your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
These Terms may be supplemented or amended by the terms of a “click-through” agreement between you and Walden. For example, special terms may apply for participation in certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes on our Sites. If special terms apply, you will be asked to expressly consent to them, for example, by checking a box or clicking a button marked “I agree.” The terms of any such “click-through agreement” will supplement and amend these Terms, but only with respect to the subject matter of the “click-through agreement.”
Some additional terms may be provided by third parties, with regard to information or services they offer on or through our Sites, so please take further precautions when agreeing to those terms. Please review any policies or terms that may apply to you if and when you, sign up for information that may be provided by a third party, enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, or visit other websites operated by third parties.

Dispute Resolution
Any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of our Sites or any products, services, or information you receive through our Sites, shall be submitted to confidential, binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California, pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration under these Terms may be joined with another arbitration related to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration requirement, with regard to any actual or potential violation of our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in the courts of Los Angeles, California, and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive all objections thereto. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
Governing Laws
The laws of the state of California and the United States govern these Terms and any claims arising out of or relating to use of the Sites, without giving effect to any choice of law rules. We make no representation that our Sites are appropriate, legal or available for use outside of the United States. With the exception of any matters subject to arbitration as described above, the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California will serve as the venue for any actions brought, or claims made, arising out of your use of our Sites.
Compliance with Laws
You assume all knowledge of applicable law and you are responsible for compliance with any such laws. You may not use the Site in any way that violates applicable state, federal, or international laws, regulations or other government requirements.

Modifications will become effective immediately upon being posted to our Site, without further notice to you. Your continued use of any of our Site after such modifications are posted constitutes your acknowledgement and acceptance of such modifications, and you may not amend these Terms.
Other Terms
If any provision of these Terms is determined by a court of law to be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions (and any partially-enforceable provision) shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum possible extent, and the invalid provision will be modified as necessary to make it valid and enforceable while as closely as possible reflecting the original intentions of Walden. You agree that these Terms and any other agreements referenced herein may be assigned by us, in our sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger or acquisition or otherwise. These Terms as supplemented by any “click-through agreements,” shall apply in addition to, and shall not be superseded by, any other written agreement between us in relation to your participation as a contributor to our Site.
You agree and understand that these Terms together with any other applicable click-through agreements you may have entered into regarding our Site, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Walden regarding your use of the Sites, and that any other prior agreements between you and Walden are superseded by these Terms.
Any failure by Walden to exercise its rights under these Terms or to enforce the terms hereof will not constitute a waiver of those rights.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of a Site or relating to these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
