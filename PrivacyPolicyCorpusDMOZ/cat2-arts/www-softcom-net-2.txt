Softcom Terms of Service
High speed internet service (the “Service”) will be provided to you (“you,” “your,” or “Customer”) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) and applicable law by Softcom Internet Communications, Inc. (“Softcom,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
We may change our prices, fees, the Service and/or the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the future. Unless this Agreement or applicable law specifies otherwise, we will give you thirty (30) days prior notice of any significant change to this Agreement. If, upon review of the changes to this Agreement you find the changes unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Service. However, if you continue to receive or use the Service after the end of the notice period (the “Effective Date”) of the change, this constitutes your acceptance of the changes. You may not modify this Agreement by making any typed, handwritten, or any other changes to it for any purpose, and any such changes made by you will not be valid. Only an executive of Softcom may authorize any modifications to this agreement.
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1) ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
YOU WILL HAVE ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT AND BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS IF YOU USE THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE INDICATE YOUR AFFIRMATIVE ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS.
2) CHARGES AND BILLINGS
a) Charges, Fees, and Taxes You Must Pay. You agree to pay all charges associated with the Service, including, but not limited to, installation charges, monthly service charges, add-on service charges (such as static IP service or E-mail service), service call charges, applicable federal, state, and/or local taxes and fees (however designated), regulatory recovery fees for federal, state, and/or local government fees or assessments imposed on Softcom, permitted fees and cost recovery charges, or any programs in which Softcom participates, including, but not limited to, public, educational, and governmental access, universal service, telecom relay services for the visually/hearing impaired, rights-of-way access, and programs supporting the 911/E911 system and any fees or payment obligations imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies for the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Service. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED FEES AND TAXES THAT BECOME APPLICABLE RETROACTIVELY. We will provide you with notice and an effective date of any change in our prices or fees, unless the change in price is related to a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees, or assessments, in which case we may elect not to provide notice except where required by applicable law.
i) Service price information is available at www.softcom.net.
ii) If you have agreed to a minimum term arrangement, your price for Service is as specified in the minimum term arrangement.
b) How We Will Bill You. Unless you are subject to a minimum term arrangement, Service is provided to you on a month-to-month basis. You will be billed monthly, in advance, for recurring service charges, equipment charges, and fees. YOU MUST PAY, BEFORE THE DAY WE THE INSTALL SERVICE, THE FIRST MONTH’S SERVICE CHARGES, EQUIPMENT CHARGES, ANY DEPOSITS, AND ANY INSTALLATION AND/OR ACTIVATION CHARGES. Your first bill may include pro-rated charges and/or credits from the date you first begin receiving Service, as well as monthly recurring charges for the next month and charges for non-recurring services you have received. We do not waive our rights to collect the full balance owed to us by accepting partial payment. We will apply the partial payment to the outstanding charges in the amounts and proportions that we determine.
c) Billing Dates. The billing due date for all accounts is the 1st day of each month, with a ten (10) day grace period to accommodate any circumstances which may prevent successful payment from being made on the 1st day of the month. Billing dates may not be changed on any account for any reason.
d) Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility. You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party service providers such as accessing online services or purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the internet that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us. You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of bank cards and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.
e) Automatic Recurring Payment. In order to establish service with Softcom, you must place and maintain a valid major bank card on file, which we will use for the collection of charges and fees on your account. It is your responsibility to make sure this information is kept current. All accounts have the ability to receive their statements electronically through the customer portal.
f) Payment by Bank Card or Check. If you use a bank card to pay for the Service, use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. If Softcom does not receive payment from your bank card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. If you make payment by check, you authorize Softcom to collect your check electronically. You agree that you may not amend or modify this Agreement with any restrictive endorsements (such as “paid in full”), or other statements or releases on or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by Softcom, and any such notations shall have no legal effect.
g) Our Remedies if You Pay Late or Fail to Pay.
i) Late or Non-Payments: Your account is considered late, and you may be billed fees, charges, and assessments related to late or non-payments if, for any reason:
(a) Softcom does not receive, in it’s office, payment for the Service on or before the payment due date, and/or
(b) you pay less than the full amount due for the Service, and/or
(c) your payment is dishonored, refused, returned, or otherwise not credited to Softcom by the due date.
Softcom is not responsible for postal mail which is late or not received due to no fault of Softcom. You assume all risks for any payments being sent to Softcom via postal mail.
ii) Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties: Softcom does not anticipate that you will fail to pay for the Service on a timely basis, nor do we extend credit to customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments. These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance:
(a) whether you will pay for the Service on a timely basis, if ever;
(b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay; and
(c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment.
iii) Collection Costs: If we use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection. These costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency’s fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and arbitration or court costs.  The actions of such collection agencies may cause derogatory information to be placed in your credit report(s).
iv) Suspension/Disconnect: If you fail to pay the full amount due for the Service then Softcom, at its sole discretion in accordance with and subject to applicable law, may suspend or disconnect the Service.
h) Reconnection Fees and Related Charges. If you resume the Service after any suspension, we may require you to pay a reconnection fee. If you reinstate the Service after disconnection, we may require you to pay an installation fee and/or service activation fee. These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees. Reconnection of the Service is subject to our credit policies, this Agreement and applicable law.
i) Dishonored or Returned Payments. Softcom reserves the right to charge you a fee for any payment dishonored by your financial institution to recover our costs in having such payment dishonored. If you dispute charges directly with your bank and your dispute results in a payment chargeback to Softcom, you will be charged a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) service fee. You will be responsible for any non-disputed charges beyond thirty (30) days.
j) Your Responsibilities Concerning Billing Questions. Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a billing credit, you must contact Softcom within thirty (30) days of the date on the bill. You waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within thirty (30) days.
3) REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT
We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Service, if you add equipment, upgrade the Service, or if you fail to pay any amounts when they are due. If we disconnect your Service or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the Service or for any Softcom Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).
4) CHANGES TO SERVICES
Subject to applicable law, we have the right to change the Service, equipment and rates or charges, at any time with or without notice. We also may rearrange, delete, add to, or otherwise change content, functionality, hours of availability, customer equipment requirements, speed, and upstream and downstream rate limitations. If we do give you notice, it may be provided on your monthly bill, as a bill insert, email, in a newspaper or other communication permitted under applicable law. If you find a change in the Service unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Service. However, if you continue to receive Service after the change, this will constitute your acceptance of the change.
5) ACCESS TO YOUR PREMISES AND CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT
a) Premises. You agree to allow us and our agents the right to enter your property at which the Service and/or equipment will be provided (the “Premises”) at reasonable times, for purposes of installing, configuring, maintaining, inspecting, upgrading, replacing and removing the Service and/or equipment used to receive any of the Service. You warrant that you are either the owner of the Premises or that you have the authority to give us access to the Premises. If you are not the owner of the Premises, you are responsible for obtaining any necessary approval from the owner to allow us and our agents into the Premises to perform the activities specified above. In addition, you agree to supply us or our agent, if we ask, the owner’s name, address, and phone number and/or evidence that the owner has authorized you to grant access to us and our agents to the Premises.
b) Customer Equipment. “Customer Equipment” means software, hardware or services that you elect to use in connection with the Service, such as, but not limited to, routers, modems, bridges, switches, computers, smartphones, tablets, streaming media players, televisions, or gaming consoles. You agree to allow us and our agents the rights to insert hardware in the Customer Equipment, send software, firmware, and/or other programs to the Customer Equipment and install, configure, maintain, inspect and upgrade the Customer Equipment and Softcom Equipment. You warrant you are either the owner of the Customer Equipment or that you have the authority to give us access to the Customer Equipment. If you are not the owner of the Customer Equipment, you are responsible for obtaining any necessary approval from the owner to allow us and our agents access to the Customer Equipment to perform the activities specified above. In addition, you agree to supply us or our agents, if we ask, the owner’s name, address and phone number and/or evidence that the owner has authorized you to grant access to us and our agents to the Customer Equipment to perform the activities specified above.
6) MAINTENANCE AND OWNERSHIP OF EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE
a) Softcom Equipment. “Softcom Equipment” means any equipment provided by Softcom such as wireless customer premises equipment, routers and any other equipment provided to you by us or our agents, excluding equipment purchased by you from Softcom and Customer Equipment. Softcom Equipment also includes any software, firmware, or other programs contained within Customer Equipment or Softcom Equipment. You agree that all Softcom Equipment belongs to us and will not be deemed fixtures or in any way part of the Premises, and you agree that you will have no ownership in any Softcom Equipment. You agree to use Softcom Equipment only for the Service pursuant to this Agreement. We may remove or change the Softcom Equipment at our discretion at any time the Service is active or following the termination of your Service. You acknowledge and agree that our addition or removal of or change to the Softcom Equipment may interrupt your Service. You may not sell, lease, abandon, or give away the Softcom Equipment, or permit any other provider of internet services to use the Softcom Equipment. The Softcom Equipment may only be used in the Premises. At your request, we may relocate the Softcom Equipment in the Premises for an additional charge, at a time agreeable to you and us, as long as the relocation request can be done within the technical limits of the Softcom Equipment and any Customer Equipment. You agree that you will not allow anyone other than Softcom or its agents to service the Softcom Equipment. We suggest that the Softcom Equipment in your possession be covered by your homeowners, renters, or other insurance. You will be directly responsible for loss, repair, replacement and other costs, damages, fees and charges if you do not return the Softcom Equipment to us in an undamaged condition.
b) Customer Equipment.
i) Responsibility: Softcom has no responsibility for the operation or support, maintenance, or repair of any Customer Equipment including, but not limited to, Customer Equipment to which Softcom or a third party has sent software, firmware, or other programs. You agree by using the Service, you are enabling and authorizing Softcom, its authorized agents and equipment manufacturers to send code updates to the Softcom Equipment and Customer Equipment at any time it is determined necessary to do so as part of the Service. Such code updates may change, add or remove features or functionality of any such equipment or the Service. Softcom’s minimum technical and other requirements for the Service are available through Softcom Technical Support. Whether a router or other device is owned by you or us, we have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to upgrade or change the firmware in these devices remotely or on the Premises at any time that we determine it necessary or desirable in order to provide Service to you in accordance with our specifications and requirements.
ii) Non-Recommended Configurations: Customer Equipment that does not meet Softcom’s minimum technical or other specifications constitutes a “Non-Recommended Configuration.” NEITHER SOFTCOM NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS WARRANT THAT A NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY INSTALL, ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE, AND/OR THAT A NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION WILL DELIVER THE SERVICE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERROR FREE, AND/OR THAT A NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION WILL WORK IN THE FUTURE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY SUCH INSTALLATION, ACCESS, OPERATION, OR USE COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT TO FAIL TO OPERATE OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT, YOU, YOUR PREMISES OR SOFTCOM EQUIPMENT. NEITHER SOFTCOM NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY SUCH FAILURE OR DAMAGE. Softcom reserves the right to deny you customer support for the Service and/or terminate Service if you use a Non-Recommended Configuration. Softcom Technical Support can provide the minimum technical specifications upon request.
iii) No Unauthorized Devices or Tampering: You agree not to attach, or assist any person to attach, any unauthorized device to our network, Softcom Equipment or the Service. If you make or assist any person to make any unauthorized connection or modification to Softcom Equipment or the Service or any other part of our network, we may terminate your Service and recover such damages as may result from your actions.
You also agree that you will not attach anything to the Inside Wiring, Softcom Equipment, or Customer Equipment, whether installed by you or us, which singly or together impairs the integrity of our network or degrades our network’s signal quality or strength.
You also agree that we may recover damages from you for tampering with any Softcom Equipment or any other part of our network or for receiving unauthorized Service. You agree that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate precisely the lost revenue resulting from your receipt of unauthorized Service or the tampering with Softcom Equipment or our network. You therefore agree to pay us as liquidated damages, the sum of $500.00 per device used to receive the unauthorized Service in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or unreturned Softcom Equipment or other equipment owned by Softcom, including any incidental costs. The unauthorized reception of the Service may also result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment.
c) Inside Wiring. You may install wiring inside your Premises (“Inside Wiring”), such as additional wiring and outlets, provided it does not interfere with the normal operations of our network. If you have us install Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service. Regardless of who installed it, we consider the Inside Wiring your property or the property of whomever owns the Premises. Accordingly, you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the Inside Wiring, unless you and Softcom have agreed otherwise in writing. (If you do not own the Premises, contact your landlord or building manager about the installation, repair or maintenance of Inside Wiring.) If you have us repair or maintain the Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service.
d) End User Software Licenses. Your use of the software, firmware, and other programs contained within the Softcom Equipment, and of any other software or plug-ins to such software distributed or used in connection with the Services shall comply with the terms of the applicable software license agreements. All such agreements are incorporated in this Agreement by reference. When this Agreement terminates, all end user licenses also terminate; you agree to destroy at that time all versions and copies of all software received by you in connection with the Services.
7) USE OF SERVICES
You will not use the Softcom Equipment at any time at an address other than the Premises without our prior written authorization. You agree and represent that you will not resell or permit another to resell the Service in whole or in part. You will not use or permit another to use the Softcom Equipment or the Service, directly or indirectly, for any unlawful purpose, including, but not limited to, in violation of any posted Softcom policy applicable to the Service. Use of the Softcom Equipment or Service for transmission, communications or storage of any information, data or material in violation of any U.S. federal, state or local regulation or law is prohibited. You acknowledge that you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of all persons who use the Softcom Equipment and/or Service at the Premises and that you shall have sole responsibility for ensuring that all other users understand and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable Softcom policies including, but not limited to, acceptable use policies. You further acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible for any transactions, including, without limitation, purchases made through or in connection with the Service. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Softcom and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents against all claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of the use of the Service, the Softcom Equipment and/or the Customer Equipment or the breach of this Agreement or any of the applicable Softcom policies by you or any other user of the Service at the Premises. The Softcom Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is posted at www.softcom.net. You further agree that Softcom may modify the AUP or other policies from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE TERMS OF THE AUP AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SOFTCOM POLICIES MAY BE PUT INTO EFFECT OR REVISED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE BY POSTING A NEW VERSION OF THE AUP OR POLICY AS SET FORTH ABOVE. YOU AND OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE SHOULD CONSULT THE AUP AND ALL POSTED POLICIES REGULARLY TO CONFORM TO THE MOST RECENT VERSION.

h) Failure to Pay. Failure to pay your monthly service charges is not an accepted way to terminate your service with Softcom. YOU MUST NOTIFY SOFTCOM CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELY IF YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. Accounts which are on temporary hold due to non payment continue to accrue service charges until such time as Softcom’s property that was placed on your premises is returned to Softcom in good working condition.
i) Money Back Guarantee. New customers who have not had an account with Softcom in the past eighteen (18) months may request, within the first thirty (30) calendar days from the time your service is installed, a cancellation of your service.

11) LIMITATION OF SOFTCOM’S LIABILITY
a) Application. The limitations of liability set forth in this Section apply to any acts, omissions, and negligence of Softcom and its underlying third-party service providers, agents, suppliers, distributors, licensors and business partners (and their respective officers, employees, agents, contractors or representatives) which, but for that provision, would give rise to a cause of action in contract, tort or under any other legal doctrine. YOU MUST COMMENCE YOUR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED ON SUCH EVENTS, OR FACTS.

THIS SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY RELATING TO SUCH ACTIVITY. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICES MAY NEED TO BE OPENED, UPDATED, ACCESSED OR USED EITHER BY YOU OR BY US OR OUR AGENTS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE INSTALLATION, UPDATING OR REPAIR OF THE SERVICE. THE OPENING, ACCESSING OR USE OF YOUR COMPUTER, OTHER DEVICES USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE MAY VOID WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY THE COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR OTHER PARTIES RELATING TO THE COMPUTER’S OR DEVICE’S HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE. NEITHER SOFTCOM NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR AGENTS, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER AS THE RESULT OF THE VOIDING OF ANY SUCH WARRANTIES.

d) Software. When you use certain features of the Service, such as online features (where available), you may require special software or applications. Softcom makes no representation or warranty that any software or application downloaded or installed on Customer Equipment does not contain a virus or other harmful feature. It is your sole responsibility to take appropriate precautions to protect any Customer Equipment from damage to its software, files, and data as a result of any such virus or other harmful feature. We may, but are not required to, terminate all or any portion of the installation or operation of the Service if a virus or other harmful feature or software is found to be present on your Customer Equipment. We are not required to provide you with any assistance in removal of viruses. If we decide, in our sole discretion, to install or run virus check software on your Customer Equipment, we make no representation or warranty that the virus check software will detect or correct any or all viruses.

NEITHER SOFTCOM NOR ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSORS OR BUSINESS PARTNERS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF ANY SOFTWARE, FILES, OR DATA.
e) Service Availability and Quality. Softcom makes no warranty regarding system and/or network availability and/or system access speed. Although Softcom strives to maintain 100% network availability for customers, there are many factors and variables which are out of Softcom’s direct control. Softcom may run maintenance on its systems from 12:01am until 5:00am pacific time which may affect system availability.
System availability and response speed can and will vary, and no warranty or guarantee for either is made and/or claimed. All speed and throughput claims are stated as “up to” maximum(s) under ideal conditions, and do vary. Actual data transfer rates are measured at the network interface from the Softcom customer premises equipment to the edge of Softcom’s network. Softcom is not responsible for performance and/or availability of networks outside the edge of Softcom’s network. Softcom is not responsible for performance and/or availability of networks at or behind any Customer Equipment. Stated service speeds are subject to 10%-20% protocol overhead. Actual transfer rates above 80% of the listed minimum transfer rate will be considered within acceptable boundaries.
f) Disruption of Service. The Service is not fail-safe and is not designed or intended for use in situations requiring fail-safe performance or in which an error or interruption in the Service could lead to injury to business, persons, property, or environment (“High Risk Activities”). These High Risk Activities may include, without limitation, vital business, or personal communications, or activities where absolutely accurate data or information is required. You expressly assume the risks of any damages resulting from High Risk Activities.
