PRIVACY POLICY
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. If you're just surfing around, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the page(s) you visited.
If you buy tickets or memberships through our site, we do retain your name, address, phone and email address for our records.
We will not sell your personally identifiable information to anyone.
SECURITY POLICY
Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
We do not store your credit card information on our servers.
The rules concerning storage of credit card information are strict and hard to comply with for a bunch of simple theatre folks like ourselves, so for that reason, we do not store that information.
Your card info is transmitted to the payment processor and then promptly discarded once the transaction is completed.
REFUND POLICY
All sales are final.
Subscribers enjoy ticket exchanges as spelled out in our box office policies.
SHIPPING POLICY
All single-show tickets purchased through the website will be held at the box office for pick-up.
All season long membership subscriptions will be sent by US Mail.
