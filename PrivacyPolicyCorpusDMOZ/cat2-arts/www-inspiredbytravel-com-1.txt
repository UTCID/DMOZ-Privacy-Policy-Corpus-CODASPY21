A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive or other data storage device. Once you agree, the file is added. Cookies allow websites to respond to you as an individual. The website can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
We use two cookies which are essential to the running of this site. One stores the viewer's choice regarding the setting of cookies (this lasts for 1 year unless deleted by the user via their browser settings), and the other is a session cookie which allows use of the functionality of site for the duration of that browser session, at the end of which it is deleted. Neither cookie allows any tracking or analytics.
If you continue to use the site, these cookies will be set.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies using the slide-up panel at the bottom of our website. You can change your preferences at any time by clicking on the Cookies link in the footer which will redisplay the slide-up panel.
