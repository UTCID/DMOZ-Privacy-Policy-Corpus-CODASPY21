Gary’s privacy Policy
When it comes to privacy I can totally relate.  My cousins, which are now my daughter’s role models are constantly putting pictures up online of her.  I have to tell them again and again that we do not want Chloe up on Facebook or any other social media site.
Hence my personal frustration with this topic of privacy you can bet your butt that we won’t be collecting any cookies, ip addresses or internet traffic.
If you need to reach me about my privacy policy contact me here.
