Security
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put appropriate technical and organisations measures in place to safeguard your information. The council assures this by complying with relevant security best practice standards.
If a data breach does occur, we will do everything in our power to limit the damage and comply with the Information Commissioner’s guidance. In the case of a high-risk data breach, and depending on the circumstances, we will inform you about the remedial actions to prevent any further damage. We will also inform the Information Commissioner’s Office of qualifying data breaches.
Unfortunately, no security measures are completely breach proof. We therefore cannot fully guarantee that your personal data will not be compromised, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorised acts of others.
The procedures and related standards include limiting access to data on a need to know basis and regularly testing and auditing our security practices and technologies.
Employees and temporary workers are required to follow policies and procedures and complete mandatory annual training to understand data protection and information security.
Your rights
Brent Council shall process your information in adherence to your individual rights under the data protection legislation.
The right to be informed
This is your right know about how your data is being processed, who it is given to, for what purpose and anything else that guarantees your rights, this is sometimes referred to as a privacy notice or a fair processing notice. This web page provides a summary and both the Record of Processing Activities and the links to the service specific privacy notices gives further details. When you provide information the Council will ensure that you have access to a privacy notice.
The right of access
You have a right to access your personal data and relevant supplementary information. This is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR). Further information can be found at www.ico.org.uk.
You can log in to My Account and submit a SAR request, which allows you to monitor the progress of your request online.
Alternatively you can download and complete a Subject Access Request form. Email your completed form to the Data Protection Officer at dpo@brent.gov.uk, or post it to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ. You should receive a response within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests as described under the ICO’s SAR code of practice. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated within the month deadline.
In most cases we cannot charge you a fee to comply with a subject access request. However, where the request is considered manifestly unfounded or excessive we may charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request. We may also charge a reasonable fee if you request further copies of your data following a request. We would base this fee on the administrative costs of providing further copies.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. As we are a large organisation with multiple departments and systems, we may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to help locate the information you have asked for.
The right to rectification
If you believe that any personal data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. We may require evidence from you. In most cases we will delete information, correct information or add additional notes indicating corrections. You can do this by contacting the service area that you are concerned about directly. Otherwise you can make a request by emailing the Data Protection Officer at dpo@brent.gov.uk, or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ
The right to erasure
This is also known as “the right to be forgotten”. Please note that there are circumstances when your information cannot be erased. This includes situations whereby the council is required to retain information for statutory purposes in accordance with its data retention policy.  You can make a request by emailing the Data Protection Officer at dpo@brent.gov.uk, or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ . You should receive a response with 30 days.
The right to restrict processing
You have a right to request the council to ‘block’ or suppress processing of your personal data. Please note that this may not apply for most of the council’s processes because there is usually a legal duty to process information.
The right to data portability
You have the right to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes. You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The Council will assist in the transmission of such data to another entity, upon request, to the extent technically feasible. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use, or where we need the information to perform a contract for you. You can make a request by emailing the Data Protection Officer at dpo@brent.gov.uk, or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ.

The right to withdraw consent
If you have consented to the processing of your personal data via a consent form or process, you have the right to revoke such consent through a consent withdrawal process. This will be specific to the process you have consented to. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
Rights related to automated decision making including profiling
There are restrictions on automated decisions based solely on automated means without any human involvement. Also there are restrictions on profiling. You can make a an enquiry by emailing the Data Protection Officer at dpo@brent.gov.uk, or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ
Public Funds
Brent Council is required by law to protect the public funds it administers. We may use any of the information you provide to us for the prevention and detection of crime. We may also share this information with other bodies that are responsible for auditing or administering public funds including the Public Sector Audit Appointments Ltd, National Audit Office, Financial Reporting Council, Cabinet Office, Department for Work and Pensions, and other local authorities, HM Revenue and Customs, and the Police.
In addition to undertaking our own data matching to identify errors and potential frauds we are required to take part in national data matching exercises undertaken by the National Fraud Initiative. The use of data by the National Fraud Initiative in a data matching exercise is carried out under its powers in Part 2A of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It does not require the consent of the individuals concerned.
Concerns about data protection
If you have a concern about the way we are collecting or using your personal data, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before making a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office by visiting https://ico.org.uk/concerns/. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner.
