You can visit our site anonymously. We do not request any personal data from you if you want to visit our website.
If you send an e-mail to one of our addresses (xxx@ashra.com), your e-mail address will be kept confidential. We do not sell or disclose e-mail addresses.
We do not use cookies or other means to track our visitors' behaviour on our website. We can do without any advertising networks or analytics scripts! However, it's beyond our control what other websites do. This is especially valid for video or similar services we include into our website.
Our webserver writes all requests into a logfile. If we encounter problems with our site, we check this logfile (e.g. for invalid links). But that's all. We do not try to find out who you are or where you come from.
Any important changes of this Privacy Statement will be published on the main page www.ashra.com. However, no such changes are planned.
Other websites which we link to may have other privacy policies. Of course, we are not responsible for them.
