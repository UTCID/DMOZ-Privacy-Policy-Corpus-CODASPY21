Bill’s Rules of the Universe
“Sometimes a plate of spaghetti is the best thing in the world.”“Everything takes longer than you think.”“It’s always harder to put something back together than it is to take it apart.”“If you spend all your time cleaning your desk, all you’ll have is a clean desk. That’s not enough.”“Listen—you’re missing something cool.”“All children should be given a ukulele when they’re born.”“We’re more alike than we are different.”“If you are older than two and can’t sing a song and tell a story, you’re in trouble.”
