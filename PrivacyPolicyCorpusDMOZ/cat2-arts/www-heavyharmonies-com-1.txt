September 12, 2020:
Two Weeks Into the Annual Heavy Harmonies Donation Drive!
We're two weeks into the annual donation drive, a month left to go, and donations stand at covering 33% of the site's annual out-of-pocket expenses. Most
of the regular donors have already contributed, so I'm asking that if
you find the site useful and enjoyable, please consider kicking in $10 or
$20 a year. It keeps the site free for everyone and no annoying off-topic ads or ad-blocker
nag messages.
Donation buttons are shown below. There is a thread on the HH forum that explains the perks for donating at the $20 and $50 levels.
Thank you for supporting the Heavy Harmonies community!
-Dan
Your ongoing support of Heavy Harmonies is appreciated!
