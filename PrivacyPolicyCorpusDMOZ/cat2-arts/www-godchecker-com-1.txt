We aim to be a responsible website and have concocted the following privacy statement which we hope will bring you enlightenment.

We do have a mailing list which we sometimes use to let people know about updates and new stuff. You can subscribe here. If you write to us, you can additionally opt-in to the mailing list at the same time. We absolutely will not bombard your inbox every time we blow our noses. We use Mailchimp to handle our mailing list, one of the net’s most respected email providers, so you can rest assured, etc etc. You can opt out at any time and we’ll forget you ever existed.
