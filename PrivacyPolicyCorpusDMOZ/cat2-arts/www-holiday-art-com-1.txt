HOLIDAY ART PRIVACY POLICY
Hello, my name is Robert Winton.
HolidayArt.com is my personal web site.
What information do I collect?
Pretty much the same as if you walked into a store at the mall.
So enjoy looking around, I'm not looking into your wallet while you browse.
I will not know your name, email address, phone number, address, etc, unless you tell me.
No, I don't store 'cookies' on your machine.
You could set your browser's security and privacy settings on maximum and have absolutely no problems using this site.
How do I use the information?
I will not rent, trade, or sell your email name.
Same thing with your other information such as your name, phone number, and address.
If you decided to give me your contact information, I would use it to send you what you ask me to send you.
Duration.
I hope you are happy with this policy and it shouldn't need to be changed.
But I do reserve the right to change this policy at any time without advanced notice.
This policy was last changed during the summer of 2003.
Questions about this policy?
You can ask me on this site's contact page.
And, yes, it works so you can send your question or comment without including your name or phone number!
