Title IX
Sexual Misconduct Response and Prevention at Pepperdine University
Pepperdine University affirms that all members of our community are created in the
image of God and therefore should be treated with dignity and respect. Our University
code of ethics states that we do not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of any status
or condition protected by applicable federal or state law. Further, we respect the
inherent worth of each member of the community and do not engage in any forms of harassment.
We follow the profound truth found in the Golden Rule, "In everything do to others
as you would have them do to you" (Matthew 7:12).
