Gathering and Use of Information

We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis. WQED and our Affiliated Web Sites will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information that has been supplied to us through this website to any third party without first receiving the user's permission.

Privacy Policy for WQED KIDS Sites
WQED has long been recognized as a source of non-commercial, high quality children's programming. The adults who care for children trust WQED and our partners to provide a safe, stimulating and entertaining haven of educational programming, projects and services. We encourage parents, and other caregivers to spend time online with their children, to supervise their child's online activities and to enjoy the interactive activities offered on the WQED sites together.
WQED and our Affiliated Web Sites support the goals and guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Better Business Bureau, as well as the efforts of the Center for Media Education (CME) and other organizations' concerned with children's online safety and privacy. In order to further our corporate mission of providing a safe, non-commercial environment for children in all media, and to better serve our online audience, we have designed these special guidelines for WQED KIDS sites and any other WQED sites that offer kids opportunities to contribute and participate.
1. WQED KIDS content is screened carefully to ensure quality, educational applications. The WQED editorial staff works closely with our producers to guarantee that our sites supply high quality, educational content that goes far beyond the promotion of the companion broadcast program. WQED KIDS regularly monitors our sites to make sure the content meets our standards. We encourage you to contact us with any suggestions or comments about our content.
2. WQED KIDS Web sites may contain "links" to other sites, and we select these sites carefully to make sure that, when they are selected, they meet our high standards of decency and integrity. Although we have taken all precautions to ensure that these links meet our standards when they were selected, we cannot guarantee that the sites have not changed since the time they were selected and that they continue to meet our standards. For this and other reasons, all WQED KIDS links to outside sites contain a "bridge page" to alert users that they are leaving the WQED KIDS Web site.
3. WQED KIDS protects the identity of our visitors by limiting the collection of personal information, with certain clearly noted exceptions. No child's personally identifiable information is ever posted online or shared with third parties unless a parent or guardian has provided written authorization by use of a verified e-mail address, fax or ordinary mail (called "snail mail"). Personal information may be collected and used by WQED and our Affiliate Sites in order to provide our visitors with additional ways of obtaining information (such as e-mail responses from producers or program-related newsletters). Whenever a visitor provides identifiable information, it is always explained how the information will be used; if the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to "opt out"."Opting-out" may mean exclusion from certain activities for which the identifiable information is needed. (For example, if a contest participant elects to "opt-out" on permitting us to collect and use their personal information, we cannot contact them if they win without obtaining such information.)
4. Information promoting the sale or availability of program-related or non-program-related goods and services may not be included on WQED KIDS Web Sites on WQED. Exceptions to this rule may be made by WQED in special cases for designed instructional material offered at no or nominal cost.

Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of WQED following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.
