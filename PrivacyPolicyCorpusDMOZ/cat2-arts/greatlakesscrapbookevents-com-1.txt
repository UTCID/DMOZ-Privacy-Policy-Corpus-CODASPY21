Privacy Policy:  Our Pledge to You, Our Customer
Scrapbooks Mega Meet, LLC dba Great Lakes Scrapbook Events (GLSE) respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent, loan or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties, with the exception of basic mailing information which is made available to duly registered exhibitors and sponsors at our event if requested. Any information you give us about yourself is held with the utmost care and security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.
Information collected on our Web site is collected and used by Great Lakes Scrapbook Events and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Great Lakes Mega Meet”, “Birch Run Scrapbooking & Stamping Show”, “Arctic Blast Crop”, and other events produced by GLSE) and, in limited cases, GLSE service providers who are subject to confidentiality agreements. Basic mailing information is made available to duly registered exhibitors at our event if requested.  GLSE  will not collect any personal information about customers except when specifically and knowingly provided by them.
Use of Information
Information collected by GLSE is used by us for two main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how to improve our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular. Second,  we collect information to enable customers  to conduct transactions on our Web site.  If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform you when we collect the information.
From time to time, we may use a limited number of service providers to assist us with customer service, such as answering telephone calls and e-mails. These service providers only use customer information to assist our customers. They must keep all customer information strictly confidential and return it to GLSE when our agreements with them end. Thus, the information collected by these service providers is controlled by GLSE and will only be used for the purposes described in this policy.
On occasion, GLSE may also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our Web site). However, GLSE does not share any personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third parties, with the exception of duly registered event exhibitors who have requested mailing information.
Security
At Great Lakes Scrapbook Events, part of our job is to make sure your registration experience is safe and secure. That means your credit card is safe, your personal information is safe, and your password is safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and stringent limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to the data.  We do not retain your credit card information on our servers once your transaction has been processed.
