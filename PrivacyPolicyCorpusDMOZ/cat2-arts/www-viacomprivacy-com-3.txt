CA Do Not Sell My Info
ACCESS AND DELETION REQUEST
WELCOME TO THE VIACOM DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS CENTER!
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to request access to or deletion of their personal information, to request additional details about our information practices, to opt out of the "sale" of their personal information, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. Below we explain how you may exercise these rights.
Access and Deletion Request Instructions
To submit a Data Access or Deletion Request, please click Data Requests Submission and it will take you directly to the Data Request Submission page in order for you to submit your Request.
Do Not Sell My Information Instructions
At Viacom, we will never sell any information that identifies you personally like your name, email address, or phone number. We do work with advertising partners who use cookies and device identifiers as described in our Privacy Policy to show ads that are targeted to your interests. Some of these disclosures may be considered sales under California law. You may opt out of these disclosures by following the instructions below. Please note that if you use a different browser or device to access a Viacom website or mobile or online application, or if you visit a different Viacom property, you will need to renew this choice and will need to opt out separately on each website and device.
Websites:
To opt out of the disclosure of your personal information associated with your browser or device from a Viacom website, you may do so by using the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") CCPA Tool. The DAA offers an Ad Choices tool, adapted specifically for the "Do Not Sell My Personal Info" right under the California Consumer Privacy Act 2019, which offers a centralized place to opt out of the sale of personal information by any or all DAA participating businesses that are collecting your personal information across multiple websites. To exercise your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information for use in interest-based advertising by these third parties, click on the icon below.
Please visit http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html for more information on the key third-party partners that we use to provide online behavioral advertising, sometimes called personalized advertising or tailored advertising and your choices regarding the use of your information for those purposes.
