Privacy Policy
Who likes to be spied on? Nobody except you exhibitionists out there. But one person's definition
differs from another, so let's set down exactly what That Cow will actually remember in its tiny
little bovine brain.
We collect email addresses from users for two reasons. First, for general user management, to verify
you exist, prevent abuse of the system, and allowing for password recovery. Secondly, to send news
updates to users who choose to receive them. As of this moment, such updates have yet to actually
be sent out. Those of you who signed up early on were not presented a choice to receive messages or
not, but you may select that now under your user options. Your email address will never be shared.
Also, we set cookies for session management - keeping track of when you're logged in - because of
persistent annoyances with http authentication (some of you may remember a box that popped up
when you logged in before), this seems the best choice. If you block cookies, you may experience
problems logging in - blocking third party cookies may be a good choice for you. Ads do appear on
That Cow from external sites which may set their own cookies.
Material you submit (reviews, articles, comments, and the like) to That Cow will be tied to your
user account. Anonymous reviews are currently allowed, though they may be reevaluated in the
future. In either case, by submitting such materials, you are granting That Cow permission to
publish your work. Of course, copyright remains yours.
This policy may be revised, as That Cow wasn't even allowed to take the LSAT. Ooh, you're a dirty
farm animal and will just be a distraction to the other prospective law students. Wankers.
