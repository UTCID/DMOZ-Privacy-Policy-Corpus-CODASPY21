"Legally Blonde" is a career misstep for a talented actress capable of creating much more complex characters.

Mrs. Witherspoon is cast well below her considerable talents as an airhead Bel Air brat who has it all.

August 4, 2001
A featherweight romp that wants to flaunt stereotypes but instead winds up reaffirming them.

David Noh
Film Journal International
July 30, 2001
Soon degenerates into a too-slick silliness that confuses empowerment with cloying cutesiness.

Had the responsibility, the obligation, to be clever enough to deserve Reese Witherspoon, and it fails.

Globe and Mail
July 16, 2001
They've devised a potentially rich premise, only to play it safe, smoothing off every sharp edge and dumbing down any acerbic point.

Starts heading nowhere after the first half-hour, and careers and flounders badly until it gets there.
