If you purchased a Promote It campaign and terminate the campaign early (other than for a refund condition set forth above) during the active listing period, you are not entitled to a refund under our Refund Policy. However, on a case by case basis, and solely at our discretion for such reasons as we deem appropriate, a portion of the remaining unused balance for that campaign may be credited to your Promote It Campaign List as a good faith Promote It Credit. Promote It Credits might not be offered to all users. You have no right, interest, title, or claim in such credits, regardless of whether any other user has received such a credit. Promote It Credits are a form of Site credit redeemable only toward future Promote It campaign purchases. We may expire Promote It Credits at any time, but in all cases Promote It Credits will expire one year after the date of your last Promote It activity (purchasing a campaign, renewing a campaign, cancelling a campaign). We reserve the right to discontinue Promote It Credits at which point such Promote It Credits will be deemed immediately expired. Separately we may modify these terms at any time. To redeem, and maintain Promote It Credits, you must create and maintain a Site account in good standing, as required under the General Terms and Conditions. Unless required by law, Promote It Credits are non-transferable and are not redeemable for cash.

Advertisements may be placed on Facebook, Google, or other web sites. We do not promise that an Advertisement will run for a specific length of time. The length of an advertising campaign is a function of the Services Fee paid by you and where an Advertisement is placed.

Such metrics will include, the start date for an Advertisement; the percentage completion of the advertising campaign (e.g., the campaign is 50% completed or 75% completed), impressions, and click-throughs. Additional metrics may be included at our discretion.
(d) We will create a landing page/conversion page for you. This will be the page that a user comes to when they click through an Advertisement. This page may require that a user become your “fan” or take some other affirmative action in order to download a free song that you may provide when advertising a song.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT AN ADVERTISEMENT WILL BE PLACED ON ANY SPECIFIC PAGE OR WEB SITE OR ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHEN AN ADVERTISEMENT MAY APPEAR OR FOR HOW LONG AN ADVERTISEMENT MAY RUN OR BE USED.
WE DO NOT PROMISE THAT THE PROMOTE IT SERVICE WILL BE PROVIDED IN A TIMELY MANNER, WITHOUT ERRORS, OR THAT THE PROMOTE IT SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. WE DO NOT PROMISE OR GUARANTEE ANY RESULTS WHEN USING THE PROMOTE IT SERVICE.

In all such cases, we shall maintain the Fan Data securely and protect from any further processing. These EEA Data Processing Terms shall survive for so long as we continue to retain any Fan Data.
9. COOPERATION:
(a) We will provide commercially reasonable cooperation to assist you in your response to any requests from data protection authorities with authority relating to the processing of Fan Data. In the event that any such request is made directly to us, we shall not respond to such communication directly without your prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If we are required to respond to such a request, we shall promptly notify you and provide you with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.
(b) To the extent you do not have the ability to independently correct, amend, or delete Fan Data, or block or restrict processing of Fan Data, then at your written direction and to the extent required by GDPR, we shall comply with any commercially reasonable request by you to facilitate such actions. To the extent legally permitted, you will be responsible for any costs arising from our or our sub-processors’ provision of such assistance. We shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify you if we receive a request from an individual data subject for access to, correction, amendment or deletion of that person’s Fan Data, or a request to restrict processing. We shall provide you with commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance in relation to handling of a data subject’s request, to the extent legally permitted and to the extent you do not have the ability to address the request independently.

You shall not exercise this right more than once per year, including with respect to any support required to perform a data protection impact assessment.
(d) If a law enforcement agency sends us a demand for Fan Data (for example, through a subpoena or court order), we may attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from you. As part of this effort, we may provide your basic contact information to the law enforcement agency.
