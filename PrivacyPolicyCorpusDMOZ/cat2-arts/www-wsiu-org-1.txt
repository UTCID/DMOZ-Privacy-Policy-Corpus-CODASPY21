Privacy Policy
Your Privacy is Important to Us…
Out of respect for your privacy, WSIU will not share your personal information with any third party organization: we do not sell, rent, or trade the names of our donors. Your gift information is processed only by WSIU and SIU Foundation staff. This policy applies to all pledges, whether online, by phone, or by mail. Online pledges are processed through the SIU Foundation’s secure server to safeguard the integrity of your personal and financial data.
For our online visitors, we also strive to protect privacy. We do not sell, rent, or trade email addresses to any third party organization. Any identifiable personal information that you may choose to give us during your site visit (perhaps through one of WSIU’s online polls or surveys) is used only by WSIU staff to help us serve you better. Our questions, and your replies, help us to identify programming and web content preferences and to ascertain which topics are of greatest interest to our audiences. The current WSIU website does not place cookies on your machine. If this changes, we will revise this privacy statement accordingly. If we want to know more about you individually, we will ask you directly and openly through an interactive online poll or survey that is clearly identified as a WSIU questionnaire.
Please be aware that other websites may have very different policies and procedures. We are not responsible for online practices or policies at any site other than wsiu.org. When you exit our site by following a link to another website, you will need to examine that site’s policy statement to determine whether it meets your needs.
Thank you for your interest and support.
