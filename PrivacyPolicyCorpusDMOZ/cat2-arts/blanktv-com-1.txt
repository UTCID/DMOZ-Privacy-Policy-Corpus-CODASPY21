SUBMISSION OF MATERIALS
By submitting your video content to Blank Nation, you are representing to Blank Nation that you are the legal copyright holder, a registered agent of said copyright holder or an official licensee of the content and that you are permitted to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, distribute, monetize, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform this material, in a secure digital format on any of the Blank Nation media platforms, including, but not limited to: BlankTV.com, DankTV.com, KrankTV.com, HankTV.com, SkankTV.com, TranqTV.com, ChannelSkin.com, as well as standalone channels such as BlankTV’s YouTube channel, BlankTV’s Google Music channel, BlankTV’s Facebook channel, BlankTV’s Roku channel and any future platforms, such as mobile, satellite television or any non-yet-developed technology.
You further agree that you will not submit material that is protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Blank Nation all of the license rights granted herein.
In terms of monetization, Blank Nation is operating on the traditional FM Radio/MTV model: You supply the content. We aggregate the content, as well as our own audience, (600,000 viewers and counting!). We will show the content for free to viewers, while selling ad space around the content. That ad revenue is what keeps the whole operation afloat. By submitting content, you are waiving your claim to that ad revenue, as it’s the only revenue we have. (For any inquiries on that end, especially MFN status/Rev Share, please contact sunset@blanktv.com. YouTube doesn’t currently offer an easy way to do this, but may in the near future, as we understand it).
You do maintain all ownership rights to any material submitted to Blank Nation.
For our part, Blank Nation promises to do our best to get your content viewed by as many people as possible. We will make sure all content is credited to the copyright holder. We will add hotlinks to both band and record label websites, where possible. We will provide links to artist pages on iTunes, Interpunk and other online retailers, to promote merch and music sales for the artist, as well as any social media sites.
If you currently use any of the myriad Digital Rights Management companies, (InGrooves, The Orchard, Tunecore, etc.), please contact your representative and let them know you’re submitting content to BlankTV and that you would like them to whitelist the video. They may require the video URL, which will be sent to you on publication.
Please submit all physical media to:
Blank Nation
1838 SW Broadway Drive
Portland, Oregon 97201-2213
USA
Our preferred format is online digital. If that is not an option, please send the highest resolution file you have, on DVD. If mini-DV (NTSC) is the only format you have, send it along and we’ll make it happen. If you are overseas or just in a hurry, please send your high-res files to vids@blanktv.com through a free file-sharing service, like Dropbox.com or WeTransfer.com, etc.
As new media technology gets better, we find better video codecs to work with and alternate outlets for showing your videos that may have different specs than our current platform. Please direct any questions to our content management department, at vids@blanktv.com.
If at any point, and for any reason, you would like your content removed from the Blank Nation web properties, please notify us in writing by sending your request to our content management department, at: vids@blanktv.com. The material will be removed from the sites as quickly as possible, in most cases within twenty-four hours.
If you have any questions about any of this, please email us at: vids@blanktv.com.
