Minnesota Lawyers for the Arts (MnLA)
Legal Assistance for Artists and Arts Organizations
Artists face a unique array of legal questions and challenges. Minnesota Lawyers for the Arts is here to help, by providing educational resources and connecting artists with attorneys who specialize in arts and entertainment law.
MnLA is the Minnesota chapter of the National Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts (VLA) Network. For chapters outside Minnesota, see this list compiled by Volunteer Lawyers and Accountants for the Arts in St. Louis, Missouri.
If you're looking for a brief in-person consultation with an attorney regarding business-related matters, copyright or trademark, see a list of upcoming events from our partners at LegalCORPS. You can also contact LegalCORPS at (612) 752-6687.
If you're looking for an attorney in Minnesota for a legal issue that falls outside the scope of services provided by Minnesota Lawyers for the Arts, see this guide.
