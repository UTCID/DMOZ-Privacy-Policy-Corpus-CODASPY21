PRICING:
All prices are as listed.
All prices are subject to change without notice.
All prices listed are in U.S. dollars (USD).
Kansas state residents are automatically charged 9.475% sales tax at checkout.
Canada and International customers, you are solely responsible for any customs charges, duties, VAT, or other taxes charged by your country.
All needlework designs include charts and instructions only, unless noted in the product description - all supplies (including fabric, threads, and finishing materials) will need to be purchased separately.
PAYMENT METHODS:
Payment methods include PayPal, Amazon Pay, and all major credit/debit cards. Please contact me before making a purchase, should you like to place an order with a credit card over the phone, mail me a check, or if you need to discuss an alternate payment option.
SHIPPING:
Shipping charges depend on the weight of your order, your shipping method, and your location. After entering your address information during the checkout procedure, you will see shipping options and pricing. I use USPS (United States Postal Service) and UPS (United Parcel Service). Contact me before ordering, should you prefer/require other shipment methods.
Electronic tracking information is provided for all envelopes and packages shipped to addresses located in the United States. International customers may need to select USPS Priority Mail to receive tracking information (and in some overseas areas, tracking information is not available).
I ship promptly. Items will generally ship in 1-2 business days with the exception of weekends and holidays.
Please use care when entering your shipping/payment information - I will not be held responsible if you enter your information incorrectly.
Once your package has left the building, I am unable to control the speed of delivery. Many times packages will arrive in Europe and other overseas destinations within a week to ten days; however, packages can also take quite a bit longer (3 weeks or more).
RETURNS POLICY:
At Blue Ribbon Designs, we strive to exceed all of your expectations. Should there happen to be a problem with your order, please contact me within 3 days of receipt and we will work together to rectify the situation.
Requesting a cancellation: a cancellation request must be recieved before the item/package has shipped - we cannot retrieve a package once it has been picked up by the post.
Due to copyright restriction, printed materials, charts, and patterns cannot be returned.
Electronic charts/patterns (PDFs, eGoods) are non-refundable.
