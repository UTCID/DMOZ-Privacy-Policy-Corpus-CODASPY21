As with Springboard's primary coronavirus page, this is an evolving list of resources for information, exchange, and support in this time. Accuracy at any given point cannot be guaranteed as this is a fast-moving and evolving situation. If you have updates or resources to add, please send them to legal@springboardforthearts.org.
Please consult a lawyer, accountant or other professional before making any decisions! The information on this page is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional advice. To find a lawyer, please see our primary MnLA page.
