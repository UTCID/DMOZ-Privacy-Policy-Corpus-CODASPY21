Privacy & Cookies Policy
The general public will have access to certain pages contained on the Website that contain general information about the Authors Guild, Inc. and the services it provides. The Website will also contain 1) an Application Section and Renewal Section, where prospective members may apply for or renew membership by giving certain identifying personal information, as well as credit card information (EU Residents, please see below), 2) an Events Calendar, where events of Authors Guild members in good standing (“Members”) may be posted, 3) a Member Directory where Members may enter information about themselves and their books. The Authors Guild may expand the Website, including the Events Calendar, the Member Directory, and other portions, to encompass any additional services it deems fit at its own discretion. Both Members and Pending Members may be permitted to upload or otherwise provide certain materials and other data to the Website, including the Event Calendar, and Member Directory. While some of those uploaded or provided materials may be shared with the general public, such as information on the Event Calendar and the Member Directory, much of the information provided will be viewable only by Members, Potential Members, and Authors Guild Staff.
Security Statement
The Authors Guild, Inc. (“Authors Guild”) intends to make accessible to the general public its website www.authorsguild.org (the “Website”). The Website takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect our Users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Website, including credit card information, the users’ information will be protected both online and off-line.
When our membership application page or membership renewal page asks current Members or Members who have applied for membership but are still waiting for approval (“Pending Members”) for their credit card information, the information provided by the Member or Pending Member will be encrypted and protected using industry-standard encryption technologies for transferring and receiving such data. While on a secure page, including but not limited to, our membership application page, membership renewal page, and login pages, the lock icon on internet browsers, such as the lock icons on Firefox and Google Chrome , become locked. While we use encryption protection to protect sensitive information online, we also take commercially reasonable efforts to protect this information off-line. All of the information provided by Members and Pending Members, not just sensitive credit card information referred to above, has restricted access within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment with limited access.
PRIVACY POLICY
The Authors Guild believes that privacy is important to the success and use of the Internet. This statement sets forth the Authors Guild’s Privacy Policy for www.authorsguild.org and describes what information is collected, how it is used and with whom it is shared.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE GATHER
In order to provide Members and Pending Members with quality services, the Authors Guild gathers the following types of information:
Information Members and Pending Members Give Us:
We collect the contact and other information you provide (such as name, physical address, billing address, email address, telephone number) when, for instance, you join the Authors Guild as a member, create an account to access the password protected Members and Pending Members Only Section (“the Website”) content, or purchase a new membership or renew an existing membership. We use this information to keep in contact with you and provide you with newsletters and other information about the Authors Guild, to provide you with marketing communications about our news, events, authors or books that we believe may interest you, or tell you about new website features or services. We may also use your information to provide services and support, including reviewing your contracts and answering your legal and other questions.
Automatically Collected Information:
The Authors Guild will also automatically gather information including:
1) the Internet domain from which you access the Website;
2) The IP address from which you access the Website;
3) The type of browser used to access the Website;
4) The operating system used to access the Website;
5) The date and time you access the Website;
6) The URLs of the pages you visit;
7) Your username to log into the Website; and
8) If you visited the Website from a third-party site, the URL of that third-party site.
This information is only used to help the Authors Guild make the website more useful to the general public as well as Members and Pending Members. The Website may also utilize “cookie” technology to collect information about how the Website is used.
With this data, the Authors Guild learns about the number of visitors to the Website, the information and materials that users are most interested in, and the types of technology Members and Pending Members use.
When and with Whom Do We Share Personal Information?
While some parts of the Website, including the Event Calendar and the Member Directory, will be publicly accessible, the Authors Guild does not willfully provide the personal information of Members and Pending Members to third parties unless it discloses its intention to do so prior to asking Members and Pending Members to provide such information. The Authors Guild reserves the right to disclose any personal information about you or your use of the Website without your prior consent if the Authors Guild has a good faith belief such action is consistent with our mission and is necessary to: 1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; 2) protect and defend the rights or property of the Authors Guild or its affiliated organizations 3) enforce the Privacy and Copyright Policy; or 4) to protect the interests of Members.
You have the right to request access to personal information that we hold about you to confirm its accuracy, to ask us to correct it, or to transfer your information to another service provider. If you are an EU resident and wish us to delete your personal information, please follow the procedure set out below.
Use of the Website by Minors
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act requires that we not knowingly collect or share personal information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian. If you are aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information without such consent, please contact us at the address below so that we can delete such information.
Withdrawal of Consent
If you are a resident of the EU, you may withdraw your consent to the Authors Guild’s retaining of your personal information at any time by emailing staff@authorsguild.org and requesting that specified personal information be removed from our records. If you request that all information be removed, such a withdrawal request will be deemed resignation from the Authors Guild, since we will not be able to continue to provide you with services without being able to contact you. If you ask for certain personal information to be deleted, that may limit the services that the Guild can provide you.
Changes to This Privacy Notice
From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements, or for other purposes. We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you at the last email address you provided us, by posting notice of such changes on our sites and applications, or by other means, consistent with applicable law.
