NINE NEW DEATHS. HERE TO TALK OF THE LATEST HEADLINES IS DR. STEVEN PRESCOTT WITH THE OKLAHOMA RESEARCH FOUNDATION. GOOD MORNING, GOOD TO SEE YOU. JASON: A LOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING WHEN IT COMES TO CORONAVIRUS. THE HOSPITALIZATIONS SURGING RIGHT NOW. 700 OKLAHOMANS HOSPITALIZED. MORE THAN HALF IN OKC AND TULSA. WHAT IS HAPPENING? >> I THINK IT IS AS WE FEARED WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WHEN WE TALKED. WE JUST DIDN’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GOING TO BE LIKE. WE ALL FEARED IT COULD COME BACK WORSE IN THE FALL. SO I DON’T THINK WE KNOW FOR SURE. THIS DISEASE IS GOING TO BE AROUND A WHILE. ALL WE CAN DO IS TO CONTROL IT AND DECREASE THE SPREAD. I KNOW IT IS REALLY BORING TO KEEP SAYING IT, BUT WE NEED -- EVERYBODY NEEDS TO WEAR YOUR MASKS, SOCIALLY DISTANCE YOURSELVES, WASH HER HANDS, GO THROUGH THOSE GOOD HEALTH PRACTICES SINCE MARCH. REINVIGORATE IN DOING THAT BECAUSE THAT’S GOOD -- THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO SLOW THIS DOWN. THERE’S NOTHING ELSE UNTIL WE GET THE VACCINE. >> WE TALK TO THE STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS AND HE SAYS HOSPITALS CAN HANDLE THE SPIKE. HE SAYS WE DO HAVE ROOM AND CAPACITY. THE QUESTION IS FOR HOW MUCH LONGER, OR WE APPROACHING A BREAKING POINT? >> I’M OBVIOUSLY THRILLED THAT OUR STATE HAS GOTTEN IN A POSITION TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT AND THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS. IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. WE CAN BE WORKING AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY ALL OF THE TIME INDEFINITELY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME BREAK. WE DON’T KNOW WHAT’S AROUND THE CORNER HERE. WE ARE COMING UP TO THE INFLUENZA SEASON. IT’S A DIFFERENT DISEASE, BUT HAS MANY SIMILARITIES. SO SUDDENLY WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE ON TOP OF COVID-19. NOW WE’RE GOING TO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS IN OUR HOSPITALS. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THE COURSE HERE SO WE DON’ PERSIST IN HAVING HOSPITALS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED. >> YOU MENTIONED VACCINES. I WANT TO ASK YOU, HE ALSO SAID OKLAHOMA COULD BE THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO GET THE VACCINE. HE SAYS THEY ARE FINALIZING THE PLANS. HOW WILL THAT ROLLOUT POSSIBLY LOOK IN OKLAHOMA? >> I HAD NOT HEARD THAT NEWS. FASCINATING IF TRUE. FIRST OFF, I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS -- AS I UNDERSTAND IT. I’VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HIRE A VERY LARGE COMPANIES TO DISTRIBUTE NATIONWIDE. THEY AND THE CDC WILL GIVE TO THE STATES AND EACH STATE WILL HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON HOW IT ORGANIZES. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS FOR ME. I WOULD SAY THE TOP PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO IMMUNIZE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. HE SAID WANT TO FIRST IMMUNIZE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO ARE AT GREATER RISK. THAT SOUNDS LOGICAL AND A CERTAIN SENSE, BUT WHAT IF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS GET SICK? THEY HAVE TO BE WELL TO TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE. FIRST SHOULD BE YOUR NURSES, PHYSICIANS, TECHNICIANS, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND THEN PEOPLE WHO ARE AT GREATER RISK OF HEART DISEASE, CANCER, LUNG DISEASE AND SO FORTH. NOW, HOW DO YOU GET THE VACCINE FROM THOSE CATEGORY SLOTS TO IN THE ARMS OF THE PEOPLE? THEY’VE GOT ELABORATE PLANS THEY ARE WORKING ON ROLLING OUT AND VERY -- VARIOUS FACILITIES. IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR AN EARLY VACCINE. JASON: I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THIS, THE PRESIDENT TOUTED REGENERON, THAT COCKTAIL HE SAID WAS BASICALLY A CURE FOR HIM. THE COMPANY HAS APPLIED TO THE FDA FOR EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR EXPERIMENTAL USE. IS THERE ANY PROMISE HERE FOR THAT? >> ABSOLUTELY. AT THE FOUNDATION, ABOUT 10 OR 12 YEARS AGO, WE INVENTED A PROCESS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT REGENERON HAS DONE HERE. IT IS A VERY SIMILAR INVENTION TO OURS TO MAKE THOSE ANTIBODIES. WE HAD MADE ANTIBODY FOR OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES USING THE TECHNOLOGY. SO YES, IT HAS TREMENDOUS PROMISE. THIS IS A TYPE OF TREATMENT USED FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS THE HIGH-TECH VERSION OF THAT PLASMA THAT PEOPLE RECOVERED FROM THE DISEASE, THE CONVALESCENT PLASMA. THIS IS A HIGH-TECH LABORATORY VERSION. I’M VERY OPTIMISTIC THIS WILL BE A TREATMENT. DOES IT NEED SOME MORE WORK? HARD TO SAY. I WOULD BE QUITE OPTIMISTIC. JASON: AT LEAST SOME HOPE THERE ON THE HORIZON.

weeks? Have you been in close contact with someone testing
positive for COVID-19? Do you have a fever greater than 100 degrees? Do you have respiratory issues?A fever alone is not an indication you need to be tested for COVID-19. But if you have traveled recently or come in contact with a COVID-19-positive person, you need to be tested.DO NOT GO TO A CLINIC OR EMERGENCY ROOM. Call your medical provider first and get instructions on how to report for a test.HOW DO YOU PREPARE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILYThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides these tips to help you and your family avoid contracting COVID-19:Take everyday preventive actions to stay healthy.Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Prepare your familyPrepare your homePlan Ahead ChecklistStay informedProtect your healthPrevent Getting SickPreventing spreadProtect Others from Getting SickWhat to do if you are sickCaring for yourself at homeCaring for Someone Who is SickFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides these answers to common questions from the public:What are the symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smellCan somebody spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Is it possible to get COVID-19 from touching objects?It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Is it safe to go on a cruise?Cruises put large numbers of people, often from countries around the world, in frequent and close contact with each other. This can promote the spread of respiratory viruses, such as the virus that causes COVID-19. You may get sick from close contact with an infected person or by touching contaminated surfaces. CDC recommends that travelers, particularly those with underlying health issues, defer all cruise ship travel.What is the risk of getting COVID-19 on an airplane?Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on airplanes. Although the risk of infection on an airplane is low, travelers should try to avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol.HELPFUL RESOURCES:Centers for Disease Control and PreventionOklahoma State Department of Health COVID-19 responseOklahoma City-County Health DepartmentCleveland County Health DepartmentCanadian County Health DepartmentLogan County Health DepartmentTulsa Health DepartmentFull list of county health departments across OklahomaHow to clean your phone
