Privacy Notice
This page sets out the details of the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales’ (BBC NOW) privacy notice in relation to information collected about you. We process that information under data protection law, which is found mainly in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
Who we are
BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of WalesBBC Hoddinott HallCardiff BayCF10 5AL
The Orchestra is part of the British Broadcasting Corporation (the BBC), the largest broadcasting organisation in the world. We are a public service broadcaster, established by a Royal Charter and primarily funded by the licence fee that is paid by households in the UK, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The BBC includes the BBC World Service, which broadcasts to the world on radio, on TV and online, providing news and information in over 40 languages.
The licence fee is supplemented by income from the commercial exploitation of licence fee funded content and infrastructure through commercial subsidiaries – BBC Studios Ltd, BBC Global News Ltd and BBC Studioworks.
The BBC as data controller
The BBC is responsible for the personal data you supply to the Orchestra. In data protection law, this is called being the data controller. This means we decide how to collect and use your data and are responsible for ensuring that your data is kept safely and used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. Your data is processed for the purposes of the Orchestra’s legitimate interests in operating its business and, in particular, to sell you tickets to events, and for marketing in planning future activity.
If you have questions about how we handle your data you can contact BBC NOW as follows:
Head of Marketing and CommunicationsBBC National Orchestra & Chorus of WalesBBC Hoddinott HallCardiff BayCF10 5AL
Email: now@bbc.co.uk
You can also contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you have concerns about how we use your personal data. The BBC’s ICO registration number is Z517352X.
How we collect information about you
You give us your information when you buy a concert ticket, sign up for one of our events, update your contact preferences, complete a survey or communicate with us. We also keep your details when you sign up to receive emails from us.
We sell tickets for our events both via our venues - St David’s Hall, Brangwyn Hall (sold via Grand Theatre Swansea), Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Wales Millennium Centre, Pontio (also for events in Prichard-Jones Hall, Bangor), Venue Cymru and Hafren – and via our telephone booking line the BBC National Orchestra of Wales Audience Line (“Audience Line”).
If you book a ticket via the Audience Line we will keep a record of that transaction’s data, which may include your name, delivery address, email address and telephone number. We do not retain credit or debit card information on site; all such information is encrypted and stored off-site in secure servers. We will also take information in order to determine eligibility for certain concessionary tickets that might be based on age, education status or entitlement to disability related concessions/access scheme tickets, including membership of Hynt (http://www.hynt.co.uk).
We may also invite you to answer various general questions about yourself including any areas in which you are interested so that information can be tailored to cover the areas in which we believe you might be interested for future reference.
We keep a record of the communications we send you, and we may track whether you respond to them so we can make sure we are sending you the most relevant information.
Other personal information we collect may include:
your name and title
postal address, email address and phone number
ticket purchase and event registration / attendance
payment information to process your ticket sale
contact preferences
details of correspondence sent to you, or received from you
When we ask you to provide your personal information we will let you know why we are asking, and how we will use your data, by directing you towards this notice.
What we do with your information
We may use your information to send you promotional and marketing information by post or by electronic means. These types of communications can include:
informing you of other products, services or events related to the Orchestra, such as concerts, events and broadcasts
our season brochures
news and updates about the Orchestra, What’s On guides, and newsletters
surveys for market research purposes
to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;
to provide aggregate information about our users to stakeholders (but not to advertisers)
We process your data for certain legitimate business purposes in order to provide you with the best experiences and most relevant information. These include recording your ticket purchases, subscriptions, keeping you up-to-date on the events you have booked as well as sending you information about similar BBC NOW events and opportunities.
You can opt out of any / all of our promotional and marketing communications at any point simply by contacting now@bbc.co.uk
We will normally hold your information for as long as you are actively attending concerts. If you choose to opt out, your details will be added to a suppression list. If you do not actively engage with us by booking a ticket or updating your contact preferences, we will suppress your account details after five years. We will continue to retain records on our system for up to 15 years from the last noted activity for analytical purposes, which form a legitimate interest for our business.We will not supply your details to third party organisations to allow them to contact you with marketing information unless you have given us specific permission to do so.
Who we share your information with
We use a system called Tessitura to store your information, process tickets bookings and manage your contact preferences; Tessitura is managed by Wales Millennium Centre (“the Centre”). In 2007 the Centre created a Consortium that makes it possible for other arts organisations to benefit from their ticketing system, Tessitura, at a lower level of investment than would otherwise be required from them. They offer a collegiate approach to the use of Tessitura with consortium partners, sharing a system for mutual benefit rather than a more traditional corporate relationship.
Transactions that take place directly via our venues are bound by the venues’ privacy policies as available via their websites; this includes transactions that are processed via Wales Millennium Centre directly via web, phone or in person. We may share anonymised information about customers with other organisations providing us with business services, particularly The Audience Agency and Arts Council Wales, who use this to analyse our audience and ticket sales to improve our services.
How we keep your information secure
We have implemented security procedures, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from:
unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification
When you provide data to us via the Audience Line the data that you provide will only be visible to BBC staff members who have undertaken data protection training from the BBC.
What rights do I have in relation to the information you have about me?
Data protection law gives you certain rights in relation to your data, including a right to ask us for access to your data, to correct or erase it, to restrict our processing of it, and to object to us processing it. For further details of these rights (some of which are not automatic and apply only in certain circumstances) see www.ico.org.uk
