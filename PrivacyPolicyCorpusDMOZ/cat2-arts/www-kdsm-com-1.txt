THIS SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH IT, ARE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE." WE, OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS CANNOT AND DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE MATERIALS, INFORMATION AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SERVICE, NOR DO WE GUARANTEE THAT THE MATERIALS, INFORMATION OR SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, OR CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITYUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE, OR OUR AFFILIATES, SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OUR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF USE OF THIS SERVICE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, EVEN IF WE ARE ADVISED BEFOREHAND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. (BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW.) YOU AGREE THAT OUR LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, ARISING OUT OF ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICE. LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED AND EXCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRECEDING SENTENCE EVEN IF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.DISPUTE RESOLUTION (the following to be considered an Arbitration Agreement between us and you)You agree to arbitrate – rather than litigate in court – any and all claims or disputes between the parties (including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of ours) that arise out of or in any way relate to this Service and products or services that we, our affiliates and/or our Service Providers (on our behalf) may provide to you in connection with your use of this Service; provided, however, that in no event shall this provision prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with any federal, state, or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against us on your behalf.
Arbitration will be binding and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury, and review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited. Instead, disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement. You agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with us. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court. Notwithstanding the above, you may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court’s jurisdiction, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear your claims.Class Action Waiver: You agree that all claims or disputes between us will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration. If you or we bring a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of the parties can bring a claim on a class or representative basis. Furthermore, neither you nor we may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or us from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general. We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this section will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and us. This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.Informal Dispute Resolution: You and the Sinclair Affiliate that operates the Service agree to try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration. If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify us of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to comments@sbgi.net so that we can attempt to resolve it with you. If we do not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration. Neither you nor we may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.Arbitration Procedures: You and the Sinclair Affiliate that operates the Service agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA’s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA’s rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control. To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to comments@sbgi.net. You must also comply with the AAA’s rules regarding initiation of arbitration. We will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this agreement or applicable law. We will not seek to recover our fees and costs from you in the arbitration unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous. If you are successful in the arbitration, we will pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than our last written settlement offer, we will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration. The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location. If you seek less than $10,000, then you may chose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions.USE OF COMMUNICATIONS SERVICESWe may provide a variety of services on this Service through which you can directly interact with others, such as email services, chat rooms, communications tools, forums, classifieds and other user-submitted advertising, and other public posting areas ("Communications Services"). For example, you may be able to upload content to participate in a contest or in news gathering on the Service, and you may be able to send a message to another user regarding content on our Service. We want to encourage an open exchange of information and ideas, but at the same time we want everyone to be able to enjoy these Communications Services.Without limiting the terms of our Privacy Policy, we will not, in the ordinary course of business, review private electronic messages that are not addressed to us or other content or materials submitted through this Service. However, we maintain the right to do so and to use any other forms of information available to us by virtue of your use of our Service (including, for example, reverse IP address inquiry) in order to comply with the law, to enforce this Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our Service, our customers, the public our employees, Service Providers and Affiliates.We reserve the right to deny access to any Communications Service to anyone who violates this visitor agreement or who, in our judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our Service or infringes the rights of others.

Otherwise you agree to pay our actual damages; to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.Viruses.
