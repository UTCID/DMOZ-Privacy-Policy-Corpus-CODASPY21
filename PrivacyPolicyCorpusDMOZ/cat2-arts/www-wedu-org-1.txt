Pledge/Order Cancellation Policy
To cancel an order or pledge you have placed with WEDU, please contact our Donor Services department via phone at 1-800-354-9338, option 2. Every effort will be made to accommodate the cancellation as long as no items or thank-you gifts have shipped. When contacting Donor Services to cancel an order or pledge, please be ready to provide your contact information and the date of your order or pledge. If you cancel your order or pledge AFTER item(s) have shipped, the Return Policy information listed below must be followed.
Fulfillment/Back Order Policy
WEDU does not have the resources to maintain a large inventory, so most items are ordered or created after you’ve placed your order or pledge. Item(s) generally ship within 4-6 weeks from the date of your order or pledge. Occasionally, our suppliers cannot keep up with the demand for a given item and our requests go on backorder. If the item(s) you requested are on backorder, we will notify you and you may either change and/or cancel your order or pledge.
Return Policy
You may return any part of your order for a replacement or refund within 30 days of receiving it. If the return is due to defective or damaged product or a shipping error, please contact Donor Services for a postage paid label. For questions regarding returning an item, please contact us using our online feedback form or call 1-800-354-9338, option 2. Please note that for cancellations, any item(s) must be received unopened at our address before a refund will be issued.
