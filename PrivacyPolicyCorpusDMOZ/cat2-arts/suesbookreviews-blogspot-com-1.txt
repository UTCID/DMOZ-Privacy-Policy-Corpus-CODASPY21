Privacy Policy
If you disagree with any of the privacy policy, please do not use this site.
I recognise that the privacy of your personal information is important. Below are details on the kind of personal information received when you visit, and how it is safeguarded.
All information collected on this website by suesbookreviews.blogspot.com and/or its affiliated companies will be used primarily for internal purposes and/or to enhance visitor enjoyment and experience. I may also use email addresses or other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who directly communicate with me, for example, to respond to visitors' questions. Any such contact by the author of suesbookreviews.blogspot.com is deemed by you to be at your request and with your permission, and shall be deemed by the parties, respectively, to be in compliance with all anti-spamming laws.
Suesbookreviews.blogspot.com does not share any personally identifiable information provided by visitors with third parties, unless you ask me to, and will never sell it to anyone. However, suesbookreviews.blogspot.com bears no responsibility for any action or policies of third parties who collect any information visitors may disclose on bulletin boards, chat areas, public forums, or other websites linked from within this website.
Third party advertisements are shown on suesbookreviews.blogspot.com, and general tracking programs are used to observe trends amongst visitors. Some of these may use technology such as cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a visitor's hard drive for record-keeping purposes, and a web beacon is a tiny transparent image on the page which allows the site to record the simple actions of visitors when opening the pages.
These cookies and web beacons will send information to the advertisers and other affiliates, including your IP address, your Internet service provider, the country where you reside , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether or not you have certain software (such as Flash or Javascript) installed. They are generally used for geo-targeting purposes (showing British ads to someone living in the UK, for instance) or showing certain adverts based on specific sites visited, such as showing author adverts to someone who frequents book review sites.
suesbookreviews.blogspot.com may also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements).
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ('interest based targeting').
The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting London, you may see London hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site of book reviews).
DART uses 'non personally identifiable information'.
It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.
You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with this site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
Google Analytics is used to help determine trends and interests of visitors. The Google Analytics site explains the type of data collected. Other site trackers are used, giving similar data; the sidebar of the blog shows which ones are currently being used. You can click the links to find out what kind of data they collect.
All advertisements are from affiliate services, and are contextual: based on the page contents, the location of the visitor, and the cookies already residing on the visitor's computer. Though suesbookreviews.blogspot.com is not responsible for their privacy terms, these links are to the privacy statements of the advertising affiliates, for your information:
* Amazon UK
* Amazon USA
* Google Adsense
suesbookreviews.blogspot.com reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time, so visitors are encouraged to review this policy from time to time.
It was last updated on 4th April 2009, based on the sample privacy policy provided by JenSense.
