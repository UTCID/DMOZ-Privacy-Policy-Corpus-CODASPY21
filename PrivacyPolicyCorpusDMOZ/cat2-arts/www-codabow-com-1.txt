Trial Terms and Conditions:
The bows are available for trial for a 7-day period that starts upon delivery of the bow. CodaBow will cover the costs of shipping and returning the bows and a $35 non-refundable trial fee will be charged. If the bow is not returned upon the completion of the trial, it is considered purchased, and the credit card will be charged the full amount of the bow. When returning the bow, use the original packaging and the return label included with the bow. Bow must be returned in like-new condition; customer is responsible for any damage or loss during the term of the trial.
Return Policy:
At CodaBow, we are committed to your complete satisfaction with your bow.  If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return your bow within 30 days for full refund (less any trial and shipping fees applied) or exchange.  All returns must be in their original condition with no signs of wear, damage, dings, or scrapes and include all original packaging. Returned items not adhering to this policy will be subject to a restocking/handling fee based on the amount of damage. The 30 day return policy begins the day the bow leaves the CodaBow facility. No returns or exchanges on Trade-Up purchases or custom products including but not limited to Standard CS Models, Marquise Custom, Custom Colored bows, or personal engravings on bows. Any custom bows will need 10-14 days between order and delivery.
Warranty:
We warrant the shaft of your CodaBow against defects in workmanship and material for the term of the warranty under normal playing conditions. (Warranty term for each model is specified in its FEATURES page and below.) CodaBow Warranty is available only to the original owner for a new CodaBow purchased from an Authorized CodaBow Dealer. A warranty will not be activated for a bow that was pre-owned or purchased through unauthorized channels. CodaBows must be registered within two years of the manufacture date to activate the warranty. (The first two digits of the serial number indicate the model year) . To receive a warranty repair or replacement, the owner of the bow must return it to the CodaBow Workshop in Winona, MN for evaluation. The warranty does not apply to routine care and maintenance such as rehairs; however, registering your CodaBow does avail the owner to several workshop benefits.
CodaBow Trade-Up Program:
Cannot be combined with any other offers or discounts. Discount and credits will be based off the bows warranty, age, condition, and MSRP at the time of purchase. CodaBow will not allow trials of bows purchased under the Trade-Up program. All sales are considered final and will be non-refundable with the exception of manufacturers warranty.
International Orders
Domestic and International Orders receive free shipping but may be subject to customs, duties, or import charges. The recipient of international shipments is responsible for any import taxes/customs duties and fees, which are charged once a shipment arrives in the receiving country. CodaBow cannot estimate these charges, and fees are the sole responsibility of the recipient. You may return your purchase within 30 days, per our regular returns policy. In the instance of a return, the buyer is responsible for the cost of return shipping.
