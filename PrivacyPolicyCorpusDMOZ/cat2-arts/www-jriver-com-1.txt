Online Privacy Statement
JRiver respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal
information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without
giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal
information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with
your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your
personal information.
Information Collection
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home,
postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date,
gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide
a service you requested.
When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously
indicated that you wish JRiver to remember your login and password. We don't
automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do
log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us
an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But
we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have
logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the JRiver
website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information
about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Information" below for more information.
JRiver personal information when you register with JRiver for a JRiver account,
when you use certain JRiver products or services, when you
register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to
be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for a
sweepstakes or other promotions, or when you submit your personal
information to JRiver for any other reason. From time to time, JRiver receives
personal information from business partners and vendors. JRiver only uses such
information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices
consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.
Access to certain JRiver web pages require a login and a password.
The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those
sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and JRiver.
Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified
below, your personal information may be retained by JRiver to verify
compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software
downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those
pages.
Notice
When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of
collection the purpose for the collection. JRiver will not transfer your
personal information to third parties.
We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct
marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given
us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with
this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not
consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at
the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with
the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative
action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes
other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
Cookies and Tracking Technology
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when
you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that
the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal
information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't
read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
Some parts of JRiver's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do
this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our
users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users
reach that information.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set
your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when
your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by
turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full
advantage of JRiver's website if you do so. In particular, you may be required
to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You
do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many
parts of our website, except access to certain of JRiver's web pages may
require a login and password.
How We Use Information Collected
JRiver uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests
for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our
website, keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software
updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about
either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your
needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to
send you direct marketing information or contact you for market research.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Because JRiver is a global company, your personal information may be shared with
other JRiver offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are
governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality
and data transfer agreements.
Your personal information is never shared outside JRiver without your permission,
except under conditions explained below. Inside JRiver, data is stored in
controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and
processed in the United States or any other country where JRiver,
its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.
JRiver may want to keep you up to date on the latest product
announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we
think you'd like to hear about. We will also disclose your personal
information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or
in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.
Data Security
Your JRiver account information is password-protected for your privacy and
security. JRiver safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites,
JRiver uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data
transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you
to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the
Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers,
and make sure you use a secure browser.
Children and Privacy
Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age
of 13. JRiver does not knowingly solicit personal information from children
under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.
Third Party Sites
JRiver's website contains links to other sites. JRiver does not share your
personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy
practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those
companies.
Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. Some of these
third-party sites may be co-branded with a JRiver logo, even though they are
not operated or maintained by JRiver. Although we choose our business
partners carefully, JRiver is not responsible for the privacy practices of
web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have
left our website, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third
party website to determine how they will handle any information they collect
from you.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
JRiver amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial
changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information
available by posting a notice on this site.
