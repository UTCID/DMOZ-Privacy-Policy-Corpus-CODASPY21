Introduction
Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”) develops and maintains websites and other Internet and mobile-based services (“BMI Sites and Services” or “BMI Site or Service”) for access and use by the general public and the industries that BMI serves including BMI’s affiliated songwriters, composers and music publishers, licensing customers and the music industry in general.  These Terms and Conditions of Use are generally applicable across all of BMI’s Sites and Services.  However, individual BMI Sites and Services may have additional and/or modified terms and conditions of use that are specific to that BMI Site or Service.  If there is a conflict between any provision under these Terms and Condition of Use and any additional or modified provision that is specific to a BMI Site or Service, the additional or modified provision governs. These Terms and Conditions of Use, together with any additional and/or modified terms and conditions of use for any specific BMI Site or Service, are referred to as the “Applicable Terms of Use.”
BMI Sites and Services, and the contents made available on the BMI Sites and Services, are protected under U.S. copyright law and other international, federal and state laws that protect intellectual property.
By accessing and/or using any of BMI’s Sites and Services, you agree that you are bound by the Applicable Terms of Use.  Any unauthorized use of BMI Sites and Services, including but not limited to, entry into BMI’s systems, misuse of passwords, misuse of any information posted on or to the BMI Sites and Services, or otherwise engaging in any activity relating to the BMI Sites and Services that is contrary to applicable law or regulations, or the terms of any agreement that you may have with BMI including, but not limited to, the Applicable Terms of Use, is strictly prohibited.
BMI reserves the right to change the Applicable Terms of Use at any time by publishing the modified version on the BMI Site or Service.  By using the BMI Sites or Service after any published
changes, you agree to be bound by the modified Applicable Terms of Use.

Trademarks
Broadcast Music, Inc., its abbreviation, “BMI” (whether stylized or not), and BMI.com, are registered trademarks of Broadcast Music, Inc.  All pages, including splash screens, page headers, and custom graphics on BMI Sites and Services are protected as trade dress under applicable law.  BMI Sites and Services may also contain other trademarks, service marks, or trade names, which may be owned by BMI or a third party. Other than as may be provided for under the Terms and Conditions for Use of BMI Logos for guidelines you may not use any of the trademarks, service marks, or trade names contained on BMI Sites and Service, or copy or imitate the design or any elements of the design that may be protected as trade dress under international, federal, or state laws, without the prior written consent of the owner.
General Use Parameters and Restrictions
All materials contained on BMI Sites and Services, which include, among other things, images, illustrations, designs, icons, photographs, audio clips, video clips, articles, documents, products, software, services and written and other materials that are part of a BMI Site or Service, are the intellectual property of BMI or its partners or affiliates.  Except as expressly authorized under the Applicable Terms of Use, you may not use all or any portion of the contents of BMI Sites and Services without prior written permission from BMI.
Access to and use of BMI Sites and Services that are open to the public:  For purposes of the Applicable Terms and Conditions, BMI Sites and Services are considered open to the public if you do not need an account, a username and password, or some other special relationship with BMI in order to gain access to the BMI Site or Service.  With respect to BMI Sites and Services that are open to the public, so long as you comply with the Applicable Terms of Use, BMI grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to enter, display, and use any publicly available BMI Sites and Services, but only for personal and informational purposes.  Business tools that may be made available publicly, such as affiliation applications and other forms, can be used for the purposes for which they are intended.
Other than in accordance with this limited license granted for this limited purpose, you will not copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit or distribute all or any portion of the BMI Sites and Services for any commercial purpose, including but not limited to, text, images, audio, video, software, applications, or source code, in any way without BMI’s prior express written permission.  Other than as may be permitted through an RSS feed or BMI API or similar service, you will not “mirror,” “frame,” or otherwise display or make available any of the contents of the BMI Sites and Services on or through any other site or service.  You will not link to BMI Sites and Services except as permitted under BMI’s policy for linking to BMI Sites and Services below.
You will not interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of any BMI Site or Service.  You will not circumvent any technical measures designed to restrict access, or otherwise attempt to gain access, to any BMI Sites and Services that are not open to the public, as these BMI Sites and Services may contain information that is proprietary, confidential, or is otherwise specifically intended for a particular individual or entity.
If you breach any of the Applicable Terms and Conditions, any license or right to access and use BMI Sites and Services is terminated and/or revoked immediately.  Upon termination or revocation, you will immediately cease accessing and/or using BMI Sites and Services and will immediately destroy any downloaded and/or printed materials.
Additional terms applicable to the BMI searchable song title database:  The searchable song title database provides access to certain song title registration information on musical works in the BMI repertoire, including foreign works registered with BMI and arrangements of works that are in the public domain.  The information is generally (although not necessarily) updated every day. The information can change and musical works can be added or removed from the BMI repertoire.
BMI is the owner of all rights in the searchable song title database under all applicable international, federal, and state laws. The database is intended for research and information purposes in the form presented.  The information contained in the database has been provided to BMI from a variety of sources, and BMI makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with respect to its accuracy or completeness of the information other than to determine what musical compositions are licensed by BMI through the last update.  BMI specifically disclaims any and all liability for any loss or damages which may be incurred, directly or indirectly, as a result of the use of the information in this database for any other purpose, or for any omissions or errors contained in the database and all use of the BMI Site is solely at the risk of the user.
By starting a query against BMI’s searchable song title database, you are indicating that you understand these limitations and you waive any and all claims of any kind and nature against BMI, its officers, employees, affiliates or licensees, with respect to your use of this database or the information provided.
You also agree that you will not copy, distribute, download, publish, modify, reformat, reconfigure, extract, incorporate into other software, databases or online material, or otherwise appropriate, the database in any way. You may not create, generate, or compile any source code version of the database or any part thereof, and you will not assist others in doing so.  You will only run manual queries through the interface that BMI provides.  You will not decompile or reverse-engineer the application(s) that provide access to the database or circumvent or attempt to circumvent any applications or processes that BMI may employ to track or limit access to the database.  You will not create any direct links to query results from any other site or service.  You will not develop or run scripts to automatically query the database, and you will not capture, scrape, download or otherwise copy and/or store any query results for any purpose whatsoever.
If you breach any of these additional terms and conditions, any license or right to access and use the searchable song title database is immediately terminated and/or revoked.  Upon termination or revocation, you will immediately cease accessing and/or using the searchable song title database and will immediately destroy any downloaded and/or printed materials.
Additional terms applicable to BMI Sites and Services that are not open to the public:  For purposes of the Applicable Terms and Conditions, BMI Sites and Services are not considered open to the public if you need an account, a username and password, or some other special relationship with BMI in order to gain access to the BMI Site or Service.  With respect to BMI Sites and Services that are not open to the public, when BMI grants you access by assigning you a username and password or otherwise establishing access to the BMI Site or Service for you, and provided you comply with the Applicable Terms of Use, BMI is granting you a non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to enter, display, and use any the BMI Site or Service.  This limited license is granted solely for the purpose for which access was provided.  For example, if BMI grants you access to an online service or tool that provides information relating to your account as a songwriter or composer affiliate or as a licensee, the purpose for providing access is to facilitate the exchange of information relating to your account between you and BMI.
By accessing and using the non-public BMI Site or Service, you are consenting to the electronic exchange of information between you and BMI.  You will not knowing provide false or misleading information to BMI on or through the BMI Site or Service.  You recognize and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and password, and you understand that transmissions over the Internet may be intercepted by third parties through no fault of BMI.  You also agree that you will not circumvent any technical measures designed to restrict, control, or track your access, and you will not otherwise attempt to gain access to anyone else’s account or to other BMI Sites and Services that are not open to the public.
If you breach any of these additional terms and conditions, BMI may terminate your privileges with respect to accessing and using a non-public BMI Site or Services without notice to you, and you agree that BMI’s termination of your privileges does not excuse any separate obligations you may have to BMI (e.g., making license fee payment or reporting under the terms of a license).  Upon termination or revocation, you will immediately cease accessing and/or using the non-public BMI Site of Service.
Additional terms applicable to material submitted to BMI Sites and Services: BMI does not assume any responsibility for any of the materials posted on BMI Sites and Services by any third party, including the legality, originality, reliability or appropriateness of the materials.  BMI may monitor or review any areas on a BMI Site or Service in which users transmit or post communications or communicate solely with each other for the purpose of promoting the efficiency, usefulness, appropriateness of use and compliance with the Applicable Terms of Use.  However, BMI does not undertake to monitor or review every posting or communication, and BMI disclaims any liability related to the content of any such postings and communications.
If you submit material to a BMI Site or Service, you are granting to BMI, on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis, all rights necessary to publish, display, and/or make all or any portion of the material available to the public on or in connection with the applicable BMI Site or Service.  You warrant and represent that you have all rights necessary to grant BMI this license.  You also warrant and represent that you are not infringing anyone else’s rights, and you will indemnify and hold BMI harmless from and against any claims relating to the material you post.
You understand that the rights that you give to BMI to publish, display and/or make the material available to the public do not impose any obligation on BMI to do so.  BMI reserves the right to decide whether, when, and how to publish, display, and/or make the material available.  BMI also reserves the right to remove or disable access to any material at any time and for any reason without notice to you.  You agree not post or submit to any BMI Site or Service any content which (a) is libelous, defamatory, invasive of privacy, or is obscene, pornographic, abusive or threatening; (b) violates or infringes any person’s legal rights or the legal rights of any entity, including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks and patents; (c) violates any law; (d) advocates any unlawful activity; or (e) solicits funds for, or otherwise advocates for or against, any organization, goods or services.
If you breach any of these additional terms and conditions with respect to material you submit, BMI may immediately terminate your right and/or ability to submit materials to a BMI Site or Service.  Upon termination or revocation, you will immediately cease accessing and/or using BMI Sites and Services and will immediately destroy any downloaded and/or printed materials.
