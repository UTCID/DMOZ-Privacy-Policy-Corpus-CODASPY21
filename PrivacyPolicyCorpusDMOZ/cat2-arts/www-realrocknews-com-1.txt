The use of cookies by this website is primarily for identification of visitors, so that they can be remembered by this website, which allows certain user choices and preferences to remain consistent, and improve the experience of using this website.
The visitor assumes responsibility for the personal data of third parties published or shared through this website, and declares to have the right to communicate or broadcast them, thus relieving the website operator of all responsibility.

Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a service that is provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) for website operators that allows for the collection of visitor usage data. The Google Analytics service is employed by this website so that we can understand how visitors use and interact with it. This data can be used to improve visitor experience. Data collected is anonymous. Google may, at its discretion, make use of the data collected to contextualize and personalize advertisements from its own advertising network.
Google Analytics anonymizes visitor IP addresses where it is appropriate and necessary. This is accomplished by shortening visitor’s IP addresses within member states of the European Union, or in other contracting states to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full and complete IP address be sent to a Google server and then shortened for visitors within the United States of America.
Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting is also used here on RealRockNews.com. You can opt out by visiting: https://www.google.com/settings/ads
Users can completely block Google Analytics tracking by using Google’s Analytics Opt-out browser add-on which can be obtained by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/
