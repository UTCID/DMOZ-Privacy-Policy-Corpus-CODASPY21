These include Chopra-specific uses such as authenticating you and recognizing your preferences when you visit our Digital Properties, customizing your experiences with our Services, analyzing website analytics and such other purposes as set forth elsewhere in this Policy. Chopra Vendors use Tracking Technology to fulfill their service obligations to us. Other third parties use Tracking Technology for interest-based advertising, to provide their products and services directly to you or for other purposes as set forth in their respective terms and policies.Tracking Technology includes:Cookies, which are small strings of data sent by a web server that is stored in your computer's Internet browser and provided back to the web server to uniquely identify your browser each time you encounter a page accessed by that web server. We may use session cookies, which are temporary cookies that disappear after you close your browser, and/or persistent cookies, which are reloaded when you open a new browser session. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set – all browsers are different, so check the settings of your particular browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Disabling cookies, however, may make certain functionality provided by us unavailable or suboptimal. Blocking cookies will not prevent the use of other technologies on your browser or device.Web beacons (also known as single-pixels (1x1), clear GIFs or pixel tags), which are electronic images embedded in a webpage or HTML-based e-mail. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view and the webpage where the beacon is placed. While you may not decline web beacons, you may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. As mentioned above, if you disable the cookies associated with a beacon, some functionality may not work properly.Other similar technologies such as local storage objects (“LSOs”), including "flash cookies," authentication tokens” and HTML5 local storage. Like cookies, these technologies are stored on your computer, albeit in different parts of your device, and perform similar functions. They can also be used to store certain information about your preferences. Your Internet browser may allow you to disable HTML5 or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage by changing your browser settings. To manage Flash LSOs please click here. Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of our products and services.Third parties that use Tracking Technology may engage in interest-based advertising ("IBA"). IBA involves the collection of data over time and across browsers and devices, and the use of such data, often along with other data, to infer consumer interests. These inferred interests are used to provide relevant advertising to you across various browsers and devices attributed to you. If you would like to learn more about IBA, or to opt out of this practice from third-party companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Program for this browser, please visit the DAA Consumer Choice Page here or opt out here. If you are in the EU, please visit here. With respect to IBA conducted by Google, if you wish to opt out of such personalized ads you may opt out of Google Marketing Platform's use of cookies by visiting the Google Marketing Platform opt-out page here. You may also be able to simply click on the ‘x’ that is typically in the top right corner of an ad and click on the action you want. Other ad platforms have similar mechanisms for managing the advertisements you see. To learn more about IBA on your mobile device and how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile applications by certain third-party companies, please download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android, or click here. You can also opt out of having certain information collected through mobile applications for behavioral advertising purposes directly on your mobile device via the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting on iOS devices or the “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” settings on Android devices.We use Google Analytics to help us better understand activity on our Digital Properties. Data collected via Google Analytics is used by us according to this Policy and may also be used by Google according to its policies. For more information about Google Analytics, please click here. To opt out of the collection and processing of data by Google Analytics click here.Please note that if you delete cookies, reset your device identifier or use another browser or device, you may need to repeat your opt-out choices. If you opt out of IBA, you will still receive ads, but these ads may be less relevant to you. If you disable cookies or opt out of IBA by any of the avenues set forth above, we will still collect data by other means and for the purposes set forth in this Policy.To disable collection of precise location information from your mobile device, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track your online activities over time and across browsers and devices. Our websites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using our websites and after you leave our properties.5. How to Access, Change or Delete Your Information and Messaging PreferencesIf you have an Account, you may view and directly edit certain information we have about you, such as your email address, in your Profile. You can also contact us directly at support@chopra.com to edit your information.You may request removal of information you provide for public display on our Digital Properties as set forth in the section entitled Who Else May Have Access to Your Information by contacting us at privacy@chopra.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove such information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so.You also have the right at any time to stop us from contacting you by email for promotional purposes either by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email communication or in your Account settings on certain of our Digital Properties. Notwithstanding your indicated email marketing preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding Chopra, including, for example, order confirmations and notices of updates to this Policy or the Terms if we choose to provide such notices to you in this manner.At any time, you can manage our ability to send you push notifications by turning off the notification settings in the relevant mobile application or in the device settings of your mobile device. If you choose not to receive push notifications, you may still receive in-app notifications.Any changes you request will take effect within 48 hours.6. Children’s PrivacyWe do not intentionally collect or maintain PII from individuals who are under sixteen (16) years old. Protecting the privacy of minors is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that we are holding PII of someone under 16 years of age, we will take steps to permanently remove that PII from our records. Should you, as a user's parent or legal guardian, become aware that a user who is under the age of 16 has provided us with PII, please notify us immediately by any means set forth below.7. How We Protect Your InformationChopra takes precautions to ensure that your PII is secured. We use a variety of industry-standard technical, contractual, administrative and physical security measures and procedures to help protect your PII from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. We restrict access to PII to those employees or contractors who need access to perform their job functions. Please note that despite our best efforts, no one can guarantee the security of PII. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of PII at any time.8. Links to Other Websites and ServicesOur Digital Properties may contain links to third-party websites. We do not control the privacy policies or practices of such websites. You should review the terms and policies of any property you visit before providing any PII on such property. Chopra is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and we provide these links solely for your convenience.9.
