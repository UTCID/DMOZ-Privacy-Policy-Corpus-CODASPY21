SiWC Code of Conduct
Your attendance at the Surrey International Writers’ Conference in any capacity constitutes your agreement to abide by this code of conduct.
* To be as helpful as possible and to foster a positive attitude and experience for all. As this is a conference where the new writer and multi-published best-selling author mix and mingle, coming together in the spirit of learning and advancing the craft of writing is essential.
* To speak with tact, manners and discretion, with language that is appropriate to a mixed audience, and put the needs of the conference above personal opinions or philosophies. Differing opinions are welcome, but personal attacks, inflammatory remarks, and the stirring up of controversy are not. We are an organization that values diversity, inclusion, and acceptance and we expect the highest standards of behaviour of everyone who is involved with our conference.
* To discuss and/or pitch personal writing projects only within a professional boundary, not ever excessively selling personal products, projects, or services.
* To arrive for all events, workshops, appointments, and commitments on time, and to come and go quietly if you must leave for any reason while an event is in session.
* To wear the conference-provided name tag at all times.
* To turn off or silence cell phones during workshops, appointments, and keynotes.
* To be conscious of the health and welfare of your fellow conference-goers by washing your hands regularly and/or using hand sanitizer.
* SiWC is a scent-sensitive environment. Please avoid wearing or using heavily-scented products at the conference.
Harassment Policy
The Surrey International Writers' Conference promotes a collegial, welcoming environment for attendees, presenters, volunteers and staff alike. Harassment, defined generally as any behaviour that annoys, alarms, or threatens another person or group, and any other behaviour that causes excessive discomfort to other people; adversely affects SiWC’s relationship with its guests, its venues, its partners, or the public; breaks any applicable law; or causes significant disruption to conference operations will not be tolerated.
The SiWC Society reserves the right to revoke conference passes without recompense and to deny offenders attendance at future events. Your attendance at SiWC constitutes your agreement to abide by our code of conduct.
SiWC prides itself on being a safe event. If you encounter any behaviour that makes you uncomfortable, please report it immediately to a board member, the conference coordinator, or the conference administrator.

SiWC Accessibility Policy
SIWC is committed to supporting and assisting individuals with disabilities to attend and participate in our conference.
Our conference strives to be consistent with the principles of independence, dignity, integration and equality of opportunity for all.
Our conference has identified an accessibility coordinator who has received training in this area and is the primary person for any questions or feedback. As always, feel free to approach any member of the conference board.
All volunteers receive information about accessibility as a part of their training.
In order that we may better serve anyone needing an accessibility service and/or accommodation please alert the board or conference administrator of any needs we should be aware of. This may include any of the following:
Assistive devices
People with disabilities may use their personal assistive devices when accessing our conference.
In cases where the assistive device presents a significant and unavoidable health or safety concern or may not be permitted for other reasons, other measures will be used to ensure the person with a disability can access our conference.
We are committed to ensuring that any facility where the conference operates meets accessibility guidelines. This includes access to parking, rooms, washrooms, elevators and access to public transit.
Communication
We will communicate with people with disabilities in ways that take into account their disability.
We will work with the person with a disability to determine what method of communication works for them.
If you require communication such as sign language interpreters, please inform the conference ahead of time so this can be arranged and appropriate number of interpreters is available.
Service animals
We welcome people with disabilities and their service animals. Service animals are allowed on the parts of our premises that are open to the public.
When we cannot easily identify that an animal is a service animal, our staff may ask a person to provide documentation (template, letter or form) from a regulated health professional that confirms the person needs the service animal for reasons relating to their disability.
Support Workers
Individuals who require assistance may have their support worker attend the session at no additional cost.
Allergies
The SIWC is sensitive to allergies. Out of respect for all participants, please do not bring nut items and or wear perfumes/scent.
Meals at the conference hotel are marked including being vegetarian, gluten free etc. If you have dietary concerns/issues that require special meals you must let the conference know ahead of time.
