Liverpool Philharmonic Environmental Sustainability Policy
Policy Statement
The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic is committed to fully understanding and minimising its impact upon the environment through our Environmental Sustainability Policy and Action Plan. We will strive to reach the highest practicably achievable standards in environmental sustainability throughout our business operations and develop a positive culture of environmental awareness, personal and corporate responsibility across our employees, artists, performers, promoters, audiences, participants, clients and contractors, and anyone else who may be affected by our actions or activities.
We will adopt a robust and systemic approach to environmental sustainability management, complying with all relevant legislation and guidance, and striving for continuous and measurable improvement in our performance.
Our aims are to:
Reduce our environmental impacts in energy and water consumption, waste generation and disposal, acting responsibly and efficiently throughout our company and venues
Promote a proactive sustainability culture through continued employee engagement and focused initiatives
Require consideration of this policy and industry good practice through procurement of equipment, goods and services
Encourage the use of environmentally friendly forms of transport by employees, audiences, artists and visitors to our venues
Communicate our environmental sustainability goals and results to our employees, customers, audiences and stakeholders
Benchmark our environmental sustainability impacts and performance with other UK orchestras and concert halls
To achieve our aims we will:
Ensure effective leadership of this policy by the Chief Executive, Executive Team, and Leadership Team with annual reporting to the Board of Trustees
Develop and implement an Environmental Sustainability Action Plan with time limited, measurable objectives and outcomes to be reviewed and updated annually
Establish Environmental Sustainability as a standing item at key meetings including Executive Team Business Review, Leadership Team and Health & Safety Committee
Operate a cross-organisation Environmental Sustainability Action Group chaired by the Executive Director Audiences & Development with quarterly meetings to coordinate and drive progress
Communicate our goals and results publicly through our Review of the Year
Draft updated: 30 September 2017
We're excited to be taking part in Arts Council England and Julie's Bicycle's Spotlight Programme, helping us reduce our environmental impact by setting ambitious targets to cut carbon emissions over the next few years. You can find out more here: https://bit.ly/2KdkTaA
