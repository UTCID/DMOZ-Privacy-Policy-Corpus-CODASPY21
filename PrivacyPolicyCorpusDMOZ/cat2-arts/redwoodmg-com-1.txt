Information collected automatically. Your IP address and non-identifying information about your use of RMG Sites may be collected automatically using tracking technologies, such as cookies. Your website browser software can be set to reject all cookies; however, cookies can allow you to take advantage of some of the site’s essential features, which may not work if you reject cookies.
Information collected from other sources. We may combine information about you from RMG Sites, information collected offline, or from external parties.
How We Use Your Information
RMG uses the information we collect for the following purposes:
To provide you with the RMG show products and services you request.
To offer and provide information about similar and/or related products and services.
To customize and improve your experience on RMG Sites.
To generally improve our shows, products, and RMG Sites and other internal business purposes.
To notify and report to authorities under our legal obligations.
Under European data protection laws, RMG must have a legal basis to process your Personal Data. The legal basis that applies in a particular instance will depend on the specific purposes described above for which RMG is processing your Personal Data:
In certain instances, RMG may ask for your consent to collect and process your Personal Data. Should you choose to provide your consent, you may later withdraw your consent by contacting us as described in the “Your Privacy Choices” section. Please note that the withdrawal of consent will not affect processing which has already occurred.
In other instances, the processing of your Personal Data may be necessary in order to comply with an applicable law or regulation or for the performance of a contract to which you are subject. You may not be able to opt out of this processing, or your choice to opt out may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation otherwise owed to you.
In yet other instances, RMG may process your Personal Data based on RMG’s legitimate interests in communicating with you about our shows, products, and services, and about event and other related opportunities. You have the right to opt out of all such processing of your Personal Data. You may do so by contacting us as described in the “Your Privacy Choices” section.
Processing operations may include the recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of Personal Data. The Personal Data we collect about you may be stored for ten years following the most recent interaction we have had with you, after which point it will be archived only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, in accordance with applicable laws.
Information We Share
RMG does not sell or disclose your Personal Data to third parties without your consent, except:
To third-party service providers to provide services and information on our sites, including online marketing and advertising, and to support our business operations. We require these parties to handle Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
To affiliates to offer and provide information about related products and services. We do not share Personal Data from countries that require consent, unless consent has been obtained in advance of sharing with affiliates. We require these parties to handle your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
To our distribution channel partners in connection with the communication and sale of our shows, products, and services. We require these parties to handle your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
To governing regulatory authorities or as may otherwise be necessary for RMG to comply with a legal obligation or demand.
In the event RMG decides to reorganize or divest our business through sale, merger, or acquisition, RMG may share Personal Data about you with actual or prospective purchasers. We will require any actual or prospective purchasers to treat this Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
You can find all our third-party service providers and affiliates here.
Your Privacy Choices
You have the right to see and get a copy of the Personal Data about you that we maintain as well as to ask us to make corrections to inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data about you. You have the right to receive data that you have provided to us in a machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller. You may also request the erasure of your Personal Data or the restriction of its processing, or object to the processing of Personal Data about you.

Accessing Our Sites Globally
By using this site, you understand that your Personal Data will be collected, stored, and processed in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations. RMG may transmit Personal Data about you to third-party service providers and affiliates worldwide. These providers and affiliates may in turn transmit Personal Data about you to other providers and affiliates. Some providers and affiliates may be in countries that do not ensure an adequate level of data protection. Nevertheless, all providers and affiliates are required to treat Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. To obtain additional information regarding the safeguards we have in place for cross-border transfers of Personal Data, please contact us using the information provided in the “Your Privacy Choices” section.
