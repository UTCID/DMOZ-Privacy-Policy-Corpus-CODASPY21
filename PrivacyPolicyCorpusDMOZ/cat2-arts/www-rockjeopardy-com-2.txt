Canadian Addendum
If you are a resident of Canada, the following additions, alterations and modifications apply to our processing of your personal information in lieu of the relevant sections of the Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Privacy Policy and the provisions of this Addendum, the provisions of this Addendum shall govern and control.
1. Collection of Information
Section 1(A)(i) of the Privacy Policy is deleted and replaced as follows:
Information SPE, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect may include: personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, address, full payment account number, gender, age, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("Personal Information"). Personal Information, including, without limitation, SPE-Collected PI (defined below), once "de-identified" (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is non-Personal Information ("non-Personal Information") and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent any non-Personal Information is combined by or on behalf of SPE with Personal Information SPE itself collects directly from you on the Service ("SPE-Collected PI"), SPE will treat the combined data as SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy
If you use a "share with a friend" or similar feature on our website, we may collect your name and email address, as well as the name and email address of the recipient. We do not use the names or email addresses submitted in these circumstances for any other purpose without the consent of you or the email recipient to do so. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message from you.
2. Disclosure of Information
We and the third parties we employ to perform functions on our behalf may disclose your Personal Information (i) if we are required or permitted to do so by applicable US, Canadian or other law or legal process, and (ii) to Canadian, US or other foreign law enforcement authorities, courts and other government officials based on a lawful disclosure request.
