This personal information will be stored on the Spektrix Ticketing System and not shared with any third party organisation. You have the opportunity to review your personal information through your account and make necessary amendments at any time. You also have the opportunity to delete your account at any time. When creating your account, you will be given the choice of how we contact you, either through telephone, email or postal address. When you purchase a ticket, you will be asked to opt in to our terms and conditions.
