A cookie is almost like your identification card, telling a website when the same user has returned.What Is The Reason For Cookies?Cookies generally make websites faster and easier for individual users. They can be used to tailor the website’s content to your preferences/needs, speed up the use of the site or, alternatively, are necessary for it to function correctly (for example: Remembering to keep you logged into the site whilst you browse or for remembering the products in your shopping cart when you change pages).Companies normally use cookies because they save both the website and the user time – making the overall visiting and browsing experience more efficient and enjoyable.Websites can also use cookies to track visitors and how they interact with the site (which pages they click and how long they visit, for example), allowing the website to then analyse the anonymous data and tailor the content/layout to their audience. Hopefully you can see by now thatthey help make websites, like ours, better.Are Cookies Dangerous?NO. Cookies are just small pieces of text. They are not computer programs or viruses, so they cannot be ran as code or used to spread viruses.Can Cookies Compromise User Privacy?As previously mentioned, cookies are small text files that are stored on the individual user’s hard drive.Because they cannot run code or do anything malicious, a cookie cannot read other information saved on the hard drive, or get a user’s e-mail address etc.They only contain and transfer to the server as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to a certain web site.If you would like to read more about cookies then please visit: www.aboutcookies.orgAnswers CookiesThese cookies are used to analyze data on our users to help provide a better user experience.Cookie NameDescriptionmx_uuidAnonymous unique user identifieradcUsed to sticky a user to a geographically close datacentermode_idUsed to control UX feature testsmx_cookieUsed to determine if user has been given opportunity to opt out of consentsPHPSESSIDThe PHPSESSID cookie is native to PHP and enables websites to store serialised state data.
