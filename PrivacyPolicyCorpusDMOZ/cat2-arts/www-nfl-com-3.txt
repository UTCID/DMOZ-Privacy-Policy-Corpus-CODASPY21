NCAM is provides training to necessary individuals on an ongoing basis regarding accessible website design and maintenance. Furthermore, our Website will continue to be assessed on a recurring basis from both an engineering and user-experience basis, including the use of assistive technology (such as screen readers and screen magnifiers), and the involvement of users with disabilities who use such assistive technologies.
