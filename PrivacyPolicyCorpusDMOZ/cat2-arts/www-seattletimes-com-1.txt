Digital accessQ: How do I search for an article?A: You can search for articles on seattletimes.com by selecting Search at the top of the page; then on the results page, refine your search by Date, Type, Author or Section. If you are a subscriber, you have two more options. Print Replica for web or mobile apps includes a 90-day archive of editions. And The Seattle Times Newspaper Archive gives subscribers access to a collection of digitized printed pages dating back to 1896.
Q: How often is the website updated?A: The site is updated 24/7 with stories, photos, video, blog entries, reader comments and other news.
Q: Do you post all of the content from the print edition online?A: We publish all of the stories, columns and photos produced by Seattle Times staff, but some of the wire services do not allow us to post their material online. So the print edition contains some syndicated columns, graphics and other content not available online.
Q: Why does The Seattle Times require a subscription for complete digital access?A: The expenses associated with creating unique, original news content are significant. Traditionally, the great majority of the cost was underwritten by advertising. With the changing media business model, that revenue no longer covers costs to the same degree. As a result, in order to maintain the same high quality, unique news gathering, it is necessary to charge for unlimited digital access, just as is done for the printed product.
Q: If I am already a home delivery subscriber, how do I get digital access?A: Every print subscription includes unlimited access to seattletimes.com, Seattle Times mobile apps for iOS and Android, and Print Replica for iPad and Android tablet, an online version of the printed paper. To get started log in to your subscriber account.  If you don't have an email associated with your subscription, link your print and digital subscription. Digital access allows you to read unlimited articles, log in to our apps, and manage your account online: schedule delivery holds, go paperless, update payment info, pay your bill and more.
Q: If I am already registered on seattletimes.com for newsletters, commenting and forums, will I have unlimited access to seattletimes.com?A: Seattletimes.com requires a subscription for unlimited access.

If you are already a subscriber, you can use your subscriber login for unlimited access to seattletimes.com and to manage your account online. And you can log in to our mobile apps and Print Replica. If you are a print subscriber but don't have a digital account or when you log in you are not recognized as a subscriber, go to Link your print and digital subscriptions to get set up to enjoy all our digital products.

If you created a free account, you can manage your profile information and comment on articles. To become a full subscriber with unlimited access to all Seattle Times digital products, see our offers.
Q: If I currently subscribe, but don't want online access, will I be affected?A: No. Digital access is automatically included in all home delivery subscriptions but not required. If you choose to enjoy the benefits of a digital account at any point, it is available to you.
Q: As a subscriber, will I still see ads on seattletimes.com?A: Yes. We operate the largest newsroom in the region, and subscriptions alone do not cover the costs. We still rely on ad revenue to continue offering a high level of service and quality journalism, and ads help us bring it to you at an affordable price.
Q: I currently subscribe and there are multiple people in my household. Do we all have unlimited digital access?A: You may share your subscription with the same unlimited access privileges with one family member in your household.

Commenting on articles on seattletimes.comWhy does seattletimes.com have comments?
We want the stories, visuals, columns and editorials we publish to be a starting point for conversation, not a dead end. One of the things that separates seattletimes.com from the printed newspaper is our ability to interact with you. That means answering your questions, hearing your concerns and listening to your ideas. We also know the value of neighbors being able to engage in enlightened conversation about the issues in our region. Commenting on stories is part of that community conversation.
If I am already registered to comment on seattletimes.com or receive newsletters, will I have unlimited access to seattletimes.com?
A: A subscription is required for unlimited access to seattletimes.com. Your seattletimes.com registration is not a subscription. You can find subscription options here.
If you are already a subscriber, you can simply use your subscriber login to comment on articles and manage newsletter preferences (including Subscriber Rewards). Or you can link your existing seattletimes.com registration to your subscriber account. Get started here.
Why was my comment removed? What does it take to get suspended or banned?
Please refer to our Code of Conduct, which outlines the rules for commenting.
Due to the volume of comments received and reviewed, we cannot respond to individual questions about why a specific comment was allowed or removed.
We no longer have the staff resources to consider a commenter's past conduct when making a decision to suspend or ban them. If you break the rules once, you'll be suspended; if you break them again, you'll be banned. In both cases, you will be notified of the decision and the reason behind it.
How do I report a comment that breaks the rules?
Bring it to our attention by clicking on the "report" link that appears with each comment. We will review it as soon as possible (at times there could be a delay of a few hours).
Who reviews the reported comments?
The Seattle Times' digital audience team and other staff in the newsroom.
As a Seattle Times subscriber, can I still be suspended or banned from commenting?
Yes, the Code of Conduct applies to all users, regardless of subscription status. If you violate the Code of Conduct, your commenting privileges may be suspended or revoked, but you will still be able to read articles.
Will you tell me when Ive been suspended or banned? Will you tell me why? And can I be reinstated?
If you are suspended or banned from commenting, we will notify you via the email address associated with your commenting account, and we will note which provision of the Code of Conduct was violated.
The first violation of the Code of Conduct results in a 24-hour suspension -- essentially, a warning. If you break the rules again after that, you'll be banned. Bans are permanent.
Why are you censoring peoples opinions?
The Seattle Times reserves the right to allow or disallow any kind of content that doesn't meet its standards as outlined in the Code of Conduct, Terms of Service and this FAQ. The Times is under no obligation to publish every comment it receives. Generally, a comment is removed not because of the opinion it expresses but because it violates those basic rules.
What about my right to free speech?
The right to free speech described in the First Amendment concerns the relationship between the U.S. government and its citizens. Any private business can require certain standards of conduct, as we do with our Code of Conduct.
Why cant I comment on wire stories?
As of May 15, 2017, The Seattle Times is not accepting reader comments on news stories originating with The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg and other wire services. The intent is to focus our newsroom's time and energy on discussions related to news stories covered by our staff, and foster constructive conversation around local news and issues.
Why dont you make commenters use real names?
We have considered requiring real names, and decided not to for a few reasons.
First, we don't have the resources to independently verify that names used by commenters are indeed real. Some sites have tried to get around this by connecting comments to Facebook profiles. But Facebook's verification mechanisms are imperfect as well, and not everyone has a Facebook profile. We think you shouldn't have to join another site to have conversations on ours. Plus, our commenting vendor  unlike Facebook  keeps users data private.
Another reason for not requiring real names: Research on commenting communities shows that using real names doesn't actually compel people to act more civilly toward each other. Comments on Facebook posts offer countless examples of this.
There's also evidence that, when commenters are all using their real names, people with names that suggest they're women or people of color are more likely to be harassed, and we don't want to invite those kinds of attacks into our community.
The folks who built our commenting tool published an enlightening piece on this subject; we invite you to read it.
What is the "respect" link for?
This allows you to convey respect for a particularly thoughtful, well-reasoned contribution from a fellow reader. You may use it once per comment.
Why dont you pre-screen all of the comments?
We do actively moderate and pre-screen comments on some stories when there's a high likelihood the discussion will stray off topic. But we don't have the staff resources to read and approve every comment on our site before it is posted. That's why we provide readers the tools to help us keep the conversation civil through the "report" and "respect" links. We encourage readers to report comments that violate the Code of Conduct.
Why do you require registration in order to comment?
It helps keep spam out of the comments. It allows us to better control the legitimacy of commenters, and to more easily suspend or ban those who break the rules. And adding the step of having to be registered and logged in deters the hit-and-run troll.
Can I comment with my subscriber account, or do I need to register separately?
Your subscription includes access to post comments. You do not need to register separately. However, if someone else in your household would like to comment under their own identity, they would have to register separately.
Can I change the way I view the comments?
Yes. By default, you'll see featured comments first. If no comments have been featured on that thread yet, you'll see all the comments chronologically beginning with the newest first. At the top of each comment thread (above the first comment), you'll see options to sort the comments in other ways.
Can I see another user's commenting history?
No. However, you can see your own commenting history, and you can see how long someone has been a member of the commenting community.
Can I edit or remove a comment after I've posted it?
You have the option to edit a comment for up to 5 minutes after you post it. But you cannot remove a comment, so please be absolutely sure you want to make such a comment publicly. Comments are indexed by search engines, and they also could remain on our site for many years.
Why do comments close 72 hours after an article is published?
You can still read others' thoughts after 72 hours, but indeed will not be able to contribute your own. Limiting commenting on old stories keeps our moderators focused on the stories that have the most readers at the time.
Why do old stories not have comment threads anymore?
We changed commenting systems in April 2019. Unfortunately, issues with technology, different vendors and resources kept us from being able to preserve old comments when we made this change.
What are some other ways to share my thoughts on news stories and topics of the day?
If you'd like to give input on issues raised in an article, and that article doesn't have a comment thread, you've still got several other opportunities. Here are a few of them:
Contact the author of the article. Seattle Times writers' contact info is at the bottom of their articles.
Share the article on your social media channels and discuss it there.
Write a letter to the editor.
Submit a guest column to be considered for publication on the Opinion page.
Use this form under "Contact the newsroom."
Reach out to any of us individually. Staff contact info is here.
Commenting code of conductThe Seattle Times commenting community is a civil space where people who live in or otherwise care about the Pacific Northwest can have meaningful, informed conversations about the facts presented in The Times.
Our newsroom strives to reflect the vibrancy and diversity of the region and tell the story of its continuing transformation. We aim to be a model of innovative, audience-supported regional journalism, to strengthen democracy, build community, encourage constructive discourse and enrich peoples lives.
Seattle Times staff retains the prerogative to determine what is published on seattletimes.com. To that end, just as we hold our journalism to high ethical standards, we hold comments published alongside our work to high ethical standards.
This is a living document. We expect to revise these guidelines in response to community feedback and behavior.
Tips for constructive commenting
Our commenters represent a variety of identities, perspectives and life experiences, which inform the well-reasoned opinions they share with their neighbors on our site. Heres how you can help us foster an inclusive, respectful environment for everyone who visits or participates in the comments:
Read the entire article before commenting.
Show others the kindness you would want them to extend to you. Consider what impact your words could have on other commenters, on people featured in the article, and on their loved ones. Would your comment do justice to your own humanity if someone expressed those exact same sentiments, in the exact same way, to you?
Provide information that enhances or adds context to the article, or that could advance our future reporting on the subject at hand.
Ask questions that are related to whats in the article.
Respond to the substance of a comment, not the person making it.
Be careful when employing sarcasm; tone doesnt always come across in writing.
Flag comments that violate the rules. This is the quickest way to draw our attention to a problem  far more effective than emailing us, tweeting at us or getting into a prolonged fight with a fellow commenter.
Unacceptable behavior
If your comment reflects any of the following, it will be removed and you may be suspended from commenting on seattletimes.com. If you violate this code of conduct repeatedly, you will be permanently banned.
Disparaging an identity or ideology, or any other behavior that embodies or emboldens bigotry. This includes, but is not limited to racism, misogyny, ableism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and transphobia.
Harassment, bullying, insults, name-calling, or any other personal or ad hominem attack. If you believe you have the stronger point, write it concisely in your own comment and move on.
Trolling  including doxxing, sealioning, whataboutism and aggressively instigating unproductive interactions.
Deliberately disrupting or distorting the discussion by using all capital letters or excessive symbols.
Violating someones privacy, including posting their personal information.
Causing, inciting, threatening or advocating for violence or harm.
Obscenities, profanities and slurs, including with symbols in place of letters, and including acronyms that are commonly known to represent profanity.
Posting copyrighted material.
Comments promoting a product or service, or soliciting money. Campaign ads or other such promotional material.
Spam of any kind, including posting the same comment more than once or repetitively posting a single term with slight variations to test the rules.
Promoting, encouraging or making light of illegal activity.
Straying off topic.
Presenting falsehoods as facts, including promoting or perpetuating conspiracy theories.
Impersonating someone else.
Abusing the flagging system  for example, reporting a comment that doesnt break the rules simply because you disagree with it or dislike the person who wrote it.
A commenting history that indicates that you visit seattletimes.com solely to disparage journalists or The Times in the comments without contributing anything to community discussions. (Respectful, constructive criticism is encouraged.)
Comments longer than 3,000 characters. Please do not break a longer comment into multiple shorter posts; they will be deleted.
Seattle Times staff retain sole discretion to moderate, suspend or ban anyone whose behavior we determine to be a detriment to the atmosphere of our site. We will take into account both individual comments and a commenters past behavior when making these decisions.
More information about how commenting works
Comments containing links to sites that do not conform to these guidelines will also be removed. In some cases, we might pre-moderate comments containing links.
If a comment is removed, all replies to that comment are hidden.
Decisions to remove a comment, or to suspend a user, are final. A user who has been banned may appeal to customercare@seattletimes.com to request the ban be changed to a suspension at our staffs discretion. A user may make only one such appeal; there are no third chances.
Stories from wire services, such as The Associated Press or New York Times, do not have comment threads. We are focusing our limited staff time on discussions around stories produced by The Seattle Times.
Comment threads automatically close to new submissions 72 hours after an article is published. Seattle Times staff may also use our discretion to close comments on an article at any time for a variety of ethical and/or practical reasons.
Talk to us
If you have questions about anything related to our commenting community, please email customercare@seattletimes.com.

How to submit a letter to the editorLetters to the editor are an important part of the Opinion section. Our readers share a wide range of perspectives on current issues.
Letters that are well-written, have a clear opinion and responsive to current events are more likely to be chosen for publication. The Seattle Times editors always try to give preference to the paper's critics in choosing letters to be published. Opinions that differ from those presented elsewhere on the editorial and opinion pages are also given priority. The Seattle Times also seeks to publish letters from a range of readers of diverse backgrounds. Letters represent The Seattle Times broad readership rather than serve as a platform for officials of organizations or government agencies.
When submitting a letter, please include the topic or headline and date of the article, editorial or opinion piece to which your letter refers.
Letters to the editor should be 200 words or fewer. A writer decreases his or her chances of being selected for publication if the letter exceeds that length. Please do not expect us to publish letters from a single writer more frequently than once every three months to give other readers a chance to express their opinions. If your letter is selected for publication, you may be contacted for identity verification or if we have questions about its content.
You may mail or email your letter, and all letters must include your full name (no initials), address and telephone number(s) for verification. Only your name and city of residence are published. Letters become the property of The Seattle Times and may be edited.

Writing guidelines: Dos and Donts
DO: Have an opinion and state it forcefully  Many letters submitted are explanations of an issue or a restatement of a news article, rather than knowledgeable arguments about an issue. Those wont make the cut.
DO: Be civil and constructive  Its perfectly appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks.
DO: Present an organized opinion  It's usually better to begin with the premise of your opinion and topic being addressed, rather than assembling the facts and presenting a conclusion at the end.
DO: Be timely  We prefer letters about current events rather than something that happened months ago. Address issues covered by The Seattle Times in the past several weeks. Make sure a letter submission contains the most recent updates on a news topic.
DO: Include name and contact information  Include your full name (no initials), address and telephone number(s) for verification. Only your name and city of residence are published. We do not publish letters written anonymously or under pseudonyms.
DO: Cite sources and provide context  Please include URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your letter submission. This helps the editor fact-check letters.
DO: Submit a letter only to The Seattle Times  If your letter has been sent to another publication or published elsewhere in print, on a personal blog or on Facebook, we will not be able to use it.
DO: Submit as text   Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email or in an attached Microsoft Word document. Please do not send us files in PDF format.
DO: Keep letter submissions short  200 words or fewer.
DONT: Send a PR pitch or send a letter as part of a mailing campaign  Dont submit a letter related to your organizations event or as part of a mailing campaign. News tips should be sent to newstips@seattletimes.com.
DONT: Demand review of editing or headlines  Most editors are willing to discuss editing changes for brevity or clarity but are seldom patient with nitpicks. Titles on letters submitted are rarely used because of specific formatting requirements for print and digital publication. Headlines are written by someone who specializes in that skill.
DONT: Use specialized jargon  Use common English.
DONT: Follow-up contact  There's no need to call first to ask if we're interested. If we want to publish it, we'll contact you within five business days.
DONT: Demand a letter be removed once it is published  The Seattle Times does not remove content online once it has been published. If something needs correcting, please follow up with the letters editor.

How to submit an Op-EdThe Seattle Times welcomes submissions of guest commentaries. We receive more than a hundred unsolicited Op-Eds every week and have spots for only a few.
To be considered, a submission should have a strong opinion and be no longer than 650 words.
A guest column is for making arguments or comments on public policy or issues in the news. It is not a place for organizations or agencies merely to report on programs.
We give highest priority to local writers writing about local topics.
We require first-publication rights for print and online to all of our Op-Ed submissions. If your Op-Ed has been published elsewhere in print, on a personal blog or on Facebook, we will not be able to use it.
When we use a freelance article from you, you retain ownership of any copyright to the article and the right to resell it, subject to our right to edit, publish, republish and reproduce the article in publications and reprints of The Seattle Times Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes non-exclusive rights to use the article, in whole or in part, in electronic media, including searchable databases and electronic publications in any form and medium, which may include commercial database services where your work may be individually accessed.
Where to Send
Please send your submission by email: oped@seattletimes.com
If you do not hear from us within five business days, we likely will not be using your submission.
Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email or in an attached Microsoft Word document.
We do not publish Op-Eds written anonymously or under pseudonyms.
Please include a headshot of the author, minimum size 200 KB, and a biography of 30 words or fewer.
Please include Web URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your Op-Ed submission.
Writing guidelines: Do's and Don'ts for Op-ed Writers
DO have an opinion and state it forcefully. Many opinion pieces submitted are explanations of an issue rather than knowledgeable arguments about an issue.
DO be civil. It's perfectly appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks.
DO present the case from the top down. It's usually better to begin with the premise of your opinion rather than assembling the facts and presenting a conclusion at the end.
DO be timely. Editorial sections prefer articles about current events rather than something that happened last year.
DO be patient. We usually work at least a week in advance.
DON'T submit Op-Eds that are written by organizations and then shopped around for an author or authors. That's a petition, not an Op-Ed.
DON'T key the Op-Ed off an invented "public awareness" event, such as Intellectual Property Day or Public Hospital Week. Indeed there might be something valuable and newsworthy to say about issues related to those or other areas, but the Op-Ed will be judged on its authentic news value, not on a created awareness event.
DON'T demand review of editing or headlines. Most editors are willing to discuss editing changes for brevity or clarity but are seldom patient with nitpicks. Titles on articles submitted are rarely used. Headlines are written by someone who specializes in that skill.
DON'T submit the same piece to different publications at the same time. Editors hate to see a piece on their desk appear in another print or online publication. As a general rule, ride one horse at a time.
