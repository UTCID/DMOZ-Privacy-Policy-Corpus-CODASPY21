PRIVACY
QUESTION
I see adverts on some part
of the Dubroom and not on other parts.
What's the deal with that?
ANSWER
Quite simple:
in April 2014, the Dubroom
underwent a renovation which included the
removal of all advertisements from the
Dubroom. Should you be seeing an ad, refresh
the page in your browser.
QUESTION
Does this include the ads I
sometimes see on the Dubroom Message
Board?
ANSWER
No. The reason why one can
sometimes see ads there is because no one
has donated a little bit to make the forum
ad-free and the Dubroom webmaster does not
always have the money to do so.
QUESTION
Does the Dubroom keep track
on visitors?
ANSWER
Yes. We gather the amount of
unique visitors, how many pages they view,
and from which sites they come from. We do
not collect any personal information.
QUESTION
Does the Dubroom use
cookies?
ANSWER
Yes. Cookies are the general
way sites store information in your Internet
browser. You can turn them off, though. It
will not disable you from enjoying the
Dubroom to the fullness. Just go to the help
files of your browser and follow
instructions.
QUESTION
What exactly does the
Dubroom monitor?
ANSWER
The amount of visitors on
various Dubroom pages is monitored. Where
they come from, from which link did they
enter the Dubroom? These kind of things are
relevant for the Dubroom. For example, one
of the best visited places in the Dubroom is
the Studio. This gives an indication that
more work should be done there.  Also the I.P.
addresses for posters in the various fora
are known to the Dubroom.
QUESTION
Some people put me on a
mailing list after I've sent them e-mail.
Does the Dubroom also have this practice?
ANSWER
No.
QUESTION
What does the Dubroom do
with the many email adress they have?
ANSWER
Nothing. Only after you've
registered yourself to THE
DUBROOM MESSAGE BOARDS your address
will be stored in a database. And then the
adress will only be used to send you want
you wanted in the first place. The Dubroom
does not do anything other with any email
adress they might receive. We do not sell it
to third parties, we also keep it safely
away from third parties eyes.
QUESTION
What is being done with the
gathered statistical data?
ANSWER
Nothing really much.
Statistical data is being used to see which
parts of the Dubroom are the most popular,
it is also checked from which pages people
enter the Dubroom. All this information is
used to improve the services.
