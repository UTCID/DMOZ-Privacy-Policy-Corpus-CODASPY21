Alternative Use language sets forth mutually agreed upon guidance about WVIA's use of funds in unforeseen circumstances, while maintaining the donor’s general charitable purposes.Alternative Use Clause example #1:If unforeseen circumstances should alter or change WVIA’s ability to expend gift funds in accordance with the Donor’s intent, WVIA will consult with the Donor to redirect remaining Gift proceeds to areas most consistent with the Donor’s wishes. If WVIA is unable to reach Donor, or if Donor is no longer able to make such direction, then WVIA will make reasonable effort to consult with the Donor's heirs or assigns to provide for other use(s) for such Gift proceeds.Alternative Use Clause example #2:If, in the opinion of the President and CEO or the Executive Committee of the Board of WVIA, all or part of the gift funds cannot, in the future, be applied usefully to the above purposes, it may be used for any related purpose which, in the opinion of the President and CEO in consultation with the Executive Committee of the Board, will most nearly accomplish the wishes of the Donor as expressed herein.Home > About > Policies
