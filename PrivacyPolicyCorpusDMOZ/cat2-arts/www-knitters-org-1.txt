Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:

The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself only to complete your request or to distribute our newsletter, the Cable Gram, and other relevant information about the Minnesota Knitters’ Guild. We do not share this information with outside parties.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive and to distribute member information. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
