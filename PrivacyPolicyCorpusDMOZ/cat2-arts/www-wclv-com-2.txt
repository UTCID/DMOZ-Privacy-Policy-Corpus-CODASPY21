Children’s Privacy Policy
Access to Children
Our website is visited and accessible to children under the age of 13. Only after their parents’ consent will we request e-mail addresses or demographic information from children under 13.
ATTENTION TO ALL CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13:
IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU MUST GET PERMISSION FROM YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN BEFORE YOU:
* SEND ANY INFORMATION TO 90.3 WCPN ideastream ABOUT YOURSELF OR OTHERS OVER THE INTERNET, BY E-MAIL OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS; OR
* USE ANY INTERACTIVE FEATURE OF THIS WEBSITE.
PLEASE HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY WITH YOU BEFORE YOU CONTINUE ON OUR WEBSITE.
Personal Information
As you or your child navigate within our website, we may be collecting and tracking personal information, either by directly asking you or your child to tell us something about yourself (such as your name, address, e-mail address or birth date) or passively using data-tracking software that tells us what parts of our web site you have browsed.
Your child’s use of our website is not conditioned on your child’s disclosure of any more personal information than is reasonably necessary.
Personal information about you or your child may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication or by regular mail or telephone. This information will NOT be made available in any “chat” area.
We will also be collecting and tracking information about your or your child’s activities on our website in the aggregate (i.e., on a group basis), where we will not know or keep track of precisely who you and your child are. We do this to keep track of what users may be interested in, to help us in our marketing efforts. When we share this aggregate information with third parties, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you.
Contact our Website
For inquiries concerning our information practices, you may contact us by email, through our online e-mail form here, or by regular mail:
Idea Center®
1375 Euclid Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1835
We will employ reasonable methods to insure that we are communicating with the parent or legal guardian during this contact, and during any contact requiring verifiable parental consent.
Parent’s Rights to their Children’s Collected Information
As a parent or guardian, you have the right to the following:
* Review both the categories of information collected and the specific information collected about your child;
* Prevent further use of the information collected about your child;
* Prevent further collection of your child’s personal information; and
* Delete your child’s personal information.
Upon receipt of your request to do any of the above acts, we will verify that you are in fact the child’s parent or legal guardian. Please contact us to exercise this right.
Duty of Confidentiality
ideastream recognizes its duty to maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your child’s information. We employ such reasonable procedures in an effort to maintain confidentiality, security and interity.
Use of Personal Information
We do not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purposes whatsoever, from visitors to this website who are under 13 years of age without parental consent.
No information collected from visitors under the age of 13 to this website is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever without parental consent.
Parental Consent
I have read the preceding disclosure concerning collecting personal data from children and I consent to allow ideastream to collect and use personally identifiable information about me and my child, or the child for whom I am legally responsible, during any visit to the ideastream website. I acknowledge that my consent is necessary before ideastream can collect, use and/or disclose my child’s personal information.
Please provide your name and full street address so that we can mail you a consent form and a postage pre-paid envelope for you to send us your signed consent and verifiable proof of your status as your child’s parent or legal guardian for our files. All information you provide below will be held in ideastream’s records only to indicate that valid consent was given. Please do not allow your child to use our website until you have returned the written consent form to ideastream.
