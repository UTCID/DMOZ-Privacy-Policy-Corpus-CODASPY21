To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. While we strive to protect our user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. We will provide you reasonable access to personal information that you provided through the Website and the reasonable ability to review and correct it, as applicable. We may also collect non-personal information such as your IP address and use 'cookies' on the website.

We may collect data to verify the information you provide manually and to provide you with location-based content. We may associate Personally Identifiable Information with location-based information provided by you or your Personal Communication Device solely for our internal use and to improve your experience with the Services.
Site Visitorship Data
Site Visitorship Data is information about the way a website is used that is not associated with an individual’s identity. We use anonymous data regarding online behavior to better understand how people use our Services. To that end, we may use and disclose aggregated, anonymous online traffic behavior along with information from third parties to track usage trends and thereby improve the Services. We may also use and disclose this aggregated, anonymous information to develop reports that we may share with third party marketing partners and affiliates. The kind of information we may collect includes:
• the date and time you access the Services;
• your internet service provider, mobile carrier, or data services provider;
• your Internet Protocol (IP) address;
• the pages you visit;
• the products you purchase and review;
• the links you click;
• the features used;
• how and when you interact with the Services;
• the content, images and advertisements you select; and
• how you arrived at the Services and where you go when you leave.
Most Site Visitorship Data is collected using data collection tools such as web beacons, cookies, embedded web links and other software (together, “Data Collection Tools”).  Data Collection Tools are typically small data files or software that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer's or mobile device's hard drive. Most browsers and display software can be set to inform you when Data Collection Tools are being used or other tracking software is being sent to your computer or Personal Communication Device. They also provide you with the option of refusing such Data Collection Tools. However, refusing to allow the use of Data Collection Tools may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, certain areas or features of the Services, including preventing you from purchasing products or services.
Data Collection Tools may store the information in your shopping cart and allow us to relate your use of the Services to other information about you, including your Personal Information. We may do this to improve and personalize your experience with the Services and help resolve problems you experience through your use of the Services.
We use Site Visitorship Data to develop, manage, and improve the Website. Sometimes we may aggregate Site Visitorship Data with personal information from registered members. We may use that information to:
• manage the Website;
• help resolve problems;
• analyze use of the site; and
• tell you about products or services that our third party marketing partners, members and we may offer.
Disclosure of Information
Administrator will not release any personal information to third parties without your consent except as follows:
(1) Anyone providing us their personally identifiable information grants us and our affiliates the right to use their information for the provision of Services to you and for the benefit of Administrator without restrictions for the purposes that include, without limitation, research, marketing, and content and lead development.  Administrator does not collect or disclose personally identifiable information that is unrelated to these purposes.  And if we wish to disclose personally identifiable information we have collected for purposes other than those stated in this Privacy Policy, we will ask for your consent to do so.
(2) Administrator may share information we collect with our business and third party marketing partners.

• to vendors who provide us with service; or
• to companies that may acquire part or all of Administrator or an affiliated company.
Administrator is not responsible for the protection of the information you provide to other websites. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on other websites, such information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications.
Advertising
We may use third-party companies to serve ads and provide content through the Services. These companies may use cookies and other Data Collection Tools that are not sent by us to learn about your use of the Services and other websites and apps in order to present personalized advertisements and other messages that may be of interest to you. Administrator is not responsible for such cookies and tracking software.
Commercial Transactions
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other reasons, we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our business. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers or joint venture partners, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
Information Security
Whenever you enter an area of the site that carries or requires you to enter sensitive information such as your credit card details, a padlock icon will appear in the address bar of your browser, indicating that the page is secure. Administrator uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Private Communications Technology security standards that are supported by popular browsers. SSL encodes your personal information by encrypting credit card number, name, address, phone number, identification number and your password so that they cannot be read by unauthorized parties. While we may provide encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not guarantee that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception or error.
We have put in place certain physical, technological and managerial procedures to safeguard the personally identifiable information we collect. However, these procedures do not guarantee that the information will remain secure against theft or misuse.
Communications
From time to time, Administrator may communicate with you regarding your transactions and the administration of your account, current projects, special offers, invitations to events, offers for services, product testing opportunities, updates to the Services, press releases, announcements concerning new services we provide, contests and sweepstakes, as well as important changes in our and this Privacy Policy. By providing us with your e-mail address and/or your mobile phone number, you consent to receiving such communications. If at any time you decide for any reason that you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may “opt out” of receiving them by using one of the following methods:
• Select the "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions that may be included in such communication.
• Where applicable, return to the web page(s) or service where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions.
• E-mail us at mail@joejackson.com.  Be sure to provide your name, e-mail address and postal address, and specific relevant information about the particular service you no longer wish to receive.
Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from us where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving such services. By registering as a user or purchasing products, you consent to receiving administration and transaction related communications.

Any "share" feature available as part of the Services will redirect you to a third party website or Widget, wherein the third party website's privacy policy will apply.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
