Reese's nuanced performance makes a predictable story about a dumb yet not so-dumb blonde rock.

So predictable, so ridiculous, offensively so. A couple of wisecracks aside and the short nature of the film saves it from a worse score. If I were to stoop to the same lazy tropes as this film, I'd describe it as very blonde.

Since this movie is now on Netflix, I suggest you watch this movie if you are a fan of mean girls And if you are looking for a movie that will make you completely shocked after.

I like fluffy movies (my favorite of all time is a cartoon, in fact) but this is too much. All fluff, no substance. I don't understand why critics (or viewers) are so into this. It's sexist, shallow, and plays on stereotypes all over the place. And it's honestly not even remotely funny. It's formulaic and bland. I just don't get the draw. It's like the whole world decided at once to give this movie a pardon.
Also, the ‘bend and snap' is straight up ridiculous.
Seriously. If you want a movie about a shallow, lovable blonde, watch Clueless.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. While a bit predictable, it is also relaxing, fun and very entertaining. Starting out as a spoiled rich girl only interested in fashion and her boyfriend, Elle Woods steps out of her comfort zone and attends Harvard Law. Brilliant and charming, this girl brings the two world together and finds herself.
Reese Witherspoons amazing acting brings the whole thing together and her accentuated facial expressions make the movie all the more entertaining. Typical female stereotypes are attack, the stupidity of some men revealed and the kindness of others accentuated.
All in all a great movie!
