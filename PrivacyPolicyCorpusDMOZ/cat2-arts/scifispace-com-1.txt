Who we are
We are an independent science fiction community and news website (located at https://www.Scifispace.com) not associated with any network, studio or streaming service (no, we are not part of SyFy Channel).
What personal data we collect and why we collect it
Comments & Forum Posts
When visitors leave comments or posts/replies on the forums on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
You may opt-in to also publish your comment on Facebook. Facebook comments are subject to Facebook’s privacy policy published at https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website. Please be certain to give attribution to any photos or video you upload including the original source.
Contact forms
Information collected via contact forms is for our internal use only for the purpose stated on the form. We do not sell or rent any information such as name or email address.
Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Analytics
Who we share your data with
All analytical data collected is for internal use only. We do not collect or store specific information such as your name or email address. We may share visitor counts including by country or city location for the purpose of selling advertising to support our site, but no specific user information is shared.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. If you choose to share a comment on Facebook, it is subject to their Privacy Information published here https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation
No other data is sold, rented or sent to any 3rd party.
Your contact information
Any contact information you share with use including your name, email or physical address, phone number, ip address etc, is for our internal use only to contact you, allow you to contribute articles and media to the site, ship prizes or material for review, etc. We never sell, rent or share this information with anyone for any reason.
