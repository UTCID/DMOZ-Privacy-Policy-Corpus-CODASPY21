Privacy Policy
This Statement describes the types of information TVO collects, how it is used and to whom it is disclosed. The collection and use of personal information can be different for TVO's users of TVOKids.com and ILC content and websites.  Those sites have their own Privacy Policies.Collection and Use of Personal InformationTVO generally does not exclude anyone from a TVO website solely for not giving us personal information. We do ask for personal information in some situations to facilitate participation in certain programs or activities like contests and digital products.  For example, the MPower math suite of games. When we do ask for personal information (like a name andn e-mail address), it is only used for that particular activity unless expressly stated otherwise.  In some instances, where expressly noted, TVO may retain certain personal information (such as first and last name, and email address) after the particular activity in order to communicate in the future regarding TVO programming, products and philanthropic efforts.  The TVO servers may retain some of this information, but we will not share this personal information with a third party unless we explicitly state otherwise or unless required by law. For the sole purpose of the MPower math suite of games a student's teacher shall not be considered a third party if the student's account is registered under that teacher.  Any information that is collected will only be used for the purposes for which it was collected.Personally identifiable information may include:Name, address, gender, school and grade from STUDENTS REGISTERING TO USE THE ASK A TEACHER SERVICE. This allows us to track use and popularity of the service, make improvements to the site, and withhold privileges, where warranted.Name, school-board issued email addresses, school, and grade from AUTHORIZED TEACHERS REGISTERING THEIR STUDENTS TO USE THE MPOWER math suite of games. This allows us to verify teacher accounts, to track use and popularity of the games, and make improvements to the games.Name, teacher, school, and grade from STUDENTS REGISTERING TO USE THE MPOWER math suite of games. Information about a student's usage including results and levels of completion in the MPOWER math suite of games is accessible to TVO and to a student's teacher if a STUDENT IS REGISTERED UNDER THAT TEACHER FOR THE MPOWER math suite of games. For the sole purpose of the MPower math suite of games a student's teacher will not be considered a third party if the student's account is registered under that teacher. Information about student usage may also be collected and compiled together into reports; all such information in the reports shall be anonymized so individual students cannot be identified. This allows us to track use and popularity of the games, make improvements to the games, and helps a student's teacher evaluate that student's progress.Name, address, age and, if necessary to process payments, banking information from STUDENTS REGISTERING TO TAKE COURSES OFFERED THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT LEARNING CENTRE (the "ILC"). This helps us meet the legal requirements imposed on educational institutions, and supervise and grade correspondence courses.E-mail addresses and possibly, names, addresses and telephone numbers of TELEVISION VIEWERS OR WEB SITE VISITORS WISHING TO CONTACT TVO THROUGH ONE OF OUR FEEDBACK LOOPS. The nature of these queries, absent any personally identifying information, may serve as an informal content assessment tool and be summarized and circulated within the organization.E-mail addresses for TELEVISION VIEWERS OR WEB SITE VISITORS WISHING TO RECEIVE ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATIONS OF UPCOMING PROGRAMS OR PROGRAM TOPICS. This enables TVO to communicate by e-mail with viewers or website visitors about upcoming programs or program topics.Names, addresses (including e-mail address), telephone numbers and possibly, ages, of PARTICIPANTS OF SURVEYS conducted by or on behalf TVO.

Donor information excluding financial information may also be traded with other charities and non-profit organizations, provided the donor does not object. Donors are given a number of opportunities to withhold consent through direct mailings or via e-mail at the time their donation is confirmed and via other solicitations they are sent throughout the year, including at renewal time.Names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and other information, from JOB APPLICANTS as provided to TVO when a job applicant applies for a job with TVO by: (i) by sending TVO a cover letter and/or resume; or (ii) by submitting a job application through a third party website. Resumes and job applications are forwarded to TVO's Human Resources department for evaluation or for consideration, as the case may be, for available positions with TVO.Names, email addresses and other collected information collected by TVO in respect of any of these purposes may on notice be retained beyond the particular purpose, in order to communicate in the future regarding TVO programming, products and philanthropic efforts.Personal e-mail address and telephone numbers will not be disclosed to or shared with third-parties, unless TVO expressly makes this known at the time of request.ConsentAny communications from TVO shall only be sent with the implied or express consent of the recipient, unless the communication is exempted under Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, and shall contain an opt-out provision whereby the recipients may request that TVO cease all such further communications to them.Consent may be sought by: a signed and returned consent form (scanned and emailed); a call on a toll free number; email correspondence along with confirmatory steps to be taken by the recipient.Parental consent may be sought by: a consent form to be signed and returned by the parent/guardian (scanned and emailed); parent/guardian to call a toll free number; email correspondence with parent/guardian and confirmatory steps to be taken by the parent/guardian.A user can enter a TVO online CONTEST through any TVO website.
