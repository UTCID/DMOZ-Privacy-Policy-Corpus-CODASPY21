The Smurfs Time Travel season
Overview of The Smurfs and the television show.
In 1981, NBC President Fred Silverman bought the rights to the Flemish Smurfs characters and turned them into one of the most successful cartoons ever to hit the air. Created by cartoonist Peyo Culliford in 1957, the Smurfs (known as Les Schtroumpfs in their homeland) became famous in America through the popular line of Wallace Berrie toys and figurines. Silverman extended the brand to television - and created the beloved show we know today.
Smurfs are blue and three-apples tall. There are over 100 Smurfs and they live in mushroom houses inside the Smurf Village. The Smurfs are led by 543-year-old Papa Smurf, a good and powerful wizard. Each Smurf is assigned a task in the village, according to their ability and the needs of the community. Smurfs live peaceful lives in harmony with nature. However, the Smurfs also face a horrible enemy - their nemesis Gargamel. The evil Gargamel is a wizard who spends his days trying to capture, eat, or destroy the Smurfs. Gargamel's cat Azrael adds to the menace, always looking for a tasty blue snack. There are sundry other bad-guys who like to make the Smurfs' lives difficult as well.
Each Smurf possesses one dominant emotion or characteristic, which is reflected by his or her name. Characters on the show include Brainy, Jokey, Vanity, Grouchy and Clumsy. Later seasons of the program feature new characters, such as Grandpa Smurf and the four Smurflings (Nat, Snappy, Slouchy, and the female Sassette). Gargamel, too, gets a sidekick in the form of his apprentice, Scruple.
In 1982 the Culliford characters Johan and his aide Peewit (re-christened "Peewee" in America) were given their own segments during an expanded, 90-minute version of the Smurfs. The two humans proved to be unpopular and were eventually dropped.
Despite its incredible popularity, The Smurfs did encounter some controversy. Some adults considered the show discriminatory in its portrayal of Smurfette, the female Smurf. In addition, there were some serious (and not so serious) comparisons made between Communism (feared at the time) and the Smurf lifestyle.
Perhaps the most memorable feature of the show is the use of the word "smurf" in every possible tense and construction. It wouldn't be unusual to hear a Smurf remark, "It's such a smurfy day, I think I'll go smurfing in the River Smurf."
In terms of accolades and milestones, the show won two Emmys for Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series and, in 1987, NBC produced a "message" episode. The "message" episode, "Lure Of The Orb", features anti-drug themes. In the show, Poet, Handy, and Painter Smurf become addicts after rubbing a witch's magic orb, requiring the help of Papa Smurf and the gang to overcome their problem.
The Smurfs hit the silver screen in 1984 with "The Smurfs and the Magic Flute". The film is actually a dubbed version of an older Belgian Schtroumpfs feature, and the Smurfs don't actually appear on-screen until later in the film. The film was a failure, but the television show continued to rule Saturday mornings for the better part of the decade.
In 1989, in an attempt to revive the nearly decade-old show, the Smurfs leave the Smurf Village and visit various times and locations throughout history. This substantial change to the Smurfs television formula proved too much for audiences to accept. Viewership of the show fell. After the time-travel season, the show was canceled. The cartoon survives to this day in a syndicated package called The Smurfs' Adventures.
The show ran from 9/12/81 to 8/25/90 on the NBC television network. The cartoon was produced by Hanna-Barbera, NBC, SEPP Intl. S.A., and Wang Company Ltd.

Where and when can I watch The Smurfs on TV?
The Smurfs are shown on both Cartoon Network and Boomerang!
Cartoon Network is a worldwide cartoon channel that features the most popular (and best) cartoons available on television. Boomerang is a television network which features classic cartoons from 1958 through the 1990s. If Cartoon Network or Boomerang are not available on your local cable system, you can receive it via Dish Network or DirecTV throughout North America. Dish Network and DirectTV also provide online program guides that detail exactly when and where the next episode of the Smurfs will be shown.
Cartoon Network and Boomerang do not always begin showing the Smurfs at exactly the stated time - sometimes the show begins a few minutes early, and sometimes it begins a few minutes late. So make sure you show up early!
