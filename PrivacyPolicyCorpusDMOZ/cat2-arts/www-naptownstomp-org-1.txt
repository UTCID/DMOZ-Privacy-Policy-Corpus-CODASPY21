Naptown Stomp does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies except when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if Naptown Stomp, Inc. is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Naptown Stomp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Children’s Privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware that this Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not specifically collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13. If Naptown Stomp learns it has collected information through the Internet from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents’ permission before using the Naptown Stomp Site or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
