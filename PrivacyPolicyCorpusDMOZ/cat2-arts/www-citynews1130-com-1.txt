Important note regarding comments on citynews1130.com:
Dear reader,
We truly appreciate you visiting citynews1130.com. We aim to provide you with the most up to date and need to know information to help you navigate this complicated world.
On December 11, 2019, we’re making a change to the website by closing all comments on stories.
This will allow our digital team more time to focus on writing stories that matter to you. Unfortunately, some of the comments are not being made in the spirit of discourse.
Although the comments are being closed on www.citynews1130.com, you are able to share your opinion on our stories anytime on a number of platforms:
