OF WARRANTY; LIABILITY LIMITATION
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
AND AGREE TO THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION THAT THE CONTENT AND SITE ARE PROVIDED
"AS IS" AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
MEGATRAX, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AGENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS (THE
“MEGATRAX PARTIES”) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS,
AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NONINFRINGEMENT,
AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION, AS THEY MAY
APPLY. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT THE MEGATRAX PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT AND THE SITE WILL BE
WITHOUT ERRORS, VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. THE MEGATRAX PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT OR
OTHERWISE STATE THAT THE CONTENT AND THE SITE AND/OR THE CONTENT WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS. YOU, AND NOT THE MEGATRAX
PARTIES, ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION OCCASIONED BY USE OF THE CONTENT AND THE SITE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
TO THE EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MEGATRAX PARTIES BE LIABLE
FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE, EVEN IF WE
WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF,

LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MEGATRAX PARTIES’ TOTAL
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY) EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE
APPLICABLE LICENSE.
12. BINDING
ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
You and Megatrax
agree to binding arbitration of any and all disputes between you and the
Megatrax Parties, except for disputes relating to the enforcement of the
intellectual property rights of the Megatrax Parties. "Dispute" includes any dispute,
action or other controversy between you and Megatrax concerning the Site, the
Content provided on the Site and/ or these Terms and Conditions, whether in
contract, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or other legal or equitable
basis. You and Megatrax empower the
arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of
these Terms and Conditions, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any
claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions are void or voidable.
In the event of a
dispute, you or Megatrax must send to the other party a notice of dispute,
which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact
information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the
dispute and the relief requested. You
must send any notice of dispute to 7629 Fulton Avenue, North Hollywood, California
91605. We will send any notice of
dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and Megatrax will attempt to resolve a
dispute through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date the
notice of dispute is sent. After thirty
(30) days, you or we may commence such arbitration.
If you and Megatrax
do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation, the dispute shall be settled
by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final,
except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE IN THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A
JUDGE OR JURY. Arbitration will be
administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA")
under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer Related Disputes. For more
information, visit www.adr.org or, in the United States, call 800-778-7879. Arbitration may be conducted in person,
through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you
individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but
only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
PROCEEDINGS TO
RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL
BASIS. Neither you nor the Megatrax
Parties will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney
general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes
to act in a representative capacity. No
arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior
written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. If the class action waiver is found to be
illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will
be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding
in binding arbitration.
13. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Terms and Conditions
shall be held void, voidable, invalid or inoperative, no other provision of these
Terms and Conditions shall be affected as a result thereof and, accordingly,
the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall remain in full
force and effect as though such void, voidable, invalid or inoperative
provision has not been contained herein.
14. WAIVER
No modification, amendment, waiver,
termination or discharge of these Terms and Conditions or provisions hereof
shall be binding upon Megatrax, unless confirmed by a written instrument and signed
by Megatrax. No waiver by Megatrax of
any of these Terms and Conditions or provisions hereof or of any default
hereunder shall affect the respective rights of Megatrax thereafter to enforce
such term or provision or to exercise any right or remedy in the event of any
other default, whether or not similar.
15. CHOICE OF LAW
This Agreement has been entered into
in the State of California, and its validity, construction, interpretation and
legal effect shall be governed solely by and under the laws of the State of
California, applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within
the State of California. You hereby
consent, shall be subject to and shall submit to the jurisdiction of the Federal
and state courts located in the County of Los Angeles, State of California,
which courts shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction thereof. You hereby waive any and all other
jurisdiction, without limitation.
16. SURVIVAL
The provisions of these Terms and
Conditions which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms
and Conditions shall survive such termination.
