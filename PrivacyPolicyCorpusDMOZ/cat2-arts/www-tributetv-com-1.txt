information such as your name and email address. We collect this information to identify who you are and to facilitate your participation in our forums.
Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forums becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is
important for you to carefully consider what, if any, personal information you reveal in these areas.
