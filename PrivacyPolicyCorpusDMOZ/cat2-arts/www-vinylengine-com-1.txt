Spamming of the site will also result in a permanent ban on the spammed company/URL - spam this site and you will never get another link/recommendation on this site, regardless of it's relevance or who posts it, it will be removed. Please note that as the Vinyl Engine has no control of the content of external web pages, and to prevent spam, all external links are appended with the 'nofollow' tag and will not improve SEO.

The forum has a low level of moderation so we ask members to respect the site policy.

v. Whining Posts: This website and it's services are provided free if charge. You are not a customer, you are a guest and are expected to behave as such. If you make a public post
here or elsewhere critising this website or it's members it will be considered a resignation of your account and any attempt to register a new account will be treated as abuse and dealt with accordingly.
w. Thread Hijacking. Starting a forum thread does not constitute ownership and during a discussion subject matter may naturally drift off topic over time - if you feel a thread would benefit from being split please contact the webmaster to suggest this - do not attack other posters to the thread.
x. Disruptive Behaviour. Members who make aggressively worded or confrontational posts, who appear to have an agenda against a manufacturer/person website etc, or who are felt to have a disruptive effect on the forum, may be suspended/banned from the site at the moderators discretion.
Special posting rules for trade members
For the purposes of these rules, Trade Members include anyone involved in the Music/HiFi industry eg manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, commercial partners, affiliates etc, and their friends and family members.
Trade Members are welcome to participate in the forum but only in a private capacity. Self-promotion or advertising in any form is strictly prohibited and the following rules have been devised to preserve the non-commercial nature of the forum.
Forum Posts
Trade Members must not start new threads relating to their business interests, directly or indirectly. They should also avoid any involvement in discussions about products/services in which they have a financial interest. The forum is not intended to be a replacement for official product support and/or a promotional tool.
Trade Members have a limited 'right to reply' where products/services in which they have a financial interest are discussed in the main forum, but they should not intervene in critical evaluations of their products by other members except to correct factual errors. Any such response should be short, to the point and made in a single post. It must not contain any criticism of other members/posts.
Trade Members must not offer a service/product in response to a general query (eg what turntable should I buy?)
Trade Members must not comment on the design/efficacy of services/products provided by other traders where there is a conflict of interest eg sellers of turntable X should not make critical statements about turntable Y where the two products are in competition.
Signatures and Avatars
Trade Members are not permitted to have text, images, videos, addresses, taglines or website links in their posts or signatures as these are considered an advertisement or promotion of a commercial site. All such content will be considered spam and removed.
Links
Trade members must not include links to their websites or address/telephone number etc in any comment, post, signature, personal message etc, or give incentives to any other member to provide such a link.
Interpretation and application of these rules is at the discretion of the forum moderator. All decisions are final.
Deleted/Moved Posts or Closed Threads
Sometimes posts are deleted/moved or threads closed. Certainly posts that break any of the above rules will be deleted or moved, but often posts that are in full compliance with the rules are also deleted. This includes double posts and posts that are perceived by the forum moderators to be in the wrong forum section. The primary reasons are twofold: one, the amount of disk space consumed by the forum is always a concern, so sometimes posts are deleted to conserve space; two, because forum posts are archived for future perusal, posts that are not of enduring and somewhat broad interest may be culled at our discretion. Note, by the way, that message deletions are never personal; it's just the way the system works. If a post of yours gets deleted/moved or a thread closed, don't post about it. Inexplicably, the realization that posts have been deleted/moved or thread closed prompts some to post to the forum asking why. These posts are most definitely not of enduring interest for future perusal by general audiences. Therefore, they will be deleted and the member may be suspended indefinitely from further posting at our discretion. In any case, it does not make sense to post such questions to the forum anyway. The readers of the forum do not delete posts the forum admin does. If a post gets deleted, the best you'll get from anybody else about why is speculation. If you want to ask about why a post was deleted, contact the webmaster rather than posting the question to everybody. Note, however, that most of the time you won't get any more detailed an answer than the explanation in the previous bullet item as usually there isn't more of an explanation than that. In any case deleted posts are irrecoverable.
Private Messaging
The private messaging system is a feature which allows registered members to have uninterrupted conversations outside of the main forum arena. It is not a secure messaging system and shouldn't be used to exchange important information such as bank details etc. Use of the private messaging system to criticise other members, the site moderation or the site in general is not permitted and may result in your account being restricted or closed.
It should also be noted that the administration of the site has full access to the text of such messages and should any member be suspected of being in violation of forum rules their messages may be reviewed as part of any ongoing investigation into their conduct. Messages may be deleted/republished in whole or in part where the moderators of the forum feel it is the general interest. This includes messages from 3rd parties where applicable. The general rule is, do not post anything in a PM that you would not post in the general forum.
Note that use of the PM system for commercial solicitation or sale of goods or services to members is expressly prohibited.
Registration forms
In our registration forms, Vinyl Engine may ask you for personal identifying information, such as your name & e-mail address for internal record-keeping, discount schemes and database purposes.
