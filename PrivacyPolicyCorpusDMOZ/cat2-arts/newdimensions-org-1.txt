Privacy Policy:
New Dimensions Radio ("New Dimensions Radio")
operates newdimensions.org and may operate other websites. It
is New Dimensions Radio's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, New Dimensions Radio collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. New Dimensions Radio's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how New Dimensions Radio's visitors use its website. From time to
time, New Dimensions Radio may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
New Dimensions Radio also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on newdimensions.org
blogs/sites. New Dimensions Radio only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to New Dimensions Radio's websites choose to interact
with New Dimensions Radio in ways that require New Dimensions Radio to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that New Dimensions Radio gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at newdimensions.org to provide a
username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with New Dimensions Radio are asked to
provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, New Dimensions Radio collects such information only insofar as
is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
New Dimensions Radio. New Dimensions Radio does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
New Dimensions Radio may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. New Dimensions Radio may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, New Dimensions Radio does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
New Dimensions Radio discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on New Dimensions Radio's behalf or to provide services available
at New Dimensions Radio's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using New Dimensions Radio's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
them. New Dimensions Radio will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, New Dimensions Radio discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when New Dimensions Radio believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of New Dimensions Radio, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
user of an New Dimensions Radio website and have supplied your email address, New Dimensions Radio
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what's going on with New Dimensions Radio and our products. If you send us a request (for
example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. New Dimensions Radio takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
