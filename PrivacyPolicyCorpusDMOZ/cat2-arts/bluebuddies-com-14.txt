Questions and Answers:
Why was BlueBuddies.com created?
We love the Smurfs. A lot. The creators of this site have collected Smurfs for years - and we talk endlessly about our little blue buddies with anyone that will listen. We decided to put our money where our mouth was and create a Smurfs website - but not just any website, mind you - something special...We started in 1995, carefully entering our Smurf collection into an Amiga computer system. We knew that a computerized database just had to be started...we just didn't know how far it would take us - or that it would grow so large!In 1998, there was only one dedicated Smurfs web domain in existence (which is sadly no longer with us). Although we loved that site, it seemed an impossible task for a single website run by a single person to catalog and sell all the great smurfy items in the world - so we decided to do our part. We created a complimentary site dedicated to cataloging every Smurf product we could find, starting with our own computerized database that we'd been building for years. We decided to maintain a non-profit status to help concentrate on the Herculean task of archiving as opposed to selling.Over time, we've created the largest compendium of Smurf material available anywhere. Compiling and showcasing these items is our passion. We love sharing our smurfy finds with the whole world. We love talking about them with the Smurfs community (see our Smurfy Bulletin Board System). We love the fact that although other websites may come and go, BlueBuddies.com stands as a cornerstone for Smurfs fans everywhere. BlueBuddies.com was born in 1995 and continues to thrive to this day as the oldest dedicated Smurf domain on the web, a fact we're fiercely proud of. We are resolute in our dedication to the Smurfs community - our passion for Smurfs is infectious! Long live the Smurfs!

What is the mission of BlueBuddies.com?
We are dedicated, as a non-profit resource for the Smurf community, to organize and catalog every piece of Smurf merchandise in existence. BlueBuddies.com is a non-profit educational resource maintained by the worldwide Smurf community.
There are a lot of items I'd like to buy from you but there is no "Purchase" button. Why?
Foremost, this website is a gallery. BlueBuddies.com is an "archive" and "encyclopedia" of smurfiness. Items in the gallery that do not have a "Purchase" button are present for reference purposes only.
Has BlueBuddies.com won any accolades?Yes! We have been positively reviewed by Hotrate. In addition, we've also been mentioned in USA Today and Fark. We appreciate the support!
When I click SMURFS AUCTION I get taken to another website. Why?
BlueBuddies.com provides direct links to thousands of eBay's live Smurf auctions. Feel free to view or participate in any of these smurfy auctions! These auctions are not actually part of the BlueBuddies.com site, however. Clicking the auction link will take you directly to eBay's Smurf auctions.
What is the history of BlueBuddies.com?
BlueBuddies.com began as a project to computerize our Smurf collection on an Amiga computer in 1995. The website version of this Amiga compendium was launched on October 18, 1998 as "Papa Smurf's Sleepy Time Storybook and Secret Hideaway" using our (then) ISP as our webhost. On July 4, 1999 the domain PapaSmurf.org was created. Twenty days later, on July 24, 1999, a more modern incarnation of the site was opened to the public. On August 19, 2002 at 7:00 PM Central, PapaSmurf.org transferred its content into a custom designed scalable database-driven website engine. PapaSmurf.org and SmurfBBS.com were integrated into one seamless website on Friday, March 14, 2003 under the moniker BlueBuddies.com. We're connected to the internet via DS-3 fiber optic cable.
Who administers BlueBuddies.com?
Along with a host of other volunteers, BlueBuddies.com is managed by Papa Smurf, Raven Child and Sassette.
What security measures does BlueBuddies.com take to protect sensitive data?
