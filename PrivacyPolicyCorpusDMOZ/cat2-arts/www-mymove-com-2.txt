16. General Terms
The Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and the Company regarding the Site and Services, and the Terms of Use supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and the Company regarding the Site and Services.
You may not assign or transfer the Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms of Use, without such consent, will be null. Company may freely assign or transfer the Terms of Use without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms of Use will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications we may provide under the Terms of Use, including those regarding modifications to the Terms of Use, can be given: (a) via email; or (b) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

Except as expressly set forth in the Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Terms of Use or otherwise.
You expressly authorize us to comply with any and all lawful notices, subpoenas, court orders or warrants without prior notice to you.
To the extent that anything in, or associated with, the Site or Services is in conflict or inconsistent with the Terms of Use, the Terms of Use shall take precedence.
17. Legal Disputes
You and we agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the Terms of Use, your use of or access to the Services will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section (“Legal Disputes”). Please read this section (“Legal Disputes”) carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.
Arbitration/Class Waiver/Opt-Out Clauses
You and we each agree to resolve exclusively through final and binding arbitration any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us (including any affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents), whether or not such dispute or claim involves a third party, relating in any way to any aspect of our relationship or any contact between us, direct or indirect, or arising out of this or previous versions of the Terms of Use, your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services (“Dispute”).
You and we agree to submit the Dispute to a single arbitrator under the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including when applicable the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Consumer Arbitration Rules, or, by separate mutual agreement, at another arbitration institution. The AAA’s rules, information regarding initiating a claim, and a description of the arbitration process are available at adr.org.
The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA rules. As an alternative, you or we may bring a claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this section (“Legal Disputes”) regarding our agreement to arbitrate any Dispute (“Agreement to Arbitrate”), and the arbitrability of the Dispute. The arbitrator will decide whether the Dispute can be arbitrated.
You and we agree that each of us may bring a Dispute against the other only on our own behalf, and not on behalf of a government official or other person or entity, or a class of persons or entities. You and we agree, if we are a party to the proceeding, not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, a claim brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or a consolidated claim involving another person’s use of the site or our services. You and we agree not to combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under the Terms of Use with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under the Terms of Use. You and we agree to waive the right to a trial by jury for all disputes.
You may opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing, within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, either by U.S. mail delivered to: 1101 Red Ventures Drive, Attn: MYMOVE Legal Department, Fort Mill, SC 29707. You must include: (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained in paragraph (c) above is found to be unenforceable, then all of paragraphs (a)-(f) of this section (“Legal Disputes”) will be null and void as to that Dispute.
This Agreement to Arbitrate will survive the termination of your relationship with us.
Unless you and we agree otherwise, if you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, if the Agreement to Arbitrate is found by a court to be unenforceable, if your claim is not covered by the Agreement to Arbitrate, or if you neither are a resident of nor have a principal place of business in the US or Canada, you agree that any Dispute that has arisen, or may arise, between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. You and we agree to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of such courts for all purposes in connection with this Agreement to Arbitrate.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms of Use to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make a change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the notice address or the site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to a claim that was filed in a legal proceeding between you and us prior to the effective date of the change. The change shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen, or may arise, between you and us. We will notify you of a change to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on our Services at least 30 days before the effective date of the change and/or by email.
