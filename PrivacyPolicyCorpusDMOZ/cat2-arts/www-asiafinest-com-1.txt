AsiaFinest.com's Privacy Statement
AsiaFinest.com is a subsidiary of MadCool Network LLC.
MadCool Network LLC has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.AsiaFinest.com.
MadCool Network LLC occasionally will offer links to other sites. Please
know that when you enter these other sites (using links on AsiaFinest.com's
site) you are entering a site for which AsiaFinest.com has no responsibility.
These links are provided in order to better round out your entertainment
experience. However, we can not guarantee the same level of confidence
at these sites. Please contact the web administrator of the individual
third party sites if you have any comments or concerns.
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail,
information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or
site registrations.
The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded,
used to improve the content of our Web page, used to notify consumers
about updates to our Web site,and not shared with other organizations
for commercial purposes.
With respect to cookies: We set cookies only for use with poll on our
main page.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including
your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits
to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods
and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about
this practice and to know your choices about not having this information

Third Party Cookies
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party
advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your
browser.
When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator®
or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information
to MadCool Network LLC every time you access content on one of our sites.
Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were
just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol)
address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are
using to access our site. All of this information is collected by MadCool
Network LLC and is used to help improve our offerings to you. For instance,
from this information we determined that very few of our customers use
older browser versions. Because of this we recently decided to enhance
the quality of content available to all of our customers by using the
advanced features of HTML that cannot be accessed from those older browser
versions. All of the information that is automatically submitted to us
by your browser is considered Anonymous Information.
Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information
about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through
the use of cookies. Due to the way the Internet technically operates,
we cannot control this collection of information - but we can control
which companies are allowed to place such advertising on our site. If
you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of
this site, or your dealings with this web site, you can contact
us.
