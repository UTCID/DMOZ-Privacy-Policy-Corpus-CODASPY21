These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, sign up or buy tickets for events, or make online donations.•    Information CAE gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to user needs. Under no circumstances does CAE divulge any information about an individual user to a third party unless required by law.Optional Voluntary InformationWe offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:1. Electronic newsletter policyCAE gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page.2. Online donations and ticket purchasingCAE offers online donation functionality to our users through our service provider Neon.

CAE will never share any information about specific individuals gathered through the online donation function, online ticketing processing, or online event sign-up process with any third party unless required by law.ChildrenConsistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.Usage trackingCAE tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. CAE sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.CookiesWe may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. CAE uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.Use of informationCAE uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to sign up for events. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out updates when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. CAE never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don’t track which terms a particular user enters.Sharing of the informationCAE uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and improve service. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.SecurityCAE’s webhosting provider squarespace.com uses secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
