Listen LiveWatch LiveTelevisionRadioDonateThe trust of CPBN’s members, donors, and of the public at large is a high priority for CPBN, and our policy on use of membership and donor lists reflects the belief that we are a public service accountable to the public.CPBN will not sell its donor lists at any time, and will exchange them only with non-profit groups under the stipulations outlined below. At no time and under no circumstances will CPBN trade, sell, exchange or otherwise make its membership lists available to political parties, campaigns or political action groups, nor will CPBN buy or otherwise secure lists from such groups.Members and donors of CPBN will be regularly informed of their right to remove their name from lists to be exchanged and such requests will be promptly honored.CPBN will control the exchange of any lists by dealing directly with the non-profit organization or by securing the written agreement of any third-party broker to adhere to CPBN’S policy on this matter.Lists may be exchanged for a one-time use only and may not be used for any other purpose, including telemarketing (phone solicitation). Neither telephone numbers nor e-mail addresses will be included in exchanges.  No information will be shared about members’ giving history.CPBN has shared names for one-time use with a limited number of non-profit organizations. Such list exchanges are standard fundraising practices and reduce the cost of enrolling new members.If you are a member and wish to eliminate your name from such exchanges, or if you have any questions, feel free to contact CPBN Audience Care at (860 275-7550 or by emailing AudienceCare@ctpublic.org.
