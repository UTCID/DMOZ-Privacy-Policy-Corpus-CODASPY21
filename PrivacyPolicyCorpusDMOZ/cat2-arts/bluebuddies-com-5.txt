Questions and Answers:
Who created Smurfette and why?
One day, while feeling extremely frustrated and spiteful, Gargamel decided on a new plan to exact revenge on the Smurfs, "a ruthless curse that will make them beg for mercy". Gargamel decided to send them a female Smurf - a Smurfette!
How was Smurfette created and what is she made of?
Smurfette was made in the wizard Gargamel's laboratory. She was created by a magical potion. Her list of ingredients include: "Sugar and spice but nothing nice...A dram of crocodile tears...A peck of bird brain...The tip of an adder's tongue...Half a pack of lies, white, of course...The slyness of a cat...The vanity of a peacock...The chatter of a magpie...The guile of a vixen and the disposition of a shrew...And of course the hardest stone for her heart...."
The Smurfs will return after these messages:
Where did Smurfette first appear to the Smurfs and what did she look like?
Smurfette is discovered by a single Smurf in the forest, wailing to herself and lamenting her unhappy lot in life. She explains to the Smurf that unless she is rescued, she will surely perish. Smurfette is a brunette with straight, stringy hair, ugly eyelashes, a plain dress and large plain shoes.
Was Smurfette really evil?
Well, evil would certainly be too harsh a term. Trouble would definitely be a more appopriate word. And boy, could she cause trouble. As well, she was a really, really bad singer (so off-key that even Harmony Smurf noticed).
How did Papa Smurf get involved?
Papa Smurf is the Smurf who turned everything around for Smurfette. After a successful operation of "plastic smurfery", Papa Smurf transformed the ugly (and unhappy) brunette Smurfette into the blond bombshell she is today.
What happened after Smurfette's transformation?
The Smurfs were very pleased with the new and improved Smurfette. The truth was eventually revealed to Papa Smurf and the others that Gargamel created the first incarnation of Smurfette, but her improved disposition and appearance helped the Smurfs accept Smurfette as one of their own.
Is Smurfette SEXIST?
