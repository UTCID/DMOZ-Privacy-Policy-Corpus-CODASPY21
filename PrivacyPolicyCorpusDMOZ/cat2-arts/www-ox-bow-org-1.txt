How We Use Your InformationAll of the personal information we collect from our customers is for the purpose of the reasoning described above, as well as:processing, verifying, validating, and completing your transaction creating, managing, and maintaining your relationship to Ox-Bow providing requested live customer support and services record keeping of your purchase and donation history enabling communication via our Site, blog, and social networks managing your participation in contests and promotions sending email as appropriate (See Section C: Email & Other Communications) E. Students at Ox-Bow Ox-Bow is affiliated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). When registering for a class at Ox-Bow, a student id number for SAIC is generated. Ox-Bow will share registration information, such as name, address, course, room and board choice with SAIC. Students enrolling in a for-credit course will be billed by SAIC directly, thus SAIC may request financial information directly from the student. Non-Credit students pay for their courses and related fees directly to Ox-Bow. Ox-Bow will share payment status and type, such as check or credit card payment with SAIC but will not share actual account processing information with SAIC, unless requested by the student. F. For-Credit Students at Ox-Bow and consequently SAIC, are protected by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) This Act, with which Ox-Bow and SAIC comply, was designated to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their educational records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings.Students also have the right to file complaints with the FERPA office concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the act. School policy explains in detail the procedures to be used by SAIC for compliance with the FERPA provisions. Copies of this policy may be found in the Office of the Registrar. The Office of Registration and Records also maintains a directory of records listing all educational records maintained on students at SAIC.Questions concerning FERPA may be referred to the academic records officer, located in the Registration and Records office.FERPA Student Information Release Authorization Form can be found here. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include the following: The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day SAIC receives a written request for access. Students should submit to Registration and Records a written request identifying the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Director of Registration and Records makes arrangements for access and notifies the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the Registration and Records office, the Director shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.  The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask SAIC to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write to the Director of Registration and Records, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. If SAIC decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, SAIC notifies the student of the decision and advises the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures is provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.  The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom SAIC has contracted as its agent to provide service instead of using SAIC employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, or insurance company); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities with SAIC operations and functions. Directory InformationFERPA prohibits access by non-school personnel to information about individual students without the student’s written authorization, except that which is considered public information. SAIC hereby designates the following as public or “directory information.” Such information may be disclosed by SAIC for any purpose, at its discretion (Ox-Bow will not share the following information with administrative personnel. For example, if you would like to contact a former fellow student we are happy to email them on you behalf but will not give you’re their contact information directly): Student name(s)  Student address(es), electronic address (e-mail) and telephone number  Dates of admission/attendance  Degrees and awards received  Previous institutions attended  Date and place of birth  Expected graduation date  Current term hours enrolled and enrollment status (full-time, part-time, not enrolled, withdrawn and date of withdrawal) Prevent Release of Directory InformationTo Prevent Release of Directory Information, you must submit a written request to the Office of Registration and Records no later than the 10th day of the semester (fifth day of summer session). Such requests for nondisclosure are honored so long as you are continuously enrolled or unless you sooner revoke the request in writing.G.
