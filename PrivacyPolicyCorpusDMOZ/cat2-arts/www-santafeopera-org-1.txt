Privacy Policy
The Santa Fe Opera is committed to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of your personally identifiable information or PII.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
There are several places on this Web site where the visitor’s personally identifiable information may be provided to The Santa Fe Opera through account registration, order forms, application forms, or survey forms. In filling out these forms you may be asked for contact information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address), financial information (credit card related) and demographic information (age, gender, education level, income level, etc.).
As with most other Internet sites, our Web servers record the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each visitor. This IP address tells us from which domain (such as aol.com) you are visiting, but not your e-mail address. We use the information to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Web site more effectively and to gather broad demographic information.
When providing this personally identifiable information, you are indicating to us your consent that we use it in accordance with the terms and provisions of this policy. This site utilizes cookies to keep track of the visitor's shopping cart and for other purposes.
WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION
We use contact information to send visitors new information about The Santa Fe Opera and its programs through an opt-in request process. The visitor's contact information may also be used at other times when necessary—for example: contact may be related to an online purchase if warranted. The Santa Fe Opera may on occasion share segments of its mailing list with other non-profit organizations for mutually beneficial programs. We do not rent or sell our mailing list with for-profit entities.
The visitor’s financial information is used to execute purchase and donation transactions. We share this information with credit card and check processing organizations as necessary to complete the transactions. The Santa Fe Opera does not retain the identifying financial account information once a transaction is completed.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
We are committed to the highest standard of stewardship. Written Company policy makes it the obligation of each Santa Fe Opera employee to protect the confidentiality of our patron information. The Opera takes substantial precautions in seeking to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards, including the application of firewalls. When appropriate, we employ user authentication systems, encryption technologies and access control mechanisms.
