Information CBI Gathers and Tracks
CBI gathers two types of information about users:
•    Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:
•    Information CBI gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs. Under no circumstances does CBI divulge any information about an individual user or station to a third party that is not already public information.
