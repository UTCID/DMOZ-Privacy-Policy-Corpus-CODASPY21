GSN TERMS OF SERVICE
Effective
Date:  August 3, 2020
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS
OF SERVICE AND GSN’s PRIVACY POLICY LOCATED AT  http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html
BEFORE USING ANY GSN WEBSITE, APPLICATION OR ANY OF THE GSN COMMUNITY
FEATURES.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN A BINDING
ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  THIS AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ON
HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH GSN.
SECTION
1 – GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1
– Terms of Service Binding
These terms of service (the “Terms of Service” or “TOS“) apply to your use of the online and mobile
websites (each, a “Website”) operated by GSN Games, Inc. or one of its affiliates
or subsidiaries (collectively “GSN”), any interactive applications (each, an “Application”)
operated by GSN and the GSN “Community Features” (as defined herein) (unless a
different terms of use or terms and conditions is provided on a particular
Website, Application or Community Feature, in which case such different policy
shall control).   The Website, the Applications and the Community
Features are collectively referred to as the “Services.”  Your use of the Services constitutes
your unconditional agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do
not agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, you may not access or
otherwise use the Services. To participate in Community Features and certain
other activities you will need to become a registered User and create an
account (each, an “Account“).
These TOS govern everyone who uses the Services (each, “you” or a “User“), whether
they are registered or not.  Interactive games that are made available on
the Services or are accessible from the Services are operated by GSN Games,
Inc., (“GSN Games”).
All references in these Terms of Service to “GSN” in connection with the
interactive games that are made available on or are accessible from the
Services will be deemed to extend to and include GSN Games.   Please
note, however, that if you elect to participate in any interactive games
offered on or through the Services, you may be re-directed to other URLs
(collectively, the “GSN Games Sites”), and your activity on the GSN Games
Sites may be governed by additional terms and policies that may reside on the
GSN Games Sites.
These TOS, the GSN Privacy Policy, and any other terms and
conditions incorporated herein (collectively, the “Other Policies“), constitute the entire agreement
between you and GSN pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior or other arrangements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written. No waiver of any of the provisions of these TOS shall
constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.
The Services are intended solely for users who are eighteen (18)
years of age and older. Excluding WorldWinner, the Services are not available
to residents of Quebec.  Individuals who are under the age of eighteen
(18) should not access the Services.
1.2
– License to Use
GSN grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right
and license to access, use and privately display the Services and the materials
thereon, including the “Services Content” (as defined below) for your personal
use only, provided that you comply fully with these Terms of Service. You may
“cache” pages of the Services for the sole purpose of increasing the speed and
efficiency at which you access the Services in the future. You shall not
interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation of the Services in any way
through any means or device including, but not limited to, spamming, hacking,
uploading computer viruses or time bombs, or any other means expressly
prohibited by any provision of these TOS.
1.3
– Changes to the Services and/or Terms of Service
GSN reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify,
update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change any portion of the
Services, these TOS, or the Other Policies, in whole or in part, at any time.
When GSN amends these TOS, it will revise the “last updated” date located at
the bottom of these TOS for an amount of time that we determine in our
discretion. For material changes to these TOS, GSN may notify you by displaying
a notice when you first use the Services after such changes have been
made.  We may also, at our discretion, provide notification of changes by
other means.  If you use the Services in any way after these TOS or Other
Policies have been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally
consented and agreed to such changes. The most current version of these TOS
will be available on the Website and will supersede all previous versions of
these TOS.
1.4
– Changes in Services Ownership
As set forth more fully in the Privacy Policy, you will be
deemed to have consented to the transfer and/or disclosure to a subsequent
owner of the Services of any Personal Data (as defined in our Privacy Policy)
submitted by you and contained in GSN’s database if GSN assigns your Personal
Data to a third party as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger,
acquisition, or sale of the Services, in whole or in part, of all or
substantially all of GSN’s assets.
1.5
– Linked Websites
The Services may contain links to third party websites or
resources, which may or may not be obvious (“Third Party Sites”) as well as software, text,
graphics, articles, photographs, pictures, designs, sound, video, music,
information, software applications and other content originating from third
parties (collectively, “Third Party Applications, Software or Content”).
Our provision of links to Third Party Sites is not an endorsement of any
information, product or service that is offered on or reached through such
Third Party Site or Third Party Application, Software or Content.  Such
Third Party Sites and Third Party Applications, Software or Content are not
monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and
we are not responsible for the content or performance of any Third Party Sites
accessed through the Services or any Third Party Applications, Software or
Content posted on, available through or installed from the Services, including
the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices
or other policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or the Third Party
Applications, Software or Content. If you decide to leave the Services and
access the Third Party Sites or to use or install any Third Party Applications,
Software or Content, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that
our terms and policies no longer govern.
1.6
– No Resale / Exploitation by Licensee
You may not reproduce, copy, resell, manipulate, or exploit any
part of the Services or the “Services Materials” (as defined below), for any
commercial purpose.
1.7
– Account Termination / Prohibited Access
GSN may, in its sole discretion and at any time, with or without
notice, terminate your password, Account or use of any Community Feature, and
discard and remove any “Community Content” (as defined below) posted or
submitted by you to any Community Feature, for any reason or no reason. GSN may
also, in its sole discretion and at any time, with or without notice,
discontinue any Community Feature or limit or restrict any User access thereto,
for any reason or no reason at all. Should GSN take any of these actions, it
may, in its sole discretion, immediately deactivate your Account.  Following
deactivation, GSN will delete all information about and concerning your
Account, including your “Registration Information” (as defined below) and
submitted Community Content, unless GSN is required to store such information for
the protection and pursuit of its legal rights and obligations under any laws
that are applicable to its operations. Additionally, if your access to the
Services and/or the GSN Games Sites has been terminated or suspended by GSN for
any reason, you are not eligible to enter or participate in any GSN programs or
promotions (including, without limitation, any sweepstakes, contests or
giveaways) or to win any prizes. You understand and agree that GSN shall not
have any liability to you or any other person for any suspension or termination
of your access to any Community Feature and/or the removal of information
concerning your Account.
1.8
– Governing Law and Disputes
These TOS shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of California and the United States of America,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law principles that
would result in the application of any other State’s laws.
By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent
and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract,
tort, or otherwise) you may have against GSN or the officers, directors and
employees of GSN and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals
and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Company Entities”) arising out
of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination
of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted
before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this
arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§
1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California; (4) the
arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these
Terms of Service and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the
applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the
arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the FAA and applicable
statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
(6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or
representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable
Company Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join
the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the
arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or
any Company Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits
that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Company Entity exceed
$125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay
any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, GSN agrees to pay them and/or
forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the
arbitrator.  In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company
will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration
as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part
of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of
this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in
accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or
conflicting provision were not contained herein.  If, however, subpart (6)
is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this
Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor GSN shall be
entitled to arbitrate their dispute.  For more information on JAMS and/or
the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com.
The Services are controlled and operated by GSN from its offices
within the State of California, United States of America (“U.S.A.”). GSN makes
no representation that the Services and/or the Services Content, including
merchandise offered for sale on the Services, and their copyrights, trademarks,
patents, and licensing arrangements, are appropriate or available for use in
locations other than the U.S.A. Those who choose to access the Services from
locations outside of the U.S.A. do so on their own initiative and at their own
risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws.  Use of the
Services, the GSN Game Sites, and the Websites is void where prohibited by
applicable law, and, excluding WorldWinner, void in the Province of Quebec,
Canada.  With respect to shipments of merchandise to consumers, wherever
they may reside, title to the merchandise and risk of loss shall pass to the
buyer upon delivery of the merchandise to the common carrier.
Software from the Services is further subject to United States
export controls. No software from the Services may be downloaded or otherwise
exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) North Korea,
Iran, Syria, Sudan or any other country subject to U.S. embargo or trade
sanctions; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of
Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny
Orders. By downloading or using the Software, you represent and warrant that you
are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any
such country or on any such list.
SECTION
2 – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
2.1
– Ownership of trademarks, copyrights and patents
As between Users and GSN, Services Content is different from
“Community Content”. “Community Content” consists of User-generated content,
information, and materials of any kind or nature that is included or posted by
Users in the Community Features sections of the Website or an Application
(collectively, “Community
Content“). The Services and all of the content the Services contain,
or may in the future contain, including but not limited to all copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade names and patents (collectively, the “Services Content“)
is proprietary to GSN and its affiliates. The Services Content and the
programming codes associated therewith (“Services Code“) as they exist on the Services are
offered to you by GSN for limited and restricted use pursuant to these TOS.
Services Content and Services Code are collectively referred to herein as the “Services  Materials“.
Any use of the Services Materials other than as permitted by these TOS will
constitute a violation of these TOS and may constitute copyright and/or patent
infringement.
The Services Materials are owned by GSN and/or its licensors and
content providers, and are protected by copyright, trademark, publicity and
other laws and by international treaties. Unless expressly permitted in writing
by GSN, you shall not capture, reproduce, perform, transfer, sell, license,
modify, create derivative works from or based upon, republish, reverse
engineer, upload, edit, post, transmit, publicly display, frame, link,
distribute, or exploit in whole or in part any Services Materials. You agree
not to use the Services Materials for any unlawful purposes.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, use
of the Services Materials on any third party website or other networked
computer environment is prohibited without prior written permission from GSN.
2.2
– Use of Software
From time to time, and at its sole discretion, GSN may make
available to Users certain software that may be accessible or downloaded from
the Services. In the event that you access or download software from the
Services, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or
generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively,
the “Software“)
are licensed to you by GSN or a GSN-approved third party software provider (“Third Party Provider“).
GSN does not transfer title to the Software to you. You own the medium on which
the Software is recorded, but GSN retains full and complete title to its
Software, and all intellectual property rights therein. For purposes of these
TOS, such Software shall be deemed included in the definition of “Services
Materials”. Furthermore, your use of any Software of a Third Party Provider
shall be subject to the end user license agreement or any other terms of use
set forth by such Third Party Provider for its Software.
2.3
– Submissions
GSN is pleased to hear from its Users and welcomes your comments
regarding GSN’s Services and products. Nevertheless, GSN’s long-standing
company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas,
suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested (see
below). While we value your feedback of our Services and products, we request
that you be specific in your comments of those Services and products, and that
you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials. We hope you will
understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of
future misunderstandings when projects developed by GSN’s or its affiliates’
professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative
work. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any original creative
materials such as game concepts/treatments, stories or character ideas,
screenplays, or original artwork.
If you send or post certain specific submissions at our request
(e.g., via message boards or in connection with contests) or if you send us
creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or any other
information (each, a “Submission” and collectively, the “Submissions“) despite our request that you not send us
any unsolicited Submissions or other creative materials, the Submission will be
treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance. For purposes
of this Paragraph 2.3, all Community Content shall be deemed included in the
definition of Submissions. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any
obligation of confidentiality on the part of GSN, and GSN shall not be liable
for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Any Submission may be used by GSN
without restriction for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation,
reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast or posting, and
you hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any claim that any use of
such Submission violates any of your rights, including, without limitation, copyrights,
trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights,
publicity rights, or right to credit for the material or ideas. GSN shall have
and is irrevocably granted the right, but not the obligation, to reproduce,
modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, license, perform, post, sell, translate,
incorporate, create derivative works from, distribute and otherwise use the
Submission in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the
universe, in perpetuity, without according you any compensation or credit. By
submitting a Submission to the Services or GSN, you represent that such
Submission is original with you and does not violate or infringe upon the
rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, any intellectual
property rights and rights of publicity and/or privacy. All Submissions to the
Services and/or GSN shall be the sole property of GSN and will not be
acknowledged or returned. You agree and understand that GSN is not obligated to
use any Submission you make to the Services or GSN and you have no right to
compel such use. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your relationship with
GSN is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that
your decision to submit any material to GSN does not place GSN in a position
that is any different from the position held by members of the general public
with regard to your Submission. You understand and acknowledge that GSN has
wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary materials, and that
new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by GSN’s own
employees. Many ideas or stories may be competitive with, similar or identical
to your Submission in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects. You
acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any compensation as a
result of GSN’s use of any such similar or identical material. Finally, you
acknowledge that, with respect to any claim you may have relating to or arising
out of a GSN’s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any material you submit
to the Services and/or GSN, the damage, if any, thereby caused will not be
irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other
equitable relief or to enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition or other
exploitation of any production based on or allegedly based on the material, and
your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the
right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law. Applicable law may
restrict or limit the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. If so, without
limitation of the foregoing, you agree that in no event shall GSN’s liability
exceed $5,000.
2.4
– Copyright Notice
If you are a copyright owner and believe that any Services
Materials or Community Content appearing on the Services or in any Community
Feature has been copied in a way that infringes upon your copyrights, you may
submit a notification to GSN pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(“DMCA“)
by providing the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for
further detail) to the Copyright Agent named below:
·
Your
name, address, telephone number, and email address;
·
A
description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if
multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a
representative list of such works;
·
The
exact URL or a description reasonably sufficient to permit GSN to locate where
the alleged infringing material is located;
·
A
statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
·
An
electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of the copyright interest; and
·
A
statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in
your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to
act on the copyright owner’s behalf.  Copyright Agent:
GSN
Games, Inc.

Monica, CA 90404
Attn:
GSN Games, Business Affairs
Fax: (310) 255-6989 E-Mail:
legal@gsngames.com
Upon receipt of the written notification as outlined above, GSN
will use good faith, reasonable efforts to remove the material that is alleged
to be infringing and forward a copy of the written notification to the alleged
infringer. The alleged infringer has the right to file a counter-notification
by providing the designated agent with the following information: (1) a
physical or electronic signature; (2) identification of the material that has
been removed the location at which the material appeared before it was removed;
(3) a statement under penalty of perjury that he/she has a good faith belief
that the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification of
the material to be removed; and (4) his/her name, address, and telephone
number, and a statement that he/she consents to the jurisdiction of Federal
District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if
his/her address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in
which the service provider may be found, and that he/she will accept service of
process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or
an agent of such person. By this filing, GSN seeks to preserve any and all
exemptions from liability that may be available under the DMCA or otherwise but
does not necessarily stipulate that it is a service provider as defined in 17
USC § 512c or elsewhere in the law.
SECTION
3 – COMMUNITY FEATURES
Section
3.1 – General Community Information
In consideration for your use of the Community Features and
functionality, you agree to: (i) comply with the “Community Guidelines” set forth below; (ii) provide GSN
with accurate, complete and true information about yourself as required on the
registration form (your “Registration Information“) in order to create your
Account; and (iii) maintain and update, as applicable, your Registration
Information with current and complete information. Users who violate the
Community Guidelines, or provide inaccurate, false, or non-current Registration
Information may, at GSN’s sole discretion, have their Accounts suspended or
terminated, and may be permanently banned from using the Services and/or any
other GSN service, and may be subject to any other penalty determined by GSN.
As part of your Account, you will be responsible for creating
and maintaining the confidentiality of, your username and password. We ask that
you select a username other than your real name or the real name of any other
person. We also urge you to memorize your password or keep it in a secure
place, away from the rest of your Account information, as sharing your password
with others may lead to unauthorized access to your Account information. You
are responsible for all activity occurring under your Account. You agree that
you will: (i) immediately notify GSN of any unauthorized use of your username
or password; and (ii) ensure that you properly exit a Community Feature at the
completion of your session. GSN shall have no liability for any loss or damage
arising from your Account or your failure to comply with these requirements.
Section
3.2 – Profiles, Buddy Lists, Comment Walls, Virtual Assets and Private or
Public Communications
To enhance User experience, GSN provides or may provide, at its
sole discretion, one or more chat areas, message boards, e-mail functions,
messaging services, file communities, virtual communities featuring digital or
virtual assets, polls, surveys, and other services (collectively, the “Community Features“).
Community Features are provided by GSN to you and others subject to the TOS,
the “Community Guidelines” set forth below and the Other Policies. The User who
posts Community Content in the Community Features is responsible for the reliability,
accuracy and truthfulness of such Community Content, and GSN has no control
over such Community Content. Additionally, GSN has no control over whether any
such posted material is of a nature that Users will find offensive, distasteful
or otherwise unacceptable and expressly disclaims any responsibility for such
material.
ENTERING ANY COMMUNITY FEATURE WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF THE
COMMUNITY GUIDELINES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES,
PLEASE DO NOT ENTER ANY COMMUNITY FEATURES.
Section
3.3 – Community Guidelines

conducted that are associated with your Account within the Community Features,

Information disclosed in Community Features is, by design,
revealed to the public. GSN is not responsible for any information you choose
to disclose to others. GSN reserves the right, but not the obligation, to
remove any posts for any reason. GSN does not endorse the Community Content in the
Community Features and specifically disclaims any responsibility or liability
to any person or entity (including, without limitation, persons who may use or
rely on such material) for any loss, damage (whether actual, consequential,
punitive or otherwise), injury, claim, liability or other cause of any kind or
character based upon or resulting from any Services Materials or Community
Content provided through a Community Feature. Without in any way limiting the
generality of Paragraph 2.3 of these TOS, by posting or uploading Community
Content to any Community Feature or submitting any other Community Content to
GSN, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has
expressly granted) GSN a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
translate, sub-license, create derivative works from and distribute such
materials or incorporate such Community Content into any form, medium, or
technology now known or hereafter devised. In addition, you warrant that the
content as uploaded or posted by you does not violate any person’s so-called
“moral rights” or other similar or analogous rights under any applicable laws
in any country or region of the world.
You understand that the uploading to and/or posting of any
Community Content in any Community Feature shall not be subject to any
obligation of confidence on the part of GSN, and GSN shall not be liable for
any use or disclosure of any Community Content. By posting or uploading any
Community Content to the Service, any Forum or submitting any other content to
GSN, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has
granted) GSN a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable non-exclusive right
and license to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, publicly perform, translate,
sublicense, create derivative works from, exploit, distribute and otherwise use
such materials or incorporate such materials in or in connection with the
Services or by or in  any and all media, now known or hereafter devised,
throughout the universe, in perpetuity for any purpose whatsoever, commercial
or otherwise, without compensation or credit to the provider, author or owner
of the Community Content.  In addition, you represent and warrant that any
and all Community Content you upload, post, transmit, send, share, store
distribute or otherwise make available on the Service complies with each of the
foregoing Community Guidelines.
From time to time, GSN may offer Users the opportunity to create
or acquire digital or virtual assets (collectively, “Virtual Assets“). Such
opportunities are considered Community Features, and the Community Guidelines
shall apply to them, but such Virtual Assets also involve additional considerations.
In particular: (1) each User acknowledges and agrees that they are granted a
limited, non-exclusive license to use the Virtual Assets in connection with,
and solely as a part of, their use of the Services and then only for the
duration permitted by GSN, and Users shall have no ownership or property right,
title, or interest in or expectation of the Virtual Assets, and any use of the
Virtual Assets other than as permitted by these TOS will constitute a violation
of these TOS and may constitute copyright infringement; (2) any modifications,
combinations, alterations or other changes that a User makes to any Virtual
Assets (“Alterations“)
shall be deemed a work-made-for hire for GSN and GSN shall be considered the
author and sole copyright owner of all rights and of all proceeds derived from
the Alterations, with the right to make changes and use, in whole or in part,
as GSN may determine, together with all neighboring, rental, lending, fixation,
reproduction, distribution and any and all other ownership and exploitation
rights recognized in any territory, by all means, media, devices, processes and
technology, and all rights generally known as the “moral rights of authors”,
and to the extent such Alterations do not constitute a work-made-for-hire, each
applicable User hereby grants, transfers, sells and assigns all right, title
and interest therein to GSN throughout the universe in perpetuity; and (3)
Virtual Assets have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash and may not
be sold, auctioned, bartered, brokered, purchased outside of the Services or
used to engage in any gambling activity. Any Virtual Assets obtained in this
manner will be considered to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void.
For all other purposes of these TOS, Alterations shall be considered Community
Content.
You agree to indemnify GSN for any and all third party claims,
damages, losses, and causes of action arising as a result of your posting or
uploading any Community Content to any Community Feature or submitting any
Community Content to GSN, or your failure to comply with the Community
Guidelines. GSN does not and cannot review every message posted by users on the
Services, and is not responsible for the content of these messages or the views
or opinions expressed by the Users of the Services. GSN reserves the right to,
but is not obligated to, delete, move or edit Community Content, in whole or in
part, submitted by you to the Services and/or GSN for any reason. In no event
does GSN assume any obligation to monitor the Community Features or remove any
specific material.

3.4 – Promotional Activities
By registering for an Account, you agree that the Services may
display your username throughout the Services, including, but not limited to
areas such as leader boards, individual tournament records, message boards,
chat rooms, etc. By accepting any prize from the Services, Users (except Users
resident in the EU and the UK) agree to allow GSN to print, publish, broadcast
and use, and to authorize its affiliates and distributors to print, publish,
broadcast and use, on a worldwide basis, in any and all media now known or
hereafter devised, your name, picture, voice, likeness, statements,
biographical information, a description of the prize(s) you won and any other
personal characteristics for any purpose, including without limitation,
promotional or related purposes without additional compensation, and you
release GSN from any liability with respect thereto.  GSN will only carry out
any of the above activities in relation to Users resident in the EU and the UK
in circumstances where such Users have consented to GSN carrying out those
activities. Please note that sweepstakes, contests or promotions offered via
the Services may be, and often are, governed by a separate set of rules that,
in addition to describing such sweepstakes, contest or promotion, may have
eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions,
terms and conditions governing the use of material you submit, and disclosures
about how your personal information may be used. It is your responsibility to
read such rules to determine whether or not you want to and are eligible to
participate, register and/or enter. By entering any such sweepstakes, contest
or other promotion, you agree to comply with and abide by such rules and the
decisions of the sponsor(s), which shall be final and binding in all respects.
Section
3.5 – Privacy Policy
Submissions are governed by these TOS even if they
include information about you or information that could be used to personally
identify you. Any Personal Data collected through the Services will be governed
by GSN’s Privacy Policy located at  http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html,
which is incorporated into these TOS by reference.
Section
3.6 – Anti-Spam Policy
The Services are vigorously against the practice commonly
referred to as “Spamming.” Any User who is reported to be generating Spam, and
whose “Spamming” is validated by the Services, will have their respective
Accounts either immediately TERMINATED or SUSPENDED, at the sole discretion of
GSN. Additionally, any prizes (if any) may be voided at the sole discretion of
GSN. GSN defines “Spam” as it is commonly understood, and includes the
following:
·
Electronic
mail messages and commercial electronic messages addressed to a recipient with
whom the initiator does not have an existing business or personal relationship
or is not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the
recipient;
·
Messages
posted to message boards that are off-topic (unrelated to the topic of
discussion), cross-posted to unrelated newsgroups, or posted in excessive
volume; or
·
Solicitations
posted to chat rooms or sent to groups or individuals via Internet Relay Chat
or “Instant Messaging” system (such as ICQ).
GSN may undertake, at its sole discretion and with or without
prior notice, the following enforcement actions described in detail below:
·
Account Suspension: Upon the
receipt of a credible and validated complaint, GSN may elect to immediately
suspend the membership of the User implicated in the abuse. Suspension serves
as a “final” warning and will prevent the abuser from continuing his/her
abusive “Spamming” behavior. GSN will evaluate each validated abuse incident on
a case-by-case basis and impose termination or suspension at its sole
discretion, and may void any associated prizes. GSN reserves the right to lift
the suspension of a User at any time, at its sole discretion.
·
Account Termination: Upon the receipt
of a credible and validated complaint, GSN may immediately terminate the
membership of the individual User implicated in the abuse and may void any
associated winnings.
However, GSN makes no representation or warranty about any third
party’s compliance or non-compliance with Canada’s Anti-Spam Law.
