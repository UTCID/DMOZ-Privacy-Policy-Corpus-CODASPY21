2. Additional Terms
Some of our Services have additional terms and conditions (“Additional Terms”).  Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, we will make them available for you to read through your use of that Service.  By using that Service, you agree to the Additional Terms.
3. Acceptable Use of the Site and Services
You are responsible for your use of the Site and Services, and for any use of the Site or Services made using your account.  Our goal is to create a positive, useful, and safe user experience.  To promote this goal, we prohibit certain kinds of conduct that may be harmful to other users or to us.  When you use the Site or Services, you may not:

4. User Content
The Site and some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send, or receive content and data (“User Content”).  You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that User Content.  In other words, you own your personal data.
When you upload, submit, store, send, or receive User Content to or through the Site or Services, you give us permission to reproduce and use your User Content as follows:  you grant to us and those we work with a license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so that User Content works better with the Site and Services), publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content.  This license is for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Site and Services, and to develop new Services.  Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use the User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for their purposes.  This license is fully-paid and royalty free, meaning we do not owe you anything else in connection with our use of your User Content.  We may exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the world.  Lastly, this license is perpetual, meaning that our rights under this license continue even after you stop using the Site and Services.  In general, however, we will only need to use your User Content for as long as you choose to store it with us using the Site or Services.
You promise that:
• you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the right to give us the rights described above; and

Telephone:  619-258-1207
Fax:  619-258-4308
E-mail:  dmcaagent@taylorguitars.com
For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright Agent.  You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section your notice may not be valid.
If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing the following information:
• Your physical or electronic signature;
• Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
• A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
• Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Diego, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement.  Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information.  By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.  We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.
After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled.  If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the material.  If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.
7. Third Party Websites and Social Platforms
Our Site and Services may contain links to and from other websites or allow you to share content on third party websites or social platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter.  A link to a third party’s website or social platform does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it.  We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third party websites or social platforms.  You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website and social platform before using it.
8. Privacy
Your privacy is very important to us.  Our Privacy Policy (https://www.taylorguitars.com/legal/privacy-policy) explains how we collect, use, protect, and when we share personal information and other data with others.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your username and password.  You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and you agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use of your account.  We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to any unauthorized access or use of your account.
9. Third Party Interactions
The Site and Services may contain features and functionalities that may help you locate third party dealers.  Your interactions with organizations or individuals found on or through the Site and Services are solely between you and such organizations or individuals.  You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any interaction with any of these third parties.  You agree that our Company is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind or nature incurred as the result of any such dealings.

We enhance and update the Site and Services often.  We may change or discontinue the Site or Services at any time, with or without notice to you.
11. Termination
We reserve the right to not provide the Site or Services to any person.  We also reserve the right to terminate any user’s right to access the Site or Services at any time, in our discretion.  If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Site and Services automatically terminates.
12. Open Source
