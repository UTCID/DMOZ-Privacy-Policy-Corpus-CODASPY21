Artist's Notes: All measurements are approximate. All artwork is handcrafted and will have the characteristics of such. Nothing will be exact. The Artwork, if glass, may have a bubble(s), but if offered for sale, the artist has deemed the quality/beauty of the piece is not affected by such. Some bubbles are intentional relating to the design. All items are one-of-a-kind and cannot be duplicated / copied. The Artist is however possibly able to create something very similar.
