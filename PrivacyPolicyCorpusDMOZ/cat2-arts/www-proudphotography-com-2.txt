Enrollment
Once a student’s payment is accepted, the student becomes enrolled in the course and the course materials are then made available to the student. The student will be assigned a personal tutor(s) who will give feedback and grade the student’s work. Student’s successfully completing the course(s) will receive a Certificate of Completion.
Students have no deadline in which to complete a course, provided, however, if courses are not completed within a purchased enrollment time, a new enrollment fee is due if the student wishes to continue the course. Once enrollment fees are paid, the student can then continue the course without interruption for as long as the purchased enrollment period is valid. There is no limit to how many times a student can enroll in the course. Enrollment periods for different courses may vary. The enrollment period is specified in the course's description and it's students' responsibility to check and understand what the enrollment period for their particular course is.
Students understand and acknowledge that while the Company offers money back guarantees (MBG) in certain situations, the Company’s MBG policy may be different for different courses, and the student is obligated to be familiar with the MBG for each course. Nevertheless, in all situations the MBG is available only if one of the following occurred:
a) student who enrolled in the course never actually started the course, that is, never submitted assignments or had access to the course materials, or
b) if after completing the entire course including all assignments and exercises, a student is still not satisfied with the results.
