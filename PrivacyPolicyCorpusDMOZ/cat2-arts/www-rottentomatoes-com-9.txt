Unusually for fare of this type, the end results are never once annoying.

Likable. Enjoyable. Funny. Entertaining. You'll smile. You'll laugh. You'll even root for the blonde. And yes, it is acceptable to put your resume on pink paper.

Reese Witherspoon is just so charming in it.

March 1, 2019
A cut (and style) above other comedies of this ilk, Legally Blonde mainly succeeds because of Witherspoon's winning performance.

Reese Witherspoon is the single-best thing about Legally Blonde, a comedy that has no business being as fun and entertaining as it is.

The movie is a lot like 1995's Clueless, which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks.

Slick, sexy, and charming, this romantic comedy should catapult the gifted Reese Witherspoon to major movie stardom

"Legally Blonde" is a career misstep for a talented actress capable of creating much more complex characters.

Legally Blonde is a broad, glossy teen comedy that shows off Witherspoon's wicked comic talents. Silly? You bet. But if this Popsicle of a movie melts long before it's over, the first half has more good laughs than all of "Sweethearts."
