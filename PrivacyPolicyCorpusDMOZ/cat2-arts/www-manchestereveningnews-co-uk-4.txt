And Prof Brian has seemingly addressed the issue in a simple message: "For those who have privacy concerns about the NHS Covid app, it uses Apple and Google’s API, not governments. "If you are a conspiracy theorist and don’t trust Apple and Google, remember you have installed their OS anyway so it makes no difference!" The Department of Health and Social Care say the app is designed to the "highest standards of data privacy and data security" and uses proven technology from Apple and Google.
The DHSC added that it doesn't track individuals and does not hold personal information about individuals such as name, address or date of birth. For some features the app may require more information from the user - such as when booking a Covid-19 test - but only if the user gives their explicit consent.ManchesterEveningNewsFollow @MENNewsdeskMore OnCoronavirusNational news
