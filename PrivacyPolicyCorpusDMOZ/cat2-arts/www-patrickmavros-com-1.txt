International Transfers:
We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA)Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

- We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or- Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or- Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.

Data Security:
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

Heart of Africa. I recently made a small purchase and was very impressed with the great service. My order arrived in Liverpool within 2 days as promised and was beautifully wrapped and accompanied by a gift bag. The order was for a dear friend’s birthday and she was delighted with her Heart of Africa earrings. Thank you.
