I use ethical internet services who respect user privacy as far as I can, but some companies I use to administer this site are undeniably creepy. My apologies, I will continue to look for alternatives.
I use Google reCAPTCHA on my contact form to prevent spam. Here is their Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en
I use Mailchimp to administer my mailing list. Here is their Privacy Policy for Contacts.
