How is My Information Used for Targeted Advertising?
We work with third parties that use their own technologies to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. During your visit to this web site, those third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information, such as, but not limited to, click stream information, your IP address, and time and date. This information may be used to analyze and track data as well as provide advertisements that may be of interest to you. Additional information about third-party advertising and opting out of having your browsing information used for advertising purposes can be found at www.networkadvertising.org.
For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.
We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on third-party platforms (such as Facebook or Google). As part of these ad campaigns, we or third-party platforms may convert information about you, such as your email address, into a unique value that can be matched with a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and to serve you advertising that is customized to your interests. Note that the third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see these types of customized ads.

Cookies and Interest- Based Advertising
You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.

Alternatively, for some devices you may use your device’s platform controls in your settings to exercise choice.
Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. For more information about how we use cookies, please read our cookie policy.

Consent is not required to purchase goods or services.

European Residents
If you are a European Resident, defined for the purposes of this Privacy Policy to include residents of the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.
Legal Basis for Processing
If you are a European Resident, we process your personal data when:
·
We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the rag & bone products you have ordered).
·
We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data for performance marketing activities, to conduct data analytics and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.
·
We need to do so to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
·
We need to do so to protect your vital interests or those of others.
·
We have your consent to do so, which you may withdraw at any time.
Data Subject Requests
If you are a European Resident, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, updated, or erased. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us as indicated below. If you have a rag & bone account, you may also review, update, and delete certain personal data by logging into your account.
Questions or Complaints
If you are a European Resident and have a concern about how we process personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you live. For contact details of your relevant local Data Protection Authority, please see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm or, if you are a resident of Switzerland, https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/contact/.
Your California Privacy Rights
California Consumer Privacy Act:
This section provides details about rights afforded to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (or "CCPA"), and supplemental details about the personal information we collect about California residents.
In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name, contact information and device identifiers); commercial information (such as items purchased); internet or other network activity information (such as browsing behavior and other usage data); location data; inferences (such as purchasing preferences); demographic data (such as gender); electronic, visual or similar information (such as customer support call information); professional or employment-related information (such as in resumes you provide); and other personal information (such as product feedback or payment method information). For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the What information does rag & bone collect section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION & DOES RAG & BONE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHERS sections above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the HOW IS MY INFORMATION USED FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING section above.
Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California residents the right to request to access to details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we have collected in the last 12 months (including about information we disclosed for a business purpose), to request to delete their personal information, to opt out of any sales that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
We do use third-party cookies and related technologies to send targeted ads and this may be deemed a "sale" under the CCPA. To opt out of these "sales," please visit the following page Do Not Sell My Personal Info.
California residents may make request access or deletion requests by emailing us at privacy@rag-bone.com. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. You can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights. This generally means we will not deny you goods or services, charge different prices or rates, provide a different level of service or quality of goods, or suggest that you might receive a different price or level of quality for goods. Please know, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require usage of your personal information to function.
To exercise the California privacy rights described above, please write us at privacy@rag-bone.com or call us toll free at +1-844-RAG-BONE (724-2663) 8am to 11pm ET, 7 days a week.
Your California Privacy Rights — Shine the Light:
If you are a California resident, California law permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by rag & bone to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. Rag & bone will provide you with a list of the categories of personal information disclosed and a list of the names and addresses of the third parties. To make such a request, please write us at privacy@rag-bone.com.
Privacy Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Whenever we make a change, we will post the updated policy at this Web site and we encourage you to check our policy periodically. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy that would lessen your privacy rights, we will either continue to honor our prior policy for information that we collected when it was in force, or we will ask for your consent to the change. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@rag-bone.com or write to us at the following address:
