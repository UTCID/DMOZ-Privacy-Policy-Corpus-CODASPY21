Several of the foreign-policy hands most likely to join a Biden administration have been "consistently wrong" in their prognostications about the Trump administration’s global diplomacy, including their predictions that Trump's hardline policies would ignite war in the Middle East and make Israel less safe, a new report says.The Democratic Alliance Initiative, a new conservative foreign-policy group, recently issued an investigation into leading liberal voices who are likely to play a central role in a Biden administration.

Obama's Secretary of Defense said publicly that Joe Biden has been wrong on every foreign policy issue over the last 30 years.
Joe is not improving with age.

Hah! The Inverse Oracle of Delphi. Maybe Corrigan's running buddy. Dear Media, your parrot is not only dead, but most assuredly politically absent from the mortal coil of independent rational thought.

Affirmative Action policy advisors gets you what any normal, sane person would expect.
Someone who was advanced for their skin color or sex or both are likely to be less competent, even totally incompetent, since their advancement had nothing to do with competence.
Susan Rice and Samantha Powers are incompetent and they lie continuously, too.
They are political apparatchiks, and have been always wrong, pretty much all the time.
Reason number 2,494 why electing Biden would be a almost unimaginably bad thing to do.

Steve Mnuchin and the GOP are said to be open to talks on the Democrats' new $2.2trillion COVID package that includes a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks, $600 in extra unemployment and $225billion for schools. The scaled back, last ditch proposal represents a cutback from a $3.4 billion bill that passed the House in May, but remains well above what Senate Republicans had been willing to accept. Republicans have endorsed staying in the $650 billion to $1 trillion range. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her fellow Democrats Monday that the proposal will 'protect lives, livelihoods, and the life of our democracy over the coming months'.

With just over one month left until Americans decide whether we get to experience four more raucous years of Donald Trump, The New York Times released what has been presented by the mainstream media as a “bombshell” report on the real estate mogul’s tax documents — documents Trump says are “illegally obtained” (which the Times denies) and his lawyers say are incomplete, inaccurate and misleading. The Times’ conveniently-timed report, which runs some 10,000 words, has inspired a flood of media coverage citing the supposedly “damning” revelations contained within.But if you look closer at those 10,000 words, something is conspicuously missing.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired photos on Monday night that allegedly show Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) not wearing a mask while at an airport, which Carlson claims came after she wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration demanding that “all airport and airline employees and passengers” wear masks.Carlson began the segment by showing a news report from June in which a reporter states: “More and more lawmakers are calling for nationwide rule on wearing face coverings. Senator Dianne Feinstein has written to federal agencies asking for a mandatory mask policy both in the air and on public transit.”

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Breitbart News exclusively that the New York Times piece on President Donald Trump’s taxes represents “liberal media” in an attempt to “desperately” engage in a “smear” of the president ahead of the election. The Times claimed that Trump only paid $750 in taxes in a piece over the weekend, but McEnany said this hit piece will not convince voters to turn on Trump, because the public sees Trump donating his entire $400,000 annual salary as president back to the government every quarter and that he has “sacrifice[d]” his successful business career to serve as president.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), asked to react to Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s (D-Mich.) claim that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be a vote against Obamacare, told “Fox News Sunday” that the Democrats think the Supreme Court should be a mini Congress, “politicians without robes” who “don’t even need to hear cases.“Senator Stabenow is my colleague, and I consider Debbie a friend, so I say this gently, sell crazy somewhere else, we're all stocked up here. Unless Debbie is clairvoyant, I don't think she knows how the nominee is going to vote or any other member of the United States Supreme Court,” Kennedy said. (Video)

Moscow– Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that the United States and Russia strike a deal prohibiting both countries from interfering in each other’s elections. In a statement, Putin argued that Washington and Moscow should “exchange guarantees of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, including electoral processes, including using [information and communication technologies] and high-tech methods.” The Russian leader also suggested that the two countries reestablish regular interagency dialogue on cyber-security and develop a cyber equivalent to the 1972 U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea agreement,

That CNN treats the Biden campaign with kid gloves by routinely “asking” biased questions to senior spokespeople, advisors, and Biden himself is not a new development. But watching them allow the terms of an interview to be dictated to them as cameras roll for all to see is something else entirely. On Sunday, “State of the Union” host Jake Tapper interviewed the Democratic presidential nominee’s wife Jill Biden. As expected, softball after softball was thrown, with Tapper at times coming off as a campaign spokesman himself. For example, he framed a question about the upcoming debate between Biden and President Trump like this: Your husband is an experienced debater.

The wife of Donald Trump's demoted campaign boss Brad Parscale fled screaming into the street in just her bikini - before telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself', DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal. Police raced to Parscale's Fort Lauderdale, Florida home Sunday afternoon after the Good Samaritan bundled Candice Parscale into her car and dialed 911. As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'.

Two thousand people in California's Napa Valley wine growing area have been ordered to evacuate their homes, and another 3,000 have been told to prepare to, amid rapidly-spreading wildfires which have destroyed at least one winery.Chateau Boswell, a 40-year-old family-run winery near St Helena, was on fire on Sunday night, as firefighters desperately tried to put out the blaze. Napa County Office of Emergency Services said 64 wineries sit within the evacuation or evacuation warning areas, along with rural estates and remote, unincorporated communities.High winds, gusting at 55mph, were hampering attempts to put out the Glass Fire, which broke out at 3:50am on Sunday and has so far

Is anyone really surprised that Donald Trump’s tax affairs are opaque? Or that he is not as rich as he claims? Is it really all that horrifying that he has for years claimed business losses in order to offset his significant income tax liability? Does it appall us that the Trump family used a Delaware-based consulting group to pay themselves?
Of course not.
The New York Times’s big Trump tax files splash on Sunday is therefore something of a flop. It is well-timed — an election is fast-approaching and the story might give Biden a good attack line in the big TV debate on Tuesday night.

During remarks on Sunday, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused Republicans of engaging in an “abuse of power” for moving forward to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before election day, emphasizing that early voting has already started in some states.“U.S. Constitution provides one chance — one — for the Americans to have their voices heard on who serves a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, who makes those big decisions about their healthcare, their civil rights, and much else,” said Biden.“That chance is now.

More than two-thirds of Britons believe that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should have their titles taken away from them after they stepped down from royal life, a new survey suggests.
The study for Tatler magazine also showed that the majority of participants believe Meghan Markle, who is an American citizen, should not be commenting on US politics.
The poll, which was gathered last month by research consultancy Savanta Comres, polled 4,174 British adults and only included results from those who expressed an opinion when questioned.

Jill Biden, wife of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, waved off a question about her husband’s frequent gaffes from CNN’s Jake Tapper during a segment Monday, informing him he “can’t go there.”“Your husband has been known to make the occasional gaffe,” Tapper began, before being cut off. (Video) “Oh, you cannot even go there,” Jill Biden responded, as Tapper chuckled. “After Donald Trump you cannot even say the word ‘gaffe.’” (Tweet/Video) “Well, that’s what I wanted…I can’t even say the word ‘gaffe’?” Tapper responded.“Nope. Done. It’s gone,” Jill Biden interjected. “The gaffe issue is over,” Tapper pressed.“Over. So over,” Jill Biden declared.

Apparently, nothing is sacred with Meghan Markle and her man-on-the-string, Prince Harry.
After telling us how privacy-obsessed they were, with Harry weeping sob stories about his mom and the papparazzi, and even suing some media companies for their intrusions, as well as leaving their high-vis rented mansion in the Hollywood Hills for more sedate (but pricier) Montecito, they've now decided to go full frontal, back for the cameras, making themselves the stars of some reality TV. No kidding, it's a project with Netflix cameras following them around. Seems they like themselves those cameras.

The release of a joint report by the Senate committees on homeland security and finance raised important questions about obviously unethical foreign profiteering by members of the Biden family.
In particular, former Vice President Joe Biden’s ne’er-do-well son Hunter received a remarkable amount of money from highly suspect foreign entities, including ones controlled by the Chinese government. On at least one occasion, the elder Biden appears to have directly facilitated his son’s tawdry dealings. On another, the current Democratic presidential nominee ignored an obvious appearance of a conflict of interest that compromised the moral authority of U.S. diplomacy.

The New York Times is undoubtedly pleased that it published more than two decades’ worth of Donald Trump’s tax returns. The self-congratulations are premature. The Times’ article reveals that Trump was telling the truth all along about his audit. We can also see that Obama’s policies benefitted rich people. Finally, because the policies show how our complicated progressive tax system will always benefit rich people with good accountants, the Times unwittingly advanced the argument for a flat tax.

Rejecting concerns from doctors and parents, Gov. Gavin Newsom celebrated the signing of a bill that allows gender clinics to provide transgender drugs and surgery known to sterilize children and adults. Newsom praised the new law for “strengthening protections for LGBTQ+ Californians” and providing an “additional step forward” in “our march towards equality,” in an announcement over the weekend. “Governor Newsom is ignoring the heartbreak his policies will unleash,” said Jonathan Keller, President of California Family Council. “AB 2218 opens the door to drugs and surgeries causing irreversible damage, risking life-long sterility for young people.”

It was two weeks before anyone spoke of the hay bales.
This was odd, said Rachel Rowland, of Flint Hill, Va. — because the locals had certainly seen them: The display is 170 feet wide. Wrapped in glinting white plastic, the bales are stacked atop a rolling mountain hillside along Route 211, relaying their message to any nearby resident who drives to the closest grocery store.
“Farmers for Trump 2020,” the bales say, hand-painted with red and blue capital letters. “Keep America Great.”

Lydon, 64, has long been associated with anarchist views and he's managed to get people talking again.
A tweet showing the "God Save the Queen" singer wearing a pro-Donald Trump 'Make America Great Again' T-shirt has gone viral on Twitter this week, with one former fan decrying his idol's political views.
