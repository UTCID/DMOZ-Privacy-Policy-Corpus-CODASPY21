Children's Guidelines
We care about children and understand that they have
special privacy needs.
Therefore, we have adopted the following
privacy policy regarding children:
We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties
personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental
consent.
We will NOT give the child access to unmonitored chat
rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services that would
give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute
personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental
consent
When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we
will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time
basis and not use that information to re-contact the
child for other purposes.
Request the name or online contact information of a
parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental
consent or providing parental notification.
Respond more than once directly to a specific request
from a child (such as in the case where a child requests
a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the
child for other purposes.
We will use our best efforts
to provide parental notification, which will include the
nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the
parent to prevent the use of the information and
participation in the activity.
We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than
is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
We will provide the parent a description of the specific
types of a personally identifiable information collected from
their child upon request.
We will allow the parent to refuse
further use or future online collection of personally
identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to
obtain any personally identifiable information collected from
their child.
We will provide notice to children in age appropriate
terms of what personally identifiable information is to be
collected.
We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are
unsuitable for children.
We will encourage children to get their parent's
permission before sharing personal information online.
