For increased security, we encourage you to not include any personal information about yourself or others in Interactive Areas, such as name, phone number, email or street address. You should always use a screen name or other alias (other than your real name) to identify yourself in any public or Interactive Areas.
AMC, its Affiliates and any content providers that conduct, operate and/or manage Interactive Areas will not be responsible or liable for the actions or postings of any visitors or third parties with respect to any information, materials or content posted, uploaded or transmitted in Interactive Areas.
