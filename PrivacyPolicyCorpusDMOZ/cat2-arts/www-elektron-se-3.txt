Terms and Conditions
These terms are subject to change and Elektron will inform you of the updates each time your acceptance of them is required. Please make sure to read the below in its entirety.
Payment
VISA/Mastercard or PayPal are all acceptable methods of payment. Elektron uses services from DIBS Payment Services and Euroline for credit card payments. The credit card details are transferred using a secure SSL-connection. We support up to 256-bits encryption and guarantee that the process is secure. If no money has reached our account within 20 days, the order will be terminated. All goods remain the property of Elektron until paid for in full.
Prices for countries which are a part of the European Community include Swedish VAT as required by law. Orders outside the European Community do not have any sales tax added.
For us to be able to process card payments, please note your card needs to be connected to Verified by VISA (for VISA cards) or SecureCode (Mastercard).
Shipment
Direct orders are normally shipped the same business day we receive the payment, given we receive the payment before 12:00 CET. If the payment is received during a public holiday we will try to ship the order the first business day after the holiday. With online credit card payment, the transaction is instant. We reserve the right to delay shipments a few days due to unexpected inconveniences, unexpected stock shortages or heavy workload. If the order contains pre-order items, the order will be shipped when all items are in stock.
We ship all orders using UPS. This guarantees the quickest and safest possible delivery. Shipping within Europe is 1-4 business days, to North America 1-2 business days and to the rest of the world generally between 2-6 business days. When the order is shipped we will send you the tracking number by e-mail. It is also possible to log in to your Customer Account to access the tracking number.
The tax authorities of countries outside the EU sometimes add sales/import tax. If you are unsure of the regulations for your country, please check with the relevant public authority. We write the following customs commodity code on our synthesizer shipments: 9207105000.
For orders from the USA all import taxes and duties are included in the price. No extra taxes should be charged by the US tax authorities.
Warranty
Elektron machines bought 2010-07-05 and later come with a three-year limited warranty, starting from the date of the original purchase. Being able to prove the date of the original purchase with an invoice or a receipt is necessary if you require warranty service.

Warranty disclaimer
Elektron’s warranty for products and, if applicable, software as described in Elektron’s End User License Agreement for Software (“EULA”) (the EULA covers Elektron software/firmware accompanying or is installed on the product) shall not apply if the product (i) has been altered/opened, repaired/attempted to be repaired or reversed engineered in any way, except by Elektron or an authorized representative/repair center of Elektron, (ii) has not been installed, operated, repaired or maintained in accordance with Elektron’s recommendations, instructions and/or the product’s user manual, (iii) on which the serial number has been defaced, modified or removed, (iv) has been subjected to unusual levels of physical or electrical stress, abnormal environmental conditions (including but not limited to deterioration due to perspiration, corrosive atmosphere or other external causes such as extremes in temperature or humidity), misuse, negligence, or accident, or (v) damages attributable to power line surge or related electrical abnormalities, lightning damage or Acts of God.
