TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Terms and Conditions :: Studio
Purchase Terms
Users may request a quote for a specific order through the website on alasaw.com/pages/alasaw. Unless noted otherwise prices may not include complete shipping charges, in-transit insurance, sales or other applicable taxes, duties, storage charges, local delivery, and/or installation. We refer to customers who place orders as “Buyers” or “Customers.”
Right to Accept or Reject Order
AlaSaw has the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any order. AlaSaw may accept any order by confirming the order, collecting a deposit for such order and/or sending an invoice to Buyer. No order is binding on AlaSaw unless accepted by AlaSaw as provided in these Terms. For the avoidance of any doubt, in the event of a conflict between the terms and specifications of a submitted order, these Terms or the terms on the invoice shall control.
Changes to Order
AlaSaw reserves the right to agree to or decline any requested changes by Buyer to any order. If AlaSaw agrees to make changes, the pricing of the goods ordered will be adjusted according to our pricing in place at the time the changes are requested. Approved changes to an order may be subject, in addition to an increase in the price of the goods, to change, cancellation or re-stocking fees. Please note that changes to an order may require adjustment to the quoted lead time.
Payment
After a quote and rough drawing are approved, a 50% deposit is required to reserve a place for your project on the schedule, initiate final shop drawings and start production on made-to-order items. The balance is required for pick-up by customer or delivery by a service.
We accept cash, checks and credit cards. All invoices are COD, unless other arrangements are made. In the case of terms granted, late invoices will accumulate 1% interest per month. for any invoices not paid within thirty (30) days from the date such payment is due. AlaSaw also reserves the right to recover any and all collection costs for late or unpaid invoices, including its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.
Purchase orders are considered an actual order. All cancellations must be received in writing within 7 days of purchase or are subject to a 20% cancellation fee.
Remedies Upon Default
If Buyer fails to make payment in accordance with the terms herein or otherwise fails to comply with any provision hereof, AlaSaw may, at its option, cancel any unshipped portion of an order, retain the goods and declare a forfeiture of the deposit as liquidated damages. AlaSaw shall also (in addition to other remedies available) have the right to appropriate and sell the goods and apply the amounts collected to any payment due to AlaSaw, and/or the payment of any expenses and costs to exercise AlaSaw's rights hereunder, as AlaSaw shall determine in its sole discretion. Buyer will remain liable for the balance of all unpaid orders.
Sales Tax
If applicable, we collect sales tax from buyers in Alabama. We accept valid sales tax licenses.
Lead Time
Lead Time on studio orders is generally 8-12 weeks, plus shipping time. Ship dates are estimated and not guaranteed.
Appearance Variability
Every product Alasaw delivers is made from urban timber, whether it’s from your tree or our inventory. You will have a hard time finding any wood which comes close to matching Alasaw’s uniqueness, character and overall quality. You should not expect your furniture to show the uniformity of man-made materials or even farmed wood. Alasaw furniture is handmade and therefore may have slight variances in overall dimensions. Over time, the finish will change, and wood may move. This is a natural characteristic of wood. Wood is a natural material, inherently inconsistent and affected by its environment. Urban timber offers even more character and with that, variability. The appearance of the end product may vary from samples. No guarantee is made to the exact color, appearance or final finish to wood. Wood may contain mineral deposits, pin holes, knots, color differences, unusual grain patterns, contrasting heart and sapwood, etc. Features vary from tree to tree and slab to slab.
Finish
We use hand-applied, oil finishes. They are non-toxic, bring out depth and color, and condition the wood. It takes the finish up to one year for an oil finish to fully cure. Surfaces finishes are optional.
Care
No finish can withstand prolonged exposure to water, food, sun or other substances. All spills on the wood must be removed immediately with a dry cloth. Oil finishes can be wiped clean with a damp rag and refreshed with beeswax.
You can help protect your furniture by not placing furniture in direct sunlight and avoiding extreme temperatures, harsh cleaners, candle wax, oils or ink. AlaSaw does not cover damages or defects caused by use of chemical treatments, cleaning products or protective coatings applied by the Buyer. Any such chemical treatments, cleaning products or protective coatings void all warranties of AlaSaw.
Delivery
Freight/delivery fees will be the sole responsibility of the customer, dealer or designer.
Our primary shipping method is “Blanket-Wrap”. All orders are shipped “Freight Collect”, which means that AlaSaw’s responsibility for loss or damage in transit ceases upon release of merchandise in good order to the transportation company. This means that delivery of the goods to a carrier for delivery to Buyer shall be deemed to constitute delivery to Buyer and thereupon title to such goods, and risk of loss or damage, shall be Buyer’s. Buyer shall inspect the goods upon delivery and notify AlaSaw within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt if any goods are damaged or incomplete. Buyer will be deemed to have accepted the goods unless Buyer notifies AlaSaw in writing of any damaged or incomplete good during the 24-hour inspection period and furnishes such written evidence or other documentation as required by AlaSaw. After the inspection period, all goods will be deemed accepted, except as such notice in writing has been timely given. Acceptance by Buyer and/or its agent of any goods shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of any default of claims for damages on account of such goods. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE BUYER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF DAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE GOODS WHICH BUYER HAS ACCEPTED DELIVERY.
Merchandise that is refused at the time delivery, will be returned to Alasaw for inspection to determine freight or manufacturing damage.
Alasaw is not liable for delays or failure to ship goods due to any causes beyond our control.
The customer is responsible for knowing that the site will permit normal delivery.
Size
In no event shall a mistake in size or fit of the goods, due to Buyer error, result in invalidation of any order or require any refund.
10-Year Warranty
Any furniture manufactured by Alasaw is covered under a manufacturer’s 10 Year Limited Warranty, extending for 10 years from the date of final payment or delivery. Alasaw will in its sole discretion determine the appropriate repair process and pay reasonable and customary labor rates to repair or replace the defective parts and shipping costs from Buyer to Alasaw, or a repair center designated by Alasaw. If the proposal by Alasaw is not accepted by the Buyer, the Buyer will be responsible for all repairs costs and the warranty becomes void. After 10 years from the date of purchase, the original Buyer will be responsible for labor, packing, and all shipping and transportation costs.
Limitations and Exceptions to Warranty
This Limited Warranty provides coverage to the original Buyer only. It does not apply to merchandise that was, at any time, used as a floor sample or display model, any merchandise purchased “as is” or second- hand, any merchandise purchased at a distress sale or a going-out-of-business sale, or any merchandise purchased from a liquidator, or used as rental furniture or in a rental or hospitality space. All warranties, whether express or implied, cover only normal usage. No warranty, express or implied, applies to any condition resulting from misuse, abuse, delivery or transportation damage, nor any condition resulting from incorrect or inadequate maintenance, cleaning or care. Warranty is null and void if furniture has been moved from Buyer’s original point of delivery or altered by any person, dealer, or company in any way.
Alasaw does not provide any warranty with regard to Customer’s Own Material (COM/COL), including their logs converted into urban timber and other customer-supplied items.
Alasaw shall not be liable under any extended or additional warranties offered by any retailer or through a third-party.
EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, ANY AND ALL GOODS AND/OR SERVICES FROM ALASAW ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL ALASAW, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH BUYER’S HANDLING, USE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE WITH RESPECT TO ANY GOODS OR SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH ALASAW, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. FURTHER, IN NO EVENT SHALL ALASAW, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER AMOUNTS FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER IN EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE GOODS ORDERED BY BUYER OR ITS AGENT. ANY CLAIM BY BUYER OR ITS AGENT WITH REFERENCE TO ANY GOODS SOLD SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED BY BUYER AND/OR ITS AGENT UNLESS SUBMITTED TO ALASAW, AS APPLICABLE, IN WRITING, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE BUYER AND/OR ITS AGENT DISCOVERED, OR SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED, ANY CLAIMED BREACH.
Safety
It is up to the customer to secure furniture as needed. Alasaw is not responsible if the customer does not use fasteners as code or safety sense requires.
Indemnification
Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless AlaSaw and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns and its respective directors, officers, shareholders and employees, (collectively, "Indemnitees") against any and all loss, injury, death, damage, liability, claim, deficiency, action, judgment, interest, award, penalty, fine, cost or expense, including reasonable attorney and professional fees and costs, and the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or occurring in connection with the Buyer's use of the goods; Buyer's negligence, willful misconduct or breach of the Terms; or arising out of or relating to Buyer’s violation of these Terms.
Waiver and Severability
No waiver by AlaSaw of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of AlaSaw to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
Force Majeure
AlaSaw shall not be liable for any delays in, inability to complete, or other default in any order for any reason or cause beyond AlaSaw’s reasonable control, including but not limited to (a) government action, war, riots, civil commotion, embargoes or martial laws, (b) AlaSaw inability to obtain necessary materials from its usual sources of supply, (c) shortage of labor, raw material, production or transportation facilities or other delays in transit, (d) labor difficulty involving AlaSaw, a manufacturer or others, (e) fire, flood or other casualty, or (f) other contingencies of manufacture or shipment. In the event of any delay in AlaSaw’s performance due, in whole or in part, to any cause beyond AlaSaw’s reasonable control, AlaSaw shall have such additional time for performance as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Buyer's acceptance of any goods shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of any claim for damages on account of any delay in delivery of such goods.
Governing Law and Jurisdiction
All matters arising out of or relating to an order or these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Alabama or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Alabama. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts. All disputes shall be filed with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Birmingham, Alabama and governed by the rules of the AAA. All decisions made in the arbitration shall be binding and an entry of judgment shall be deemed to the prevailing party. Any judgment rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Attorney fees and related costs shall be awarded to the prevailing party.

Right to Accept or Reject Order
AlaSaw has the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any order. AlaSaw may accept any order by confirming the order, collecting a deposit for such order and/or sending an invoice to Buyer. No order is binding on AlaSaw unless accepted by AlaSaw as provided in these Terms. For the avoidance of any doubt, in the event of a conflict between the terms and specifications of a submitted order, these Terms or the terms on the invoice shall control.
Changes to Order
AlaSaw reserves the right to agree to or decline any requested changes by Buyer to any order. If AlaSaw agrees to make changes, the pricing of the goods ordered will be adjusted according to our pricing in place at the time the changes are requested. Approved changes to an order may be subject, in addition to an increase in the price of the goods, to change, cancellation or re-stocking fees. Please note that changes to an order may require adjustment to the quoted lead time.
Lead Time
We try to give accurate timeframes at the estimate stage. However, lumber dries as nature allows and kiln schedules may affect timelines. Orders may not be cancelled, nor deposits refunded, due to timing for wood to dry. For hardwoods, allow about 12-18 months from the felling of the tree to the finished product.
Storage / Delays
Delays to milling a fallen log can be a detriment to wood quality, and create space issues. Logs that remain uncut longer than 20 working days as a result of awaiting direction or communication from the customer will be become the property of AlaSaw. Payment for milling is required before we can cut your wood. There is no charge for a kiln schedule or the naturally slow speed of drying causing a delay. Wood that has been milled and dried and is left without direction from the buyer for 90 days or longer will become the property of AlaSaw, regardless whether the wood has been paid for or not by the buyer.
Installation / On Site
We do not install products or finish wood on site.
Quality and Variability
We explain the characteristics of the wood as we understand them, but you decide how and where to use it. Urban timber is milled and sold as-is, with no warranties express or implied to the fitness of the products for a particular use or location. Samples, photos and sources of information may be provided to help you, but AlaSaw may not capture all potential implications. AlaSaw can estimate likely yield or waste factors from our processing and in your application, but we cannot guarantee such factors with precision. In the case of a short yield, we can supplement a short yield with our inventory at comparable cost, plus the price of the wood. Wood is a natural material. It is inherently inconsistent and affected by its environment. Urban timber offers even more character, and with that, variability. The appearance of the end product may vary from the examples shown. No representation, warranty and/or guarantee is made to the exact color, appearance or final finish to the wood. Wood may contain mineral deposits, pin holes, knots, color differences, unusual grain wood patterns, contrasting heart and sapwood, etc. Features vary from tree to tree and slab to slab.

After the inspection period, all goods will be deemed accepted, except as such notice in writing has been timely given. Acceptance by Buyer and/or its agent of any goods shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of any default of claims for damages on account of such goods. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE BUYER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF DAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE GOODS WHICH BUYER HAS ACCEPTED DELIVERY. Merchandise that is refused at the time delivery will be returned to AlaSaw for inspection to determine freight or manufacturing damage. AlaSaw is not liable for delays or failure to ship goods due to any causes beyond our control. The customer is responsible for knowing that the site will permit normal delivery.

Returns
Anything customized products, i.e., cut to specific dimensions, cannot be returned or cancelled, including a customer’s tree. Customer wood that has been milled and dried is not returnable or refundable. Purchases directly from our inventory have a 10-day period for returns, as long as they are in exact purchase condition. Returns are at the customer’s expense and must be insured for the full purchase value. Once we receive the returned items and verify that it has not been damaged or altered, a 20% re-stocking fee will be charged. Credits or refunds will be issued to the customer to whom AlaSaw sold the product. AlaSaw has no contractual relationship with or obligation to any other parties.
Payment
To start work, we will bill for the estimated milling cost, based on the Doyle Scale projected yield of the tree. Depending on the scope, an additional billing may be requested to kiln dry the lumber into architectural elements or furniture. The balance is required for pick-up by customer (or delivery service) of completed project. We accept cash, checks and credit cards. All invoices are COD, unless other arrangements are made. If terms are granted, late or unpaid invoices will accumulate 1% interest per month for any invoices not paid within thirty (30) days from the date such payment is due. AlaSaw also reserves the right to recover any and all collection costs for late or unpaid invoices, including its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.
Remedies Upon Default
If Buyer fails to make payment in accordance with the terms herein or otherwise fails to comply with any provision hereof, AlaSaw may, at its option, cancel any unshipped portion of an order, retain the goods and declare a forfeiture of the deposit as liquidated damages. AlaSaw shall also (in addition to other remedies available) have the right to appropriate and sell the goods and apply the amounts collected to any payment due to AlaSaw, and/or the payment of any expenses and costs to exercise AlaSaw's rights hereunder, as AlaSaw shall determine in its sole discretion. Buyer will remain liable for the balance of all unpaid orders.
