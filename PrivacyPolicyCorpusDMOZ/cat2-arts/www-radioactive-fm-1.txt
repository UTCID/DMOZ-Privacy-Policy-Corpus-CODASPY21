Privacy Policy
1. Our Privacy Policy
We respect the privacy of all of the users and suppliers who use the RadioActive.FM app. We are committed to all customers to protect their personal information. Our privacy policy is based on the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy act 1993. This privacy policy applies to all users and suppliers in relation to our service.

Using the RadioActive.FM app requires users to sign up for the RadioActive.FM loyalty scheme. We collect users’ names, email addresses, gender and date of birth.
User information will be made available to our suppliers (Listed in the app under Chosen Few and Associated Discounters) as anonymous demographic information.
Users will be sent our monthly email newsletter, which always includes the option to unsubscribe.
The QR code scanning system collects information about which users are using which discounts and when. This information will be used for the continuing improvement of our service to identify the offers and suppliers that are most popular with our users.
On occasion our premium suppliers (Or Chosen Few) can request information about top users of their discounts, so that these users can be rewarded with exclusive prizes and offers. These will be communicated using the app’s push notification system and can be redeemed using the QR code scanning system.
We will not use or disclose your personal information in any way, other than in accordance with this policy, the terms referred to above or the privacy act 1993.
