Cookies may be disabled by adjusting the setting of your browser, or by installing tools like Google’s

We do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use our website.
All information is collected solely for the College’s internal use. We use it to track and evaluate traffic trends so that we can continually improve the quality our website. We also might use this information to inform you of changes to MHC-owned and -affiliated websites or to provide you with other news and information about the site that we believe may be of interest to you.
User information is neither shared nor sold to unaffiliated third parties for commercial use unless 1) you give us express consent; or 2) we are required to disclose it in compliance with state or federal laws.
