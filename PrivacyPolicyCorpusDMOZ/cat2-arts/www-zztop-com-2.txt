Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial and contact information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services and may be shared with companies that help us operate our site, such as the credit card companies that we use.

We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company and about companies we choose.

BubbleUp provides online ticketing to venues and artists in which we ask customers for contact information (e-mail address and mailing and billing addresses).

In addition, BubbleUp collects and stores statistics and other information about the online activities of our users on an aggregated (collected) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts.
