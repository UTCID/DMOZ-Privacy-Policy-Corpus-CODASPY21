If you decide to access any third party site, you do so entirely at your own risk, and you may be exposed to offensive, indecent or objectionable content. StageAgent shall have no liability for any loss or damage arising from your use of any such sites.
6.Copyright Notices/Complaints
StageAgent takes claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any materials accessible on or from the Sites infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from the Sites by submitting written notification to our Copyright Agent (designated below). In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) ("DMCA"), the written notice (the "DMCA Notice") must include substantially the following:
Your physical or electronic signature.
Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on the Sites, a representative list of such works.
Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.
Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate.
A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
Our designated Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Notices is:
Estage Enterprises, Inc.
327 Fuller Street
Redwood City, CA 94063
Phone: 408.782.4307
legal@stageagent.com
If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective. Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Sites is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.
If you believe that material you posted on the Sites was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a "Counter-Notice") by submitting written notification to our copyright agent (identified below). Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:
Your physical or electronic signature.
An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.
Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).
A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which the Sites may be found) and that you will accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who provided the Sites with the complaint at issue.
Completed Counter-Notices should be sent to:
Estage Enterprises, Inc.
327 Fuller Street
Redwood City, CA 94036
Phone: 408.782.4307
legal@stageagent.com
The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your Counter-Notice. Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Sites was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.
It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.
7. Right of Publicity
Please be aware that celebrities, and sometimes others, may have a "right of publicity," which means that they may have a right to control commercial uses of their name, image, likeness, and other aspects of their identity. Although you may be a fan, you risk infringing celebrity rights if you use a celebrity name or likeness on the Sites and you don't have the celebrity's permission. StageAgent reserves the right to remove any content contained in or posted to the Sites that StageAgent determines in its sole discretion does or may allegedly infringe another person’s copyright, trademark, celebrity material or other rights.
Notices to StageAgent regarding any alleged infringement on the Sites should be directed to StageAgent's General Counsel's Office at legal@stageagent.com.
8. User Accounts

As part of the registration process, you will select a password and be asked to submit, among other things, your email address. You agree that all information you provide to StageAgent for purposes of creating an account will be true, accurate, current and complete and your failure to provide such information will constitute a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in the immediate termination of your account.
Each user name permits one person to access the password-protected portion of the Sites (including the Paid Services), and you shall not share the user name and password with any third party. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password and you agree you will not sell, transfer or assign your user account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer so that others may not access any password-protected portion of the Sites (including the Paid Services) using your name, user name or password in whole or in part.
You agree that any unauthorized use or misuse of the Sites (or any content derived therefrom) by you or by anyone using your user name or password may result in immediate suspension or termination of your user account by StageAgent, in its sole and absolute discretion, without refund of any pre-paid fees. StageAgent reserves the right to terminate your access to and use of the Sites in the event that you provide any false information to StageAgent as part of the subscription process, without refund of any pre-paid fees. In the event of such termination, you will continue to be liable for applicable fees for the period prior to termination, together with such other remedies as to which StageAgent may be entitled.
9. User Provided Content
Portions of the Sites may allow you to post, upload or transmit information. Anything you submit, post or otherwise contribute to the Sites (“User Provided Content”) becomes the property of StageAgent and may be used with or without your consent. User Provided Content includes, but is not limited to data, text, images, software, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, educational materials, quizzes, exams, polls, surveys, or other materials to or through the Sites. For example, the Sites may offer the ability for users to participate in forums, wikis, chat rooms, blogs; create talent profiles; upload images, reviews, commentary, analysis, lesson plans, performance announcements; create bulletin boards, quizzes or exams; or participate in other interactive areas, and any submissions to or through such features on the Sites shall be construed as User Provided Content.

By submitting User Provided Content, you represent, acknowledge, and warrant (a) that you have the right to do so or that you have obtained any necessary third party consents (e.g., under privacy or intellectual property laws), (b) that the User Provided Content does not infringe on the copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, rights of privacy or publicity, or the intellectual property rights of any person or entity, and (c) that no other party has any right, title, claim, or interest in the User Provided Content that would be infringed upon as a result of uploading the User Provided Content. Upon the request of StageAgent, you agree to furnish StageAgent, with any documentation, substantiation and releases necessary and reasonably required to verify and substantiate your compliance with this provision.
StageAgent, cannot vouch for the validity, accuracy or credibility of any User Provided Content, and does not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions Users may take as a result of viewing, reading or listening to User Provided Content on the Sites. Through your use of the Sites you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false pretenses, international trade issues and foreign nationals. StageAgent does not endorse any User Provided Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein. By using the Sites, you assume all associated risks, and StageAgent expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Provided Content.
In addition, you grant to StageAgent, without any credit or compensation to you, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, unrestricted, irrevocable, and fully transferable, assignable and sub-licensable license to host, use, modify, display, copy, reproduce, disclose, sell, translate, create derivative works of, distribute, and export any User Provided Content, in whole or in part, or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now known or hereafter developed or discovered for any purposes whatsoever. You agree that StageAgent may publish or otherwise disclose your name in connection with your User Provided Content.
StageAgent has no obligation to pre-screen User Provided Content, but reserves the right to monitor any information transmitted or received through the Sites. You acknowledge, consent and agree that StageAgent, at its sole discretion and without notice to you, may review, censor, delete, move, edit, block access to or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any User Provided Content or other information, in whole or in part, that StageAgent deems obscene, defamatory or libelous in nature, that invades the right of privacy or infringes any right of any person or entity, is unlawful, is offensive or otherwise inappropriate, or that StageAgent believes to be in violation of these Terms of Use.
Under no circumstances will StageAgent be liable to you in any way for any User Provided Content that you upload, post, or otherwise make available via the Sites including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in User Provided Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of User Provided Content. In addition, you hereby release StageAgent from any and all claims, liens, demands, actions or suits in connection with the User Provided Content, including, without limitation, any and all liability for any use or nonuse of your User Provided Content, claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, right of publicity, emotional distress or economic loss.
10. Subscription Terms, Fees and Payments; Automatic Renewal & Cancellation.
(a) Billing Terms Applicable to Both StageAgent.com and StageAgent.org. The following payment terms apply to all subscriptions offered and sold by StageAgent.com and StageAgent.org:
**
(i) Payment & Billing.** When you initially subscribe to the Paid Services, your credit or debit card will be charged immediately for the initial term of the subscription at the then-current fee for the applicable subscription period.
You will be charged in advance for the renewal term of the subscription service (or initial term, in the case of a renewal following the expiration of an applicable free trial) on your applicable billing date (the "Billing Date"), which will be the corresponding monthly, quarterly or annual anniversary of the activation date of your subscription. If, however, the activation date of your subscription (or, as applicable, your free trial) is on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of a month, and your Billing Date does not exist in a particular month because there are fewer than thirty-one (31) days in the month payment is due, your Billing Date for that particular renewal (or initial term, in the case of a renewal following the expiration of an applicable free trial) will be on the last day of the month in which your Billing Date would otherwise be. Each charge on the applicable Billing Date applies to the subscription period immediately following the Billing Date (e.g., a charge for a monthly subscription applies to the month immediately following the Billing Date). You understand that any applicable sales or use taxes will be payable by you, and may be included in each periodic statement.
StageAgent may, in its sole discretion, suspend access to your account or deactivate your account without notice to you if StageAgent is unable to process your payment or if payment is past due, regardless of the amount. You agree to pay any outstanding balance in full within thirty (30) days of cancellation or termination of your subscription. You may update any of your billing information (including a change to your desired billing payment method) through your account settings on StageAgent.com or StageAgent.org.
All fees and charges incurred in connection with your user name(s) and password(s) will be billed to the credit or debit card you designate during the registration process. If you want to designate a different credit or debit card or there is a change in your credit or debit card validity or expiration date, you must update your information through your account settings on StageAgent.com or StageAgent.org.
(ii) Notice of Automatic Renewal. All of the subscriptions offered through the Sites renew automatically. This means that once you become a subscriber, your subscription will automatically renew and your credit or debit card will be charged based on the subscription program (annually, quarterly, or monthly) you have chosen unless you opt out or cancel by following the instructions in these Terms of Use. By subscribing to the Paid Services, you authorize StageAgent to charge the applicable recurring subscription fees to your credit or debit card.
BY COMPLETING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE PAID SERVICES:
YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE PAID SERVICES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD;
YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BILLED AT THE START OF EACH NEW SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD; AND
THAT PERIODIC CHARGES FOR EACH NEW SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY BILLED TO YOUR DESIGNATED BILLING PAYMENT METHOD.
(iii) Unauthorized Charges. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU, AND NOT STAGEAGENT, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.
(iv) Billing Discrepancies. Unless you notify StageAgent of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your payment statement, they will be deemed accepted by you and you release StageAgent from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any such error or discrepancy.
(b) Additional Billing Terms Applicable to StageAgent.com Subscriptions. The following terms apply to subscriptions offered through StageAgent.com:
(i) Fees Subject to Change. From time to time, StageAgent may change the fees and charges then in effect by giving you notice prior to the changes going into effect. StageAgent will also post current fees online at https://stageagent.com/signup.
(ii) Cancellations. You may cancel your paid subscription on StageAgent.com at any time through your account settings page. Cancelling via your account settings will stop all future renewal charges and you will retain access to Paid Services until your subscription expires. Upon cancellation via your account settings, you should receive an email confirming your subscription cancellation. If you do not receive an email confirming your subscription cancellation, please email us at info@stageagent.com to ensure that your cancellation has been successfully processed.
You may also simply email your cancellation request to info@stageagent.com. For StageAgent.org subscriptions, see section C below for additional billing terms.
(iii) Refund Requests. Monthly subscriptions are not eligible for a refund during the billing month in which the cancellation request is submitted, but can be cancelled to prevent additional future monthly charges. For quarterly and yearly subscriptions you may cancel prior to renewal to prevent future renewal charges and you may also email a request to info@stageagent.com to cancel during the first five (5) days after renewal to be eligible for a full refund on the renewal payment. If the cancellation occurs after the cancellation window, or if the charge was for a monthly subscription renewal, you will not receive a refund. If you cancel your subscription but are not eligible for a refund, you will retain access to StageAgent.com until your subscription expires.
(c) Additional Billing Terms Applicable to StageAgent.org Subscriptions. The following terms apply to subscriptions offered through StageAgent.org:
(i) Free trials; Automatic Renewals. In some cases, we might offer a free trial to teachers using StageAgent for Schools on StageAgent.org. If you are a teacher who has been granted a free trial, you will be asked to authorize, and by accepting these Terms of Use, you hereby expressly authorize StageAgent to charge the applicable recurring subscription fees to your credit or debit card upon the expiration of the free trial. After the free trial is complete, you will be charged at the rate and schedule selected when you enrolled in the trial. Teachers using StageAgent.org may cancel their account online through the subscription settings at any time during the free trial period and incur no charge. Unless you notify StageAgent of your decision to terminate your subscription or, as applicable, your free trial, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription term or free trial (if applicable) at the then-current fee.
(ii) Cancellations. You may cancel your subscription in accordance with the terms of your institution’s license agreement or by contacting info@stageagent.com.
(iii) Refund Requests. Refund requests may be made by filing a customer support ticket at https://help.stageagent.org, or by emailing info@stageagent.com. Please include the full name and email address associated with the account. Your request must be received by end of business (5:00 p.m. Pacific Time) on the appropriate day as described above, or earlier. All refunds will be given to the original credit or debit card on which the purchase was made. Please allow a reasonable time for the refund to reach you or be charged back to your account.
11. Additional Terms
In some instances, additional terms or end user license agreements apply to some services, products, software, competitions or promotions offered via the Sites (“Additional Terms”).

(D) WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND STAGEAGENT AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. NEITHER YOU NOR STAGEAGENT WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.
18. Indemnity
You agree to and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless StageAgent, its affiliates and its and its affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, members, joint venturers, licensors, suppliers, vendors, distributors, advertisers and other contracting parties (“Affiliates”) from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses, including legal fees or demands of liability, including attorneys' fees and costs incurred by StageAgent and its Affiliates in connection with any claim by a third party (including an intellectual property claim) arising out of (i) materials and content you submit, post or transmit through the Sites, or (ii) use of the Sites by you in violation of these Terms of Use or in violation of any applicable law. Users further agree that they will cooperate as reasonably required in the defense of such claims. StageAgent and its Affiliates reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by users, and users shall not, in any event, settle any claim or matter without the written consent of StageAgent. Users further agree to hold harmless StageAgent and its Affiliates from any claim arising from a third party's use of information or materials of any kind that users post to the Sites.
19. Recovery of Fees
You agree that if StageAgent takes action (by itself or through its representatives) to enforce any of the provisions of these Terms of Use against you, including collection of any amounts due to StageAgent, StageAgent shall be entitled to recover from you (and you agree to pay), StageAgent's reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and any costs of any litigation, in addition to all sums to which StageAgent is entitled or any other relief, at law or in equity, except as otherwise limited herein or by law.
20. Severability
If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision shall be severed from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms.
21. Miscellaneous
(A) International Disclaimer. StageAgent controls and operates the Sites from its U.S.-based office(s), and makes no representation that the Sites are appropriate or available for use beyond the United States. If you use the Sites from other locations, you are doing so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content.
(B) Interpretation. The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law theory that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Wherever the word “including” is used in these Terms, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation.”
(C) Assignment. StageAgent may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of StageAgent.
(D) No Waiver. No failure or delay by StageAgent in exercising any of its rights, powers, or remedies will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy.
(E) No Oral Agreements or Modifications. There shall be no amendment or modification of these Terms of Use unless the same is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of StageAgent. Oral agreements shall expressly be non-binding and unenforceable.
