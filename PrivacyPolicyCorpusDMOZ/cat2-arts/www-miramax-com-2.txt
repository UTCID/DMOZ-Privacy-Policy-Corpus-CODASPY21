When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make (collectively, "User Submissions") to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.
We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse - overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our applications or websites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards from Miramax.
By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this privacy policy.
When you provide personal information to us on our Site, on social networking sites (depending on your privacy settings) or through an application on social networking sites, it could be seen by anyone on the Internet.
Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information.
You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social networking sites.
To participate in certain Community Forums, you may be asked to select a username, screen name or member name and password. Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a username (or screen name or member name).
For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.
Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public -- others will have access to your User Submissions and may use it or share it with third parties. Information you choose to post or make available in the community forums may be viewed, collected and used by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information.
Please also note that information submitted to our Site via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
This information allows us to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.
In addition, we may use information collected through our Site, including Personal Information, in order to: (1) process your registration, including, at times, verifying that the e-mail address you provide is active and valid; (3) provide you with information that you have requested or agreed to receive; (4) improve our Site and for internal business purposes; (5) contact you with regard to your use of our Site, your account, and, in our discretion, changes to any Miramax policy; and (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent.
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of our Site, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.
Agents and contractors of Miramax who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Miramax.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
At some places on our Site, we may ask your permission to disclose personally identifiable information about you to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If at some point you grant us permission to transfer your information for these purposes and later decide that you no longer want us to do so, simply log into your profile if you have created an account with us at our Site, or contact us here, and we will edit your preferences accordingly.
We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.
We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving details about other products and services from Miramax and other affiliated businesses and about products and services from selected third parties when you interact with our Site.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS
Some of our Site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. For instance, clicking on an advertisement or on links or other elements on our Site may take you to an entirely different site. Links to other sites may use our Site logo or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that our Site would not. Once you've left our Site, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to Personal Information or any other data collected from or provided by you. You should check the applicable privacy policy to determine how that site will handle such data.
Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies before submitting any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in our Site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information.
Our Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
Our Site may include third-party advertising and reputable third parties, websites, advertisers, or the Internet advertising companies that work on their behalf, may present or serve the advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. They automatically receive your IP (Internet Protocol) address when this happens. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies (explained below) or use Javascript, Pixel Tags and other technologies to deliver advertisements, collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information about your visits to our Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information). The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.
COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION
We, our third party service providers, and our partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Site and across the Internet. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). More specifically, Cookies are small data files that write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit us.
Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through Miramax and/or other networks or sites.
Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our Site. Web beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") embedded in our Site's content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives.
On their own, cookies Web beacons, or Pixel Tags do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies, Web beacons or Pixel Tags.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies, Web beacons and Pixel Tags as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Site can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.
OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Site and provide us with your information at your own risk.
HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION
To access the personally identifiable information that this Site has collected about you online from the pages on which this Privacy Policy is posted, to correct factual errors in such information, or to update your interests, preferences or other portions of your user profile, please log into your profile if you have created one with us or contact us here.
To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Visitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any personally identifiable information. However, if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we ask the user to register and provide us with the following information: the user's e-mail address and age information. When the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, we will either (i) collect no personally identifiable information from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, or (iii) collect the e-mail address of the user's parent in addition to the user's e-mail address. We use the parent's e-mail address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. If a user is under the age of 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share children's information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy for their own marketing purposes. If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us here.
