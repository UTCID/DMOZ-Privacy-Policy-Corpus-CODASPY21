Our Privacy Policy
Men Productions Ltd
Men Productions Ltd is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This privacy policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.
1. The information we collect and how we use it
When you purchase an individual track or album we need to know your name and email address. In addition, our payments processing company PAYPAL will need to know your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and expiry date. Please note that our site uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology at the ordering stage to protect you when entering your credit card details. This means that any data you enter into the credit card purchase form at the end of the buying process is encrypted to prevent anyone accessing your details. When entering credit card details on this site (or any web site!), always look for the padlock which appears at the bottom right of your web browser.
We gather this information to allow us to process any orders or enquiries you make. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and sub-contractors to communicate with you on any matter relating to your order and the provision of the service in general.All your personal and credit card details are used by PAYPAL to process your payment.
We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual.
From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services.
We may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products (including those of third parties) we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please send a blank e-mail message to remove@optimummusic.com
2. Our use of cookies and other information gathering technologies.

3 How we protect your information
All information i.e. your name and email address, relating to an order is stored on a secure server. We do not sell your data onto anyone else.
We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Men Productions Ltd cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.
