Cookie use - what does it mean?
Certain aspects of advertising on this site require
the use of cookies - small snippets of code which are held by your
browser, and used to track your progress when you click adverts on the
site.  Certain advertiers, including Google Ads, use cookies, in order
to track the fact that you clicked through on an advert.
Affiliates also use cookies, to trace whether you have purchased one you clicked through.
IF you don't want cookies to be used, you can switch
them off in your browser, but you may find that certain functionality of
website stops working - like sites that remember you when you come
back, or if you want to shop online.
These cookies are pretty harmless, and are very low key.  So why are
we telling you about them?  Well, you have a choice a) whether you click
through and b) whether you want to use them in the first place.
Sites are now required to tell you by law if they use cookies (as of 25th May 2011). See the following link for information :
http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/current_topics/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/advice_on_the_new_cookies_regulations.ashx
You can easily opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting using www.aboutads.info/choices which allows management of these cookies within a simple interface, letting you switch the tracking on and off as you wish.

LiveListings will only use your information when
submitted, for the purposes of fulfilling your enquiry or order and
during the normal trading of our company.
Your information may be passed to third parties where
they are a subcontractor or associate, who are necessary for the correct
answering or fulfilling of your requirements.
Your e-mail address and private information will not
be sold to third parties for the purposes of marketing, nor will it be
used for e-mail mailshots to you, unless you have expressly asked for
this.
