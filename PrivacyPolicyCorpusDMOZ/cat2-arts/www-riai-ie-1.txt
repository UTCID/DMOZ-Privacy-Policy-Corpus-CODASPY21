Cookie Policy
Introduction
This Cookie Policy describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies that may be applied on the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland site.
The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the site.
What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the website. The cookie will collect information relating to your use of our sites, information about your device such as the device’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our site via a link from third party site, the URL of the linking page.
If you are a registered user or subscriber it may also collect your name and email address, which may be transferred to data processors for registered user or subscriber verification purposes.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently remembering your preferences, and generally improving your website experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
Most sites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that site to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
A persistent cookie can remain on your computer for a pre-defined period of time, or until they are forcibly deleted. Other technologies including pixels, tags, web beacons or local storage also store and retrieve data on a device and are similar to cookies.
Cookies Used on this Site
The RIAI uses cookies in order to make this site easier to use, to support the provision of information and functionality to you, as well as to provide us with information about how this site is used so that we can make sure it is as up to date, relevant and error free as we can.
Further information about the types of cookies that are used on this site is set out below.
Please be aware that some functionality on our websites requires the use of cookies, and as such, disabling these may result in a deterioration of service. Doing so may also affect our ability to update this site to cater for user preferences and improve its performance.
Strictly Necessary Cookies
Strictly necessary cookies are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site with certain services or features.
