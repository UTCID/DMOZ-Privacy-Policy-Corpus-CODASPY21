Privacy Policy
GuitarSite.com, and its publisher Hitsquad Pty Ltd, values Your privacy.
Personal Information
We collect personal information about our users during registration for paid services and some free services, from our use of "cookie" technology as you use the service and sometimes during entry into a contest or sweepstakes.
We uses reasonable precautions to keep any personal information disclosed to us secure and we never disclose such information to third parties without your express permission. We only ever use personal information for the exact purpose we stated when you gave it to us. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. We also link to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.
Our Use Of Cookies
We primarily only set 'session cookies' which disappear from your browser when you close it down, although we may occasionally set longer lasting cookies for registered members. Only we can retrieve the cookies we have set in your browser - no other web site can see this information.
We use cookies to maintain virtual 'sessions' for your web browser so that our web server knows which information to display to you when it has to make a choice. This might be to decide if you are allowed to view certain information (such as our paid Membership service) or it may be to decide which sponsor's message or advertisement to show you.
Aggregated Information
We also collect aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because GuitarSite.com derives its revenue mainly from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.
