The 35 Most Naked Dresses of All Time
Naked dresses are perhaps the most impressive of all red carpet feats. While they may not always make the best-dressed list, they do require a certain breed of celebrity to pull off. Not only do you have to have the balls to risk a wardrobe malfunction, but you have to do it with enough confidence that you look fierce — not terrified — in the photographs.
Take Naomi Campbell's appearance in Valentino's couture show during the spring/summer 2019 presentation. The legendary model gracefully strutted down the runway in a see-through gown with a ruffle skirt. (Click through the gallery for the NSFW photo).

Let's not forget Rihanna’s infamous CFDA dress either. The girl rocked a completely sheer dress without a bra — and later remarked that her only regret was not wearing a bedazzled thong to match. That, my friends, is dedication.
Then, there was the year 2015, when the Met Gala saw not one nor two but three naked dresses on the red carpet, all worn by Hollywood’s hottest A-listers. Jennifer Lopez, above, bared her famous curves in a custom Atelier Versace illusion gown. Beyoncé was nearly naked in Givenchy. And Kim Kardashian West almost looked modest in comparison in her sheer Roberto Cavalli dress, because no one’s getting naked without KKW joining in.

The 5 Haircut Trends That Will Dominate 2020
The beginning of the new year comes with the irresistible urge to start over fresh, which means it's a great time to get a haircut.
This decade's first big hair trends include looks at every length that can be tailored to your hair texture and personal style. For anyone with a blunt bob — the most popular haircut of the past few years — you probably already guessed that the cut will still be going strong into the next decade. But there will be a few tweaks.
As seen on Kerry Washington, 2020's bob has textured, softer edges, and looks amazing whether you part it down the middle or off to the side.
RELATED: The 10 Hairstyles You'll See Everywhere This Winter
But if you swear that 2020 is going to be the year you finally grow out your hair, let Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian's extra-long lengths be your inspiration. Or, you can get the look instantly with the help of some clip in extensions.
To help you figure out how to wear your hair in the new year, we've rounded up the five biggest haircut trends of 2020, so you'll be sure of what you want before you head to the salon in January.
