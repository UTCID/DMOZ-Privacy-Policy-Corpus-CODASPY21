A heavily-armed illicit cannabis market in Monterey County is undercutting the legal market's success and endangering the community.Since January of 2019, the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office said their Marijuana Enforcement Team has removed 61,453 cannabis plants worth nearly $69 million in the legal market. They've also confiscated 7,641 pounds of processed cannabis during raids on illegal marijuana grows across the county. Detective Sergeant David Vargas who heads the task force said that amount is estimated to be just 10%-20% of the black market."I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we're only touching the surface in the black market of the Marijuana industry in Monterey County," Vargas said.The grows can be found throughout the county including in the backyards of some Salinas homes. Vargas said the illicit grows appear to be most prominent in South Monterey County in the rural, mountainous area between Carmel Valley and Greenfield.The Marijuana Enforcement Team has also taken 95 guns during raids. Vargas said these illegal operations are targets for criminals which prompts the operators of the grows to protect their product."These grows for law enforcement and the community are inherently dangerous due to the fact that the people who are operating these commercial sized grows outside the legal boundaries have to protect their product," Vargas said. "Unfortunately with these operations, everything we've seen so far, these weapons are illegally possessed."Vargas said in one home they found a firearm hidden in a baby's crib. But that's just one way they threaten public safety."The unlicensed is not subject to the testing for pesticides, mold, mildew,"
Monterey County Cannabis Program Manager Joann Iwamoto said. She added that the grows don't follow environmental regulations. Iwamoto said the Cannabis Program strategic goals includes supporting legal cannabis businesses."There's still a segment of these consumers because of the price are still leaning towards that unsafe product," Rare Earth Botica owner Sahan Sultan-Qurraie said.Sultan-Qurraie said he's invested nearly half a million to get his new Seaside store up and running by next month."It's irresponsible of the people selling that product," Sultan-Qurraie said.The Marijuana Enforcement Team has also confiscated more than $128,00 and several other drugs including methamphetamine and psychedelic mushrooms.
