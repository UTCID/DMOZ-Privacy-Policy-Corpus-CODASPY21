What we do with the information we hold
Our policy is to comply with all applicable provisions of the Data Protection Acts and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We make all reasonable efforts to keep data secure and up-to-date.
Ringing World editorial activities are carried out in accordance with the IPSO Editors' Code of Practice available at https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/. Compliance with this code requires that we aim for accuracy and fairness in what we report, publish corrections when we make mistakes, and apply a public interest test before publishing sensitive information. Compliance also means we have a moral duty to protect confidential sources of information, and do not have to disclose or erase personal information even if requested to do so.
Information on performances (peals, quarters and other similar performances), including the names of participants, is published in The Ringing World and also online on the Bellboard and peals.co.uk websites. In line with our charitable objectives, we maintain historical and statistical records of performances. We endeavour to ensure the accuracy of the information and routinely act on and publish corrections. In order to maintain the historical record, we do not change or remove information unless it is incorrect.
The Ringing World hosts three chat lists, Change Ringers, Ringing Chat and Ringing Theory. Only registered users can post to the lists. Posts represent the submitter’s own views and are not endorsed by the Ringing World. The lists have moderators. Submitters who post incorrect or offensive information are subject to moderation, and if they persist with inappropriate posts, are banned.
We only use subscriber and purchaser information in connection with delivery of the products and services which have been purchased. We only use Bellboard logins to enable submissions to Bellboard, to allow access to products and services the user has purchased, and allow user-specific settings. We only use Change Ringers, Ringing Chat and Ringing Theory logins to enable access to the corresponding chat list. We do not use any of the subscriber or personal information we hold for promotional or advertising campaigns. Our websites, although they carry advertising, do not target advertising at individuals or groups and we don’t do any automatic profiling.
Subscriber bank account details used for direct debits are passed to the company (RSM2000) who handle direct debit collection on our behalf. We use Paypal for credit and debit card payment processing. Card details are provided direct to Paypal and not held or processed by the Ringing World. With the exception of bank account details for direct debits, no data held by or processed by the Ringing World is passed to any third party. All Ringing World data is held and processed in the UK.
We will comply free of charge with reasonable requests for disclosure of personal data, except for editorial information.
