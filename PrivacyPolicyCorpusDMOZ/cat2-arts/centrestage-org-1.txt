Privacy Policy
Centre Stage (“Member”) outsources their box office services to Spektrix, the provider of the ticketing/donation service. Spektrix values the privacy of our members and customers. Spektrix does not sell any personal information to other companies.
Spektrix provides Members statistics in aggregate so Member can track the effectiveness of their online transactions. Spektrix will provide Members with enough information to provide you with services and promotional purposes if applicable.
In keeping to the highest web standards, Spektrix has provided additional information on what we track.
Server Logs
Spektrix’s application servers store your IP address in standard server logs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems, and optimize (and maintain) our servers. Spektrix may use this information in aggregate to provide statistics to our Members.
Cookies
We use browser cookies to keep track of your individual session state; how many tickets, donation amount, event details, etc. This also allows us to differentiate you from another patron.
Spektrix does not belong to any group that tracks users across web sites.
Contact and Personal Information
Spektrix reserves the right to share a Member’s and patron’s contact and personal information with individuals and/or entities for legitimate purposes such as copyright infringement claims brought against a member for the images found in it. We would use this information only as necessary.
If Spektrix does use mailing lists for advertising or promotional purposes, we will always have a clear mechanism for you to remove yourself from future mailings.
Spektrix may require information for shipping and billing. Spektrix may only use this information for promotional purposes if you explicitly grant us permission.
