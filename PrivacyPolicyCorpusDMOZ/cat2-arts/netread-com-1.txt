PRIVACY
Personal Information
One of NetRead’s goals as a company is to give you maximum control over information about you and your products.
In general, you can visit NetRead on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Like most companies doing business on the web, we track of the domains where visitors are coming from. We analyze this data for trends and statistics–generally to check the effectiveness of our advertising and search engine listings. This information cannot be used to reach you, and we discard it anyway after looking for trends.
In order to use JacketCaster or EventCaster, we require contact information, which is for our internal use only and will remain confidential.
If you choose to receive regular email from NetRead, such as event listings generated by EventCaster, you can unsubscribe at any time and we will respect your wishes.
Information Security and Quality
We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner.
Business Relationships
