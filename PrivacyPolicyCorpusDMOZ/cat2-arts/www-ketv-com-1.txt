With everything going on with the pandemic, a lot of people are seeking help with their mental health.With so many added stresses from COVID-19, job pressures, family and financial challenges and kids at home 24/7, many people are grieving and some don't realize it."Our world as a whole is experiencing a collective loss, and so we're all going through a grief," said Monty Miller, a psychotherapist at Saint Luke's. "So many of us just want life to get back to the way it was, and the truth is it will never be the way it was."He said people need to find meaning. It's the new sixth stage of the grief process."Our kids are missing loss from going to school, being with friends, being with sports and activities. Their loss is just as important as our adult loss. We need to recognize that," Miller said.He said we have to name it to feel it and feel it to heal it."Simply because I accept something, doesn't mean I approve of it. (It) doesn't mean I invited it or wanted it. It just means I'm accepting life on life's terms because I can't control it, " Miller said. He said extra stress occurs when we try to change things that we can't change."We get just too self-focused. I know when I take the focus off myself and look out for other people, I feel better," Miller said.He said helping others can often be key to meaning and feeling good inside. Experts remind people to eat healthy, exercise, get enough sleep and follow a routine. If needed, consider therapy or counseling.
