Like most websites and mobile applications, our Website uses cookies. A cookie is a small, often encrypted file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser, your computer, your mobile device or other device. They help us improve our Website and your general experience on it. We, or our third party partners, may also employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you

We may share your information with selected third parties including:
Our mailing partner, to deliver messages to you in accordance with the purposes set out above.
Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.
We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with anonymous aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. As part of this process, we may also share this information with record companies, publishing companies and similar organisations that market our recordings, concerts etc.

Suppliers of IT systems and services for the purpose of ensuring the correct operation, or enhancing the operation of IT systems, or to ensure the safety and security of personal data.
We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
We may disclose your personal information in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, or if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, on the basis of their and our legitimate interest in negotiating and completing such transaction and their legitimate interests in continuing the business as purchased.
WHERE AND HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. For example, our suppliers use secure servers to store all information you provide to us.
We share the information we hold with suppliers of IT systems and services for the purpose of ensuring the correct operation, or enhancing the operation of IT systems, or to ensure the safety and security of personal data. Most of our partners store and access your data only within the European Union. Where we send out direct mail, as described in this Notice, your data is shared with a mailing partner who stores the data outside the European Union. Where this occurs it is done on the basis of the receiving party being certified with the EU-US Privacy Shield.
A copy of the appropriate safeguards can be obtained by writing to us at the email address given in this Notice. The data we collect from or about you may also be processed by staff operating outside the EU who work for us. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice.
HOW LONG WE HOLD YOUR INFORMATION FOR
We will store the data you provide to us for only as long as your consent remains valid. Data regarding your use of the Website will generally only be held for a short period, according to the policy of our website analytics partner.
YOUR RIGHTS
We will not use your personal data for direct marketing purposes unless you have provided your consent to us, or to a third party via which we have received the data. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for these purposes.
The GDPR provides you with rights to:
request from us confirmation of whether or not your personal data is being processed and where that is the case, confirmation of the information set out in this Notice;
request from us a copy of your data that is undergoing processing, including, in relation to data provided to us by you, and which is processed by automatic means pursuant to a contract with you, or pursuant to your consent, a right to request that data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format;
request that we rectify or complete your personal data, where it is inaccurate or incomplete for the purposes of our processing of the data;
request that we erase your personal data in the following circumstances:
the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;
you withdraw consent and there is no other legal ground for the processing;
you successfully object to the processing pursuant to your right of objection explained below;
the personal data has been unlawfully processed;
the erasure is necessary for compliance with a relevant legal obligation that applies to us;
request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in the following circumstances:
you contest the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling us to verify the same;
the processing is unlawful, but you request restriction rather than erasure;
we no longer need the data, but it is required by you in respect of legal claims;
you have objected to the processing, until such that that we verify that there are legitimate purposes that justify such processing;
object to any processing that is based on our, or a third party’s legitimate interests, upon which event we shall suspend processing until we demonstrate legitimate purposes that justify that processing. We may at all times continue to use data for the purpose of establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
withdraw your consent for future processing (where the processing is based on that consent);
lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office, which is the data protection supervisory authority in the UK.
We will comply with any valid request for information under the rights explained above within one month, though we may tell you that this period is to be extended by a further two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. This will normally be provided free of charge. If the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to action the request.
The provision of personal data to us is neither a statutory nor contractual requirement.
