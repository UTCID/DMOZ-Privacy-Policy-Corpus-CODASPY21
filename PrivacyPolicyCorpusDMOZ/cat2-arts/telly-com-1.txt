OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SERVICE; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE
TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR

LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN
AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO MAHATAT HEREUNDER OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF MAHATAT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE
APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR
EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER
RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Mahatat makes no
representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or
use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for
compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to
export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the
United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless
otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies,
or other entities located in the United States.
Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
Governing Law. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, this Agreement shall be governed
by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws
principles. You may also be entitled to certain consumer protection rights under the laws of your local
jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration
conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Except as provided in the Arbitration provision below, the parties agree to submit to the
personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California (“Santa Clara
Courts”) to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of this Agreement, unless you and Mahatat
agree otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Mahatat from seeking injunctive or other equitable
relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation
or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or
proprietary rights, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that the
Santa Clara Courts are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings
in the event that the Arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES PARTIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED
STATES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MAHATAT. If you are
a User located in the United States (including its possessions and territories), for any dispute with Mahatat,
you agree to first contact us at support@mahatat.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In
the unlikely event that Mahatat has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do
so for a period of sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any
claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures
for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be
conducted in Santa Clara County, California (or the nearest AAA office), unless you and Mahatat agree
otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any
AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. If you are an individual using
the Service for personal use, AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org and may require you to pay a fee for the
initiation of your case unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA. You may also be
required to pay a portion of the arbitrator’s fees as delineated in the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes
Supplementary Procedures (subject to the fee waiver provision), which may be found on the AAA website. The
award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable
costs for expert and other witnesses, unless prohibited by applicable law, and any judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security,
intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. If you are an individual using the Service for your
personal use, you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in
arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution
process.
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND,
UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT,
BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND MAHATAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
General
Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Mahatat without restriction. Any attempted transfer or
assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Mahatat may provide notifications,
whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you
via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined
by Mahatat in our sole discretion. Mahatat reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing
notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in
this Agreement. Mahatat is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply
to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Mahatat may, in its sole discretion,
modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we
change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page.
Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use.
If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to
access) the Service.
Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any
additional agreements you may enter into with Mahatat in connection with the Service, shall constitute the
entire agreement between you and Mahatat concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the
event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement
shall be unenforceable.
No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing
waiver of such term or any other term, and Mahatat’s failure to assert any right or provision under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
