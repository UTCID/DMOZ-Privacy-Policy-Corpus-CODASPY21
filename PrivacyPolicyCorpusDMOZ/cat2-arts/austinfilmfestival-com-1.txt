My best experience ever at a film festival was in Austin.
So many festivals are flash over substance, a who’s who of movie stars.
Here, the creators are the stars. And rightly so. So if you want to write, direct or produce motion pictures and get paid for it, attend this festival.” – David McKenna (BLOW, AMERICAN HISTORY X)The ConferenceOur Conference is a one-of-a-kind event.
