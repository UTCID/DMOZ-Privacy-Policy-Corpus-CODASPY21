These Terms of Use are last Modified and Effective as of: December 3, 2018.
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to any websites, kiosks, mobile applications, features, widgets or other online services that are owned or controlled by ArcLight Cinema Company (“ArcLight”) and that post or include a link to these Terms (collectively, the “ArcLight Platforms”), whether accessed via computer, kiosk, mobile device or otherwise.  IMPORTANT! PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS BEFORE USING THE ARCLIGHT PLATFORMS, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ARBITRATE YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST ARCLIGHT, YOU MUST NOT USE THE ARCLIGHT PLATFORMS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN US THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO YOUR USE OF THE ARCLIGHT PLATFORMS (“CLAIMS”) MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH MANDATORY, BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN LITIGATION IN COURT. THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, WILL DECIDE ANY CLAIM.
These Terms do not apply to any other website or online service or any offline activities by ArcLight (unless specifically stated). You agree to these Terms by accessing or using the ArcLight Platforms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE ARCLIGHT PLATFORMS.

Please note that certain features or services referenced in these Terms may not be offered on every version of the ArcLight Platforms at all times. In addition, there may be times when we offer a service or feature that has its own applicable terms and conditions in addition these Terms (“Additional Terms”).  In those cases, the Additional Terms will control to the extent there is a conflict with these Terms, unless the Additional Terms state otherwise. If you elect to join the ArcLight Membership Program, your enrollment as a member will be subject to the ArcLight Membership Program Terms and Conditions (“AMP Terms”), which are Additional Terms.

Social Features
You may choose, at your discretion and risk, to use features that enable interactions between the ArcLight Platforms and a third-party service (each, a “Social Application”), such as linking your activities on the ArcLight Platforms with a third-party platform or enabling you to “like” an item on the ArcLight Platforms or “share” content to other services. Such Social Applications may interact with, connect to, or gather or pull information from and to your user account or profile on the ArcLight Platforms. By using such features, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use a feature to share information relating to your ArcLight Platform activity, you are consenting to your information and content being shared; (ii) your use of a Social Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if ArcLight has not provided such information; and (iii) your use of a Social Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold ArcLight harmless for the sharing of information relating to your ArcLight Platform activity. You must read all login and other pop-up boxes closely for notices about sharing your content and information with, through or by any other means identified in a Social Application.
Information and Content that You Submit
We may provide you the opportunity on the ArcLight Platforms to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features, and through other communication functionality (collectively, "User Forums").  You may choose to submit or post images, videos, writings, questions, comments, suggestions or other user-generated content (collectively, "User Content") via the User Forums or otherwise.
Rights You Grant to Us. Whenever you submit, post, upload, or otherwise make available User Content on a User Forum or directly to ArcLight (including by email or text message) you: (1) grant to ArcLight an irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully sub-licensable and assignable, royalty-free license to use, exploit, reproduce, modify, translate, incorporate in other works, create derivative works from, publish, broadcast, and perform that User Content and your name, voice, likeness and other identifying information in connection with that User Content via any medium now known or later developed, without any compensation to you; and (2) waive all of your moral rights in that User Content to the fullest extent permitted by law, even if the User Content is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. You further authorize ArcLight to publish your User Content in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the ArcLight Platforms and online services.
Right To Screen and Remove Content.  We retain the right (but not the obligation unless required by law), in our sole discretion and for any reason, to prescreen, monitor, edit, refuse to accept, post, remove, or move any User Content. However, we are not responsible for the content of User Content and if your User Content contains offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable content, or infringes on the rights of any third party, you may bear legal responsibility for that User Content. You agree that ArcLight has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content, but has the right to protect and enforce its and its licensees' licensed rights to your User Content.
No Confidential Relationship/No Unsolicited Materials. User Content will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of User Content, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with ArcLight is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any User Content does not place ArcLight in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your User Content. None of your User Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of ArcLight.
ArcLight does not accept unsolicited User Content, including, without limitation, ideas for products, services, or features. We wish to avoid any misunderstandings when projects developed by or on behalf of ArcLight may seem to others to be similar to their own creative ideas or materials. Therefore, please do not submit any such unsolicited User Content to us through the ArcLight Platforms (including any User Forum), by email, or otherwise. If you nonetheless decide to make any such unsolicited submission, you agree to grant to ArcLight the right and license to your unsolicited submission as set forth in the "Rights You Grant to Us” subsection, above.
Representations You Make to Us. You are responsible for all of your User Content. By submitting User Content, you represent and warrant to ArcLight that your User Content: (1) is not confidential and that you have all necessary permission to submit it; and (2) does not infringe upon, misappropriate, or violate the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or any other proprietary rights.
No Obligation to Use. You agree and understand that we are not obligated to post, keep or use your User Content.
User Interactions and Disputes
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the ArcLight Platforms, whether within the ArcLight Platforms or elsewhere. We are not responsible for the conduct of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others, when you submit or post any information, and in all other online activities.
Acceptable Use Policy
The following rules are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of you when you participate on any User Forum or other interactive areas of the ArcLight Platforms. You agree that your participation in a User Forum or other interactive area of the ArcLight Platforms is subject to all of these Terms, including the following "Acceptable Use Policy":
Public forum. A User Forum is a public forum and User Content that you post on a User Forum will be accessible and viewable by others. Do not post personal information (e.g., full name, password, phone number, address, email address or other personally identifiable/contact information).
Don't share other people's personal information. Your User Content may not reveal another person's address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual or that is personal in nature.
User Content must be yours. All User Content must be original to you and you must have all rights in the User Content (or it must be in the public domain); OR, all persons who contributed in any way or have any rights to your User Content or otherwise appear in the User Content must have given you permission to upload and distribute the User Content on the ArcLight Platforms and elsewhere.
Don't upload third-party materials. Your User Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases or trademarks or other third-party materials. Do not use any User Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own. This includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
No pictures or images of anyone but you and your friends and family. If the ability to upload photos is made available on the ArcLight Platforms and you choose to use such a feature (or to otherwise include images of real people in any User Content), make sure photos are only of you or of you and someone you know personally, but, in any event, only with their express permission to post it.
Original music only. Do not play or include any music, lyrics, or poetry in your User Content unless it is your original piece and performed only by you (or you have all rights to the musical work, including any performances). No jingles, sampling or otherwise using existing music.
Keep it relevant. Your User Content should relate to the content on the ArcLight Platforms and should be intended to add to the discussion and community on the ArcLight Platforms – it should not include irrelevant topics or postings.
Please follow codes of social decency. Express yourself with non-offensive individual self-expression. Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build a User Forum for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User Content might offend someone, chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on a User Forum. Cursing, flaming, trolling, harassing, stalking, posting insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, or similar actions are prohibited. Your User Content may not threaten, abuse, or harm others. Your User Content may not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual preference, or physical handicap, or that are defamatory, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
Do not use a User Forum for commercial purposes. Your User Content may not advertise or promote a product or service except those provided on the ArcLight Platforms or otherwise offered by ArcLight. You may not use your User Content to raise money for anyone or for a pyramid or other multi-tiered marketing scheme.
Do not upload User Content that is inappropriate or illegal. Your User Content may not promote any illegal activity. If someone could go to jail or incur criminal or civil liability for taking action suggested by your User Content, don't upload or post it. If you do upload or post User Content that is illegal or in violation of applicable law, we reserve the right to take any action that we (in our sole discretion) deem appropriate, including reporting you to the proper governmental authorities.
No violence. Your User Content may not promote violence or describe how to perform a violent or otherwise illegal or dangerous act.
Be honest and do not misrepresent yourself or your User Content. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company (including impersonating a representative of ArcLight) or upload or post User Content that you know is false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, misleading or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
Don't damage the ArcLight Platforms or anyone's device. User Content may not contain malware, viruses, Trojan horses, spyware or any other technologies that could impact the operation of the ArcLight Platforms or any system.
Viral Content Distribution
ArcLight may grant you -- but only through express written permission -- the limited, revocable permission to engage in certain expressly described personal uses of Materials as may from time to time be made available on the ArcLight Platforms ("Viral Distribution"). Express written permission for Viral Distribution may include: (a) sending Materials to friends or acquaintances at no charge or (b) posting and displaying a copy of Materials on another online service that permits users to post content (so long as the posting is allowed pursuant to the third-party service’s terms and conditions, and provided that the third-party service does not charge for access to those materials or associate those materials with other products, services or advertising). You agree that you will not post any claims about an ArcLight product or service when engaging in Viral Distribution. In other words, you understand that only ArcLight can make claims, promises or statements on behalf of ArcLight about our products or services. You also agree that you will not imply that you and ArcLight are affiliated in any way or that ArcLight approves of your comments. We reserve the right to revoke our permission for Viral Distribution at any time and for any reason and you agree to immediately cease Viral Distribution upon notice of revocation and to comply with any terms we post in connection the Viral Distribution of Materials.
If expressly permitted and made available on the ArcLight Platforms, you may engage in Viral Distribution pursuant to these Terms, but you will not otherwise make any use of or license, distribute, reproduce, or otherwise exploit any part of the Materials without our express written permission.
Membership & Registration
Certain areas of the ArcLight Platforms may require registration or may otherwise ask you to provide information to participate in certain features or access certain Materials or User Content. The decision to provide this information is purely optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to access certain Materials or User Content or participate in certain features of the ArcLight Platforms, including purchasing movie tickets. When you provide information to the ArcLight Platforms, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current, and complete information and to update it as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy.
If you register with us, you agree you will not sell, transfer or assign your membership or any membership rights.

ArcLight reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to terminate your account or otherwise deny you access without notice.
Without limiting the foregoing and as described above, if you elect to join the ArcLight Membership Program, your enrollment as a member will be subject to the AMP Terms as well as these Terms.
Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions
Any sweepstakes, contest or other promotion (any, a "Promotion") that may be offered via the ArcLight Platforms may be governed by a separate set of rules that may have eligibility requirements (such as certain age or geographic area restrictions) and other terms and conditions governing the Promotion, use of User Content submitted in connection with the Promotion, and disclosures about how your personal information may be used. It is your responsibility to read these rules to determine whether or not you want to and are eligible to participate, register, and/or enter, and to determine the applicable terms and conditions of the Promotion. By participating in a Promotion, you will be subject to those official rules, and you agree to comply with and abide by such rules and the decisions of the identified sponsor(s).

Software related to or made available by this ArcLight Platforms may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from these ArcLight Platforms may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to these ArcLight Platforms, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.
You agree to comply with all rules, laws and regulations that are applicable to your use of the ArcLight Platforms, including, without limitation, those governing your transmission or use of any software or data.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. You and Arclight agree that all disputes between you and Arclight with regard to these Terms or your use of the ArcLight Platforms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's (AAA) rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes or under the streamlined Arbitration Rules Procedures of JAMS Inc. (“JAMS”) or any successor to JAMS.  In the event both AAA and JAMS are unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a “Demand for Arbitration”, then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by another mutually agreeable arbitration administration service who will hear the case.  YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE A TRIAL BY JURY.  CLASS ACTION WAIVER: Neither you nor Arclight will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms.  In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and review is limited.  The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with limited exceptions, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the above, Arclight will be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in the state and federal courts in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
Desktop, online, written or telephone arbitration can be used for claims.  If an in-person hearing is requested by you, required by the arbitrator or required by the rules of the arbitration administration hearing the claims, then arbitration will take place in Los Angeles County, California or Cook County, Illinois (determined by the party initiating arbitration) or any other location Arclight agrees to.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the rules of the arbitration administration hearing the claims.  The arbitrator(s) will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator(s) determine a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator(s) may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.  In all other cases, you will bear 50% of the fees charged by the arbitration administration hearing the claims and you alone will be responsible for your attorneys’ fees.  Notwithstanding the above, you will pay for all of your own travel costs if you initiate arbitration and you request an in-person hearing.   Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrators will not have any authority to award punitive or exemplary damages.
THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS (AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE CHOICE OF LAW RULES) OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL GOVERN THE VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THESE TERMS AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS.  THESE TERMS WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE.
You agree that any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. Arclight reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.  This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Arclight.
Third-Party Beneficiary
If you access the ArcLight Platforms via an application on Apple’s iOS Platform, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of the Terms. If you are accessing the ArcLight Platforms via an application on Apple’s iOS Platform, you agree that if the application or your possession and use of the application infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, you will not hold Apple responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claims.
Miscellaneous
The failure of ArcLight to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit ArcLight’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. No waiver by ArcLight of any of these Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of ArcLight. Neither the course of conduct between the parties, nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms. ArcLight may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without any notice to you. These Terms may not be assigned by you without ArcLight’s prior written consent. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable by a court or other adjudicative body of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The section titles in these Terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against ArcLight by virtue of ArcLight having drafted them. Provisions of these Terms that would logically survive termination shall survive the termination of these Terms for any reason (including without limitation, Our Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability; Waiver, and Dispute Resolution and Arbitration).
ArcLight will not be liable to you or be deemed to be in breach of its obligations under these Terms for any delay or failure in performance caused by acts beyond ArcLight’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, terrorism, accidents, fires, floods, strikes, labor disputes, mechanical breakdown, shortages or delays in obtaining supplies, materials, labor, or transportation, interruption of utility services or the Internet, acts of any unit of government or any governmental agency, or any similar or dissimilar cause.
Modifications
ArcLight reserves the right to modify or add to these Terms as described in this section ("Updated Terms"). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by making them available via the ArcLight Platforms, and that your use of the ArcLight Platforms after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms before using the ArcLight Platforms. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the ArcLight Platforms from that point forward.
