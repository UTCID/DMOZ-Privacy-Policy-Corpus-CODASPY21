The Stanford Libraries seek to provide patrons with a safe and productive environment suitable for reading, studying, and other scholarly activities. These policies support that objective. See the pages in this section for policies governing conduct, animals, and photography in library buildings, as well as guidelines for counsel and researchers seeking discovery from the Libraries, workplace and sponsored conference conduct, and the libraries statement on patron privacy for database access.
