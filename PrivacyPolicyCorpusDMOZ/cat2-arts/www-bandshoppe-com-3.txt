Uniforms cannot be added or cancelled in an existing custom order once the order has been placed into production. You may be asked to provide a uniform from your previous order to ensure correct duplication. If so, please send to us promptly to prevent any delays in production of your order.
COLOR MATCHING	Band Shoppe strives to maintain standard colors with all of our merchandise. However, it is scientifically impossible to achieve a perfect color match from one dye lot to another. A slight shade or dye lot difference may be noticeable between orders, different fabrics, and under different lighting. For free fabric swatches, contact Band Shoppe's Sales Team at 1.800.457.3501. Please be specific when requesting the shade of color you desire (ex: Kelly Green, instead of Green). Band Shoppe is not responsible for incorrect color matches.
MANUFACTURING SCHEDULE	The manufacturing schedule for custom items can be viewed online at BandShoppe.com. Manufacturing schedules posted provide an estimated time of manufacturing. Manufacturing of your order will not begin until the complete order, including style, color, sizing, and payment information is received. Band Shoppe is not liable for any delay or failure due to conditions beyond our control, which include but are not limited to delivery delays, weather, strikes, raw material availability, and other unavoidable circumstances.
Occasionally, a question about your order may require us to contact you. Should this occur, your order will be placed on hold until we are able to contact you and resolve the issue. We will make every attempt to reach you regarding the issue. Please respond to all correspondence promptly to prevent any further delay in your order.
RISK OF LOSS	The risk of loss and title for all items purchased from Band Shoppe pass to you upon our delivery to the customer.
RETURNSBand Shoppe offers a 30-day Return policy on most stock items. Electronics have a 15-day Return policy. Before items are returned, customer must first obtain a Return Authorization Number from Band Shoppe's Customer Care Department by calling 1.800.457.3501 or email wecare@BandShoppe.com. Returns CANNOT be accepted unless a Return Authorization Number has been issued. Return Authorization Number MUST be written on the OUTSIDE of all returned packages. Any packages returned without a Return Authorization Number will be refused and the customer will be responsible for shipping charges that are incurred. The customer has 15-days to return items once Return Authorization Number has been issued by our Customer Care Department.
Merchandise is non-returnable after 30 days from the date of the invoice. Any goods not returned in this period will result in the customer keeping the goods and being responsible for all charges. The customer is responsible for return shipping on returns. EXCHANGES ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Shipping charges are not refundable unless the merchandise is found to be defective by the manufacturer, or if an incorrect shipment is the result of a Band Shoppe error. If an incorrect item or size was ordered, the customer will need to return the incorrect item and place a separate order. The customer will be refunded the purchase price of the merchandise after item has been inspected and cleared to return to inventory. This may take up to 2-3 weeks to process the return. All returned items must be unworn and in NEW RESALABLE condition and in their original packaging. Shoe boxes must not be written on. There is a $10 fee per box for shoe boxes that are returned damaged, have postage or tape affixed, or have been written on. If items appear to have been worn, they will be returned to the customer and the customer will be responsible for the cost of return shipping. Please allow approximately 2 weeks to process your return. Special design or custom-made items cannot be returned. Custom items include but are not limited to custom garments, custom warm-ups, any garments or items with screen print, embroidery, or any other customization. Briefs, bodysuits, and tights along with hair accessories cannot be returned due to health reasons. Items worn or soiled cannot be returned.
CORRECTIONS	Please open all boxes immediately. If there is a discrepancy with your order, you must report it to our office within 10 days of delivery. If you do not report discrepancies to our office in a timely manner, additional shipping charges may apply to upgrade the shipping on the replacement or correction of your order. In the event of missing items, duplicate shipments, incorrect sizes or color, lost shipments, or product design defects, please contact the Band Shoppe Customer Care Department by calling 1.800.457.3501 or email wecare@bandshoppe.com.
