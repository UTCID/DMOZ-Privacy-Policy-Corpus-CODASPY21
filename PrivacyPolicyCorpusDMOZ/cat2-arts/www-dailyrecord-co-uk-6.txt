The legislation, proposed by Scottish Labour MSP Daniel Johnson, would make attacking a shop worker a specific offence. Abuse or assaults related to the sale of an age-restricted product or service such as alcohol or tobacco would also become an aggravating factor in law and attract higher penalties, if the Bill is passed.

“When we ask people to uphold the law, they should have the specific protection of the law,” Johnson said, citing similar principles for emergency service workers, customs and border staff. He added: “Shop workers provide a vital frontline service. “And while the pandemic has brought new insight into the critical role played by these workers, the reality is that they always have done. “They keep us safe, they uphold the law. “Let’s take this opportunity to ensure that they have the protection of the law, it is the very least we owe them for their vital public work.” Johnson said that the coronavirus lockdown “undoubtedly brought into sharp focus” the need for additional protection, with research from the Usdaw trade union suggesting abuse, threats and violent incidents doubled during the pandemic. He added that almost 70% of retail workers say that enforcing social distancing has been the biggest cause of abuse and violence at work, according to a poll by the union. “That is completely unacceptable,” Johnson said. “Violence, threats and abuse are simply not just part of the job for anyone, whether you work behind a desk or behind a shop counter, but it should not have taken the pandemic to provide this insight.” Community safety minister Ash Denham said the Scottish Government would be backing the Member’s Bill, subject to certain changes at stage two. Denham said that evidence to the Economy and Fair Work Committee demonstrated the level of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour people were exposed to. “So let me be really clear, this type of criminal conduct is absolutely unacceptable and perpetrators should be held to account,” she said. Denham explained that she wants parts of the proposed Bill making hindering and obstructing staff in their duties an offence to be dropped, arguing it would “set too low of a threshold for criminal sanctions”. Both the Scottish Conservative and Scottish Green MSPs Liam Kerr and Andy Wightman spoke of their reluctance to legislate to “send a message”, but said they supported the general principles of the Bill so would be backing Johnson’s proposal. “Sometimes a new offence clearly targeted at abusive behaviour against a defined group of vulnerable people is the way forward,” Wightman said. Kerr added that “enhanced education, training and public awareness is a crucial element” crucial element of the Bill, in addition to the new offences. Scottish Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie said she hoped the legislation, if passed, would give shop workers the confidence to report abuse and assault.

She said: “Far too many abusers get away with it because there isn’t adequate legislation in place to hold them accountable for their abhorrent behaviour. “So it is time to let shop workers knew that abuse is simply not part and parcel of the job that they do; that their suffering can and will stop. “This Bill must be a warning to all those who have and will continue to abuse shop staff, the law will be on the side of the workers, and offenders will finally have to deal with the consequences of their actions.”TheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordMore OnScottish Parliament
