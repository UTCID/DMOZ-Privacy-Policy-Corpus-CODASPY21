1. School or college projects;
2. Legitimate, "not-for-profit" educational or conservation projects and initiatives;
All you have to do is ask; simply use the Contact Form and tell me how the photo(s) will be used.
Note: For anyone wanting to use pictures on their own websites,
please make use of the free pictures that are now offered specifically for that purpose.
For artists needing wildlife reference photos, please see our new site, African Reference Photos .
If you have any questions about usage, or are interested
in using any images for commercial use, please feel free to contact me.
