Background Papers
Local Development Plan 1
Home / Planning / Planning Policy / Local Development Plan 1 / Background Papers
Share This
The first stage in preparing the plan is to review the existing information from the evidence base and then gather further evidence where necessary. This is to ensure that the development plan is based on real evidence so that the plan will be deemed to be 'sound'. This includes plans and proposals by other organisations. These Background Papers have been updated and added to throughout the preparation of the Plan.
Key documents to consider are:
Enjoyment Background Paper
Housing Background Paper (an update of the Housing Background Paper has been prepared for the Examination at the request of the Inspector)
Minerals Background Paper
Retail Background Paper
Scale and Location of Growth Background Paper
Green Wedge Background Paper
