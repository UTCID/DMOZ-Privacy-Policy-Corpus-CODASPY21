These terms of use ("Terms") set forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the SFX-Disco Operating LLC (hereinafter, "DDP," "we," "our," or "us") website at https://somethingwonderful.com/ (the "Site"), use of our mobile application (the "Mobile App"), and the other services, features, content and applications offered by us on the Site or on the Mobile App.
The Site, Mobile App, and any other services, features, content and applications offered by DDP may each be referred to herein as a "Service" and collectively as the "Services".
PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY IF YOU WISH TO USE OUR SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.
1. Privacy
Please see our Privacy Policy for information and disclosures relating to the collection and use of your Personal Information, as defined therein, and any other data in connection with your use of the Services.
Our Privacy Policy can be found at http://somethingwonderful.com/privacy-policy.
2. Use of Site and Mobile App
No charge is made for the general use of the Site or Mobile App, unless you choose to purchase tickets, merchandise or other services or goods. If you wish to make a purchase, you must click on the designated link at the top of the page, fill in any required information and follow the instructions. When you purchase a ticket to the Something Wonderful Music Festival (the "Festival"), you will be issued a wristband which contains a radio frequency identification ("RFID") chip. Please be aware that you will not be issued a physical ticket to the Festival; your wristband is your ticket. You will also receive instructions for the use of the wristband, as well as information about how to register your wristband online for additional convenience and benefits.
Your attendance at the Festival is subject to your acceptance of the Festival Terms and Conditions, which can be found at http://somethingwonderful.com/ticketing-terms-conditions.
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms on this webpage. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) our Services.
3. Registration and Security
In order to register and purchase your wristband, you will be asked for certain information, such as your name, age, telephone number, physical address, email address, emergency contact and other information ("Registration Data"). You are solely responsible for your wristband and its use. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your wristband. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your wristband, either with or without your knowledge. In addition, you may be held liable for any losses incurred by us or another party due to someone else using your wristband.
You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms; (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to us, to keep it accurate, current and complete; and (c) be fully responsible for all use of your wristband. You may not transfer your registration or wristband to another person or share it with anyone. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage that may result if you fail to comply with these requirements.
By subscribing to, or accessing, the Services, you are representing to us that you are authorized to use the credit card or other form of payment you submit (if any). We use third parties to facilitate payment transactions and you should review such third party terms and conditions before entering into any transaction. We are not liable or responsible for such third party transactions.
If any part of our Services requires a login or password, then such login and password are for your personal use only. You may not reveal your login or password to anyone else or permit anyone to use your login or password to access the particular Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your login and password and accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You must notify us immediately if the security of your login or password has been breached.
4. Public Forums and Your Submissions
The Services may provide chat rooms, forums, message boards, blog feeds, news groups and/or other interactive tools to its users including links to third party websites, applications or third party "plug-ins".

By uploading, publishing, modifying or displaying User Content to any part of our Services, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to us an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), transmit, and distribute such User Content for any purpose on or in connection with the Services.
You represent and warrant that your User Content will not contain any material that: (a) is false, inaccurate, or misleading; (b) infringes any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (c) violates any law or regulation; (d) is defamatory, constitutes trade libel or product disparagement, or is unlawfully threatening, harassing, or contains hate speech; (e) is obscene or contains pornography; or (f) contains any computer programming routines such as viruses, Trojan horses, time bombs, or other malicious code or programs that may damage or interfere with the operation of any system, or unlawfully intercept any data or personal information.
You understand and agree that we do not verify or vouch for any such content and if we determine, in our sole discretion, that any User Content is inaccurate, was posted or uploaded without authorization, or otherwise does or may violate these Terms or applicable laws, we reserve the right, at any time, without prior notice and without limiting any and all other rights we may have, at law or in equity, to: (a) modify, refuse, or remove the User Content; (b) revoke the applicable user's right to use any or all of our Services; and/or (c) use any technological, legal, operational, or other means available to us to enforce the provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, blocking specific IP addresses or deactivating the applicable user's registration. Please note, if we delete any information provided by you, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying a recycle bin on a computer and you acknowledge that any removed information or content may persist in backup copies or may be imbedded in the Service as aggregate data.

6. Copyright
We respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask you to do the same. It is important (and a condition of these Terms) that you only send us data and information or post content that you own and/or control -- and not content owned and/or controlled by others. You are fully responsible for your User Content.

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We reserve the right to terminate any user's account without notice if that user is determined to be a "repeat infringer" of others' intellectual property.
