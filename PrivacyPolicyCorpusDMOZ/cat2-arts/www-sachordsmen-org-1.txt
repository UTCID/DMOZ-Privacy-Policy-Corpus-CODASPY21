Chordsmen have begun rehearsing again.
Our new location is the LDS church 7420 Huebner Rd.
Your support is much appreciated during these times.
If you would like to make a donation, please click below! The Chordsmen have been singing in San Antonio since the 50's and just this year marked their 64th year by opening the door to ladies who love to sing!
We are a diverse group who contributes to the community by partnering with organizations such as the Salvation Army to help causes that benefit San Antonio and the surrounding area.
We meet on Monday nights at 7 pm at the LDS Church 7420 Huebner Rd.
If you like to sing and want to serve, then by all means come visit us!
We look forward to meeting you! https://www.facebook.com/SanAntonioChordsmen/Report abuseGoogle SitesReport abuse
