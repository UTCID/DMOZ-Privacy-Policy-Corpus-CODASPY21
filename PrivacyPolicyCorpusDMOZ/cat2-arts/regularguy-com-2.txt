Please read this Statement carefully as it affects your rights and liabilities under the law. If you disagree or do not accept with the way we collect and process your PII or Non-PII, please do not use this website.

Our website predominantly contains links to third party websites over which we have no control. As such, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third party websites when you choose to link to them from our website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of those third party websites to understand how they collect, use and share your information.
Information We Collect and Retain
We collect the following general types of information about you when you contact us regarding our website:
Personally identifiable information [PII]: is information that can be used to personally identify you. We do not collect PII.
Behavioral information: is information pertaining to how you use our website; the areas of our website that you visit; what ads or services you accessed; and information about your computer hardware and software including your IP address, geographic location, browser preference, operating system type, domain names, times that you access the internet and other website you have been referred to us through. This information is necessary to analyze the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services and products.
Web technology information: is information we automatically collect from you when you open one of our emails or visit our Website. This includes information collected from the use of cookies, web beacons or java script as discussed below.
No Information Collected from Children: We never knowingly collect any Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personally Identifiable Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no information regarding its use or disclose to third parties.
Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script
Cookies: “Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of our Website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content or links you view or may have viewed on past visits. When you visit our site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your past viewing history or the email or site that directed you to our Website. You can disable cookies, although the website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of our Website, you need to accept cookies.
Removing Cookies: You have the ability to accept, decline or remove cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on our website. The National Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) offers an opt-out tool (located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managin/opt_out.asp) for the purpose of allowing consumers to “opt-out” of the behavioural advertising delivered by its member companies. Some of the third parties with whom we have entered into contractual arrangements are members of NAI.
Web Beacons: We also use electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages). This measures and improves the effectiveness of advertisements and delivery of services. Web beacons are not used to access your PII; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the types of visitors to our website; how those visitors use our website; and the effectiveness of advertisements. We may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.
Disabling Web Beacons: Because web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.
JavaScript: We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of our website, particularly with respect to pictures. We do not collect any PII through JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve our website’s functions.
Disabling JavaScript: You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of our website.
IP Addresses: Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers and collect information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the web. Your IP address can reveal what geographic area you are connecting from and which ISP you are using. We automatically track certain information based upon your actions on our website. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from and which URL you next go to after visiting our website, your computer browser information in addition to your IP address.
Computer Profiles: We may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the experience of our visitors. For instance, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with PII, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.
How We Use the Information Collected
Providing Services: We use the information we gather on our Website for the purposes of providing the services or advertisement you have requested. This may include passing your information on to a third party who we have a contract to provide such services. Although our contractual arrangement limits how such third party can use your information, we do not control the privacy practices of this third party. If you have any questions or wish to remove your information from the third party’s database, you will need to contact that party directly.
