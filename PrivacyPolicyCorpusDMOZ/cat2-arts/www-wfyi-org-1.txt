WFYI’s Commitment to Donor Privacy
To comply with Corporation for Public Broadcasting policy, WFYI Public Media:
Maintains active control of donor lists and takes appropriate measures to ensure against unauthorized use of such lists by any third party.
Will not sell, rent, lease, trade, give, donate, transfer or exchange donor names to, with or from any candidate for Federal, State or local office, political committees, or political parties unless required by law or judicial process.
Will not disclose donor names or other personally identifiable information to any nonaffiliated third party unless it first discloses to donors that such information may be disclosed.
Will give the donor the opportunity to direct that the information not be disclosed, along with an explanation of how to exercise that nondisclosure option, unless the disclosure is required by law or judicial process.
