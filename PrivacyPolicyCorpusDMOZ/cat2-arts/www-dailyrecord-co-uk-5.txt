Split it over paydays A typical household spends an extra £800 a month during December and with most people only having two or maybe three paydays left, splitting the cost may ease the financial pressure. If you set a budget and look to split this over your remaining paydays, you may not feel the burden as much just before Christmas. For example, taking £50 out of your pay packet for the next 3 months is an easy £150 to put aside for presents. If this isn't enough, look more towards the future. Every month set aside £50 for 11 months, which means you will have an extra £550 for Christmas in 2021. Save on food costs We’ve all been there, the Christmas Eve food panic - but think about what you’ll need in advance, have a shop around and see which supermarkets are doing the best value products. Items with a longer shelf-life such as festive chocolate and mince pies are much cheaper in the run-up to Christmas, so get buying now if you can - you could save more than you think and be prepped for those after-dinner snacks.
Try micro-saving You can still use micro-saving techniques to save that extra bit of cash in time for Christmas. If you’re a fan of high-street coffee and seasonal sandwiches while out doing a shop, the costs of these expensive treats quickly rack up. Cut them out and keep the cash for Christmas spends instead. Regifting Controversial or not, there’s nothing wrong with regifting presents if money is tight this year. Having a sort out and finding things that would be good to regift could save you buying those last-minute corner shop gifts for your partner’s workmates, or a distant relative. If you can keep things aside throughout the year for this, you’ll save on excess when it comes to Christmas. Reassess your usual Christmas spends Unfortunately, this year it looks like that new Christmas party dress and a trip to Winter Wonderland is off the cards. Think about how much you usually would have budgeted for these events, and put it away in an account either to put towards gifts or food or just to save - you’d be surprised how much we spend in the run-up to Christmas as well as the big day itself. However much you plan to spend on Christmas this year, just remember to stick to your budget and not leave yourself short and unable to pay essentials including household bills - no gift is worth getting yourself into debt.
