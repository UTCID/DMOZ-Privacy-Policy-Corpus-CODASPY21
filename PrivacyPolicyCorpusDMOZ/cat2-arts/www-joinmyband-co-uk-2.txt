×Coronavirus (Covid-19): We would like to take this opportunity to send our thoughts to all our Join My Band users. We urge you all to stay at home and stay safe; make plans for the future when all of this has passed. Take this time to write more music and maybe work on an online/virtual collaboration with someone in another part of the country you may not have otherwise jammed with. But please follow government advice, stay at home and stay safe.
