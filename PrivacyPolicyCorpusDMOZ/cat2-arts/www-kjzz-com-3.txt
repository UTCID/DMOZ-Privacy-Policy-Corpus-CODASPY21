Pete Sands, a public relations specialist for Utah Navajo Health System, said in a news release:The unemployment rate and the infrastructure on the Navajo reservation is not that great, so you put COVID on top of that and it just decimated everything,” said Sands. “We don't have heaters, we don’t have central cooling systems on the reservation, a lot of the homes here depend on firewood for food.In response to their need, piles of wood from storm-ridden areas were collected and dropped off at 42 Church-owned properties and local entities, including the Urban Indian Center of Salt Lake.Colin Kaepernick gets his own Ben & Jerry's flavor called 'Change the Whirled'
