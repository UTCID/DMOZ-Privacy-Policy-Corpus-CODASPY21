WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
The purpose of this notice is to make visitors of ChasingtheFrog.com
aware of our commitment to protect their personal information online.
We also wish to explain how purchasing works through ChasingtheFrog.com.
I. Collection of Personal Information
The only personal information ChasingtheFrog.com obtains about you
is information voluntarily provided by you. This can happen in two ways.
1. Through e-mail we receive when corresponding with visitors. 2. By
posting to our message boards (the online movie forums). This website
does not collect additional information about individual visitors from
other sources. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate
through the website without giving us personal information. To gauge
the effectiveness of our website, we may collect non-personal information
about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser
identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information,
the webpage from which a person enters our website, webpages visited
at our site, duration of visit and domain type. This information does
not reveal a visitor's personal identity.
II. Use of Personal Information
We do not share or disclose your personal information with third
parties.
III. Protection of Personal Information
We require our staff to protect the privacy of all personal information
collected over our website. Only individuals with specific authorization
have access to databases containing visitor's personal information.
The databases are protected in a secure facility.
IV. Purchasing Through ChasingtheFrog.com
We offer a large number of items that can be purchased through certain
websites who we are in association with. We call these companies that
conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "Operational
Providers." These operational providers operate
independently of ChasingtheFrog.com. When you purchase an item, our
Operational Providers will request your personal information to fulfill
your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information
to these Operational Providers, including your order or request, will
be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies.
We do not share your personal information with our providers nor do they
share your personal information with us.
V. Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy
We will review our website privacy practices on a periodic basis,
and we may modify our policies as we deem appropriate. We may also change
or update our website Privacy Policy if we add new services or features
and will post these changes in a revised policy available on our website.
We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy and those of our Operational
Providers (see item IV.) on a regular basis.
