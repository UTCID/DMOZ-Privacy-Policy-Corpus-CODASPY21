PRIVACY POLICY
ESLtown is
committed to protecting your privacy. When we ask information of
you, our primary interest is to provide you with more
personalized service and help create a friendly online community.
We will not sell, rent or trade your name or personal details to
other organizations unless you give us your permission. When we
have your permission, we will occasionally share this
information with select partner organizations who follow our
same high standards. You may instruct us, however, not to share
this information with anyone.
Security measures
ESLtown has established a number of security measures to protect
your privacy while you visit our site. We password protect
important directories. Our sales partners use only secure
servers and encrypt all credit card information. We also provide
password protection for our discussion center to protect the
integrity of your postings.
How we use the information we collect
ESLtown is primarily a free site. You are not required to supply
personal information to use many areas of the site. To provide
some of the educational services available in ESLtown, we
do, however, need to know a few things about you.
