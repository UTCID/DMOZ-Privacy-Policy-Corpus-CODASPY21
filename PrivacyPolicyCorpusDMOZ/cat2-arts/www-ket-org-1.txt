Cookies. A cookie is a small text file sent by a Web server to a Web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the Web server to identify and track the Web browser. A cookie may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. You may be able to set your Web browser to reject cookies entirely or require that it request permission from you before accepting each new cookie. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive once you leave a website.We, and third party service providers, use anonymous cookies to record non-personal data such as Site and Service activity, date and time of visit, domain type, IP address and demographic information (zip codes for example). All data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify the visitor. The information obtained from the cookie may be used in the administration of the Site, tailoring the Site to the interests and locations of the users, measuring traffic within the Site, improving the Site’s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our Site, and to personalize our Site for you. KET may also use the content from cookies to deliver relevant local resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our visitors’ experiences on the Site. KET does not sell information collected by cookies.
We work with advertising partners relating to advertisements on the Services.

We may use vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our websites, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. Google provides tools to manage the collection and use of certain information by Google Analytics at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads Settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads .
Similar Technologies. We, and third party service providers, also use pixel tags and web beacons which are tracking devices on websites or in e-mails that can monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or receiving the e-mail. There is no accepted standard on how to respond to Do Not Track signals, and we do not respond to such signals.
KET may utilize user-behavior information and other non-personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses or demographics like zip codes, to tailor our Site to the interests/locations of our users and to measure traffic within the Site.
