Data Privacy Statement
About
The University of Tennessee at Martin understands and respects a user's concerns about privacy and data collection.
Most websites will gather some information about users or their traffic. The collection of user data can happen
within a wide spectrum of user interactions that happen passively (web servers interaction) and actively (via
forms or interactions with content).
Most information collected is aggregated data and not able to identify a particular individual. While the information
allows site owners to determine who a particular visitor is and to track their behavior within and across a
website domain.
Websites within the University of Tennessee at Martin website domain, utm.edu, likewise collect information regarding
site visitors. This policy outlines the types of information (data) collected, our methods for collecting data,
and the reasons we collect data.
Gathering & Use of Information
The University of Tennessee at Martin (UTM) automatically collects information from individuals or entities when
they access any UTM website. Information that is collected from this contact includes the visitor’s IP address,
the URL of the website from which the visitor linked directly to UTM’s website, the date and time of the website
access, and the web pages(s) visited. In addition, UTM may also collect any information that it receives from
your web browser, including browser type, version, and operating system. This information helps us understand
aggregate uses of our site, track usage trends, and improve our services.
Security
The University of Tennessee at Martin is committed to ensuring the security of your information. We have put
in place reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access
to or use of the information collected online.
Aggregate Information
The following are examples of information that may be collected in aggregate to provide campus communicators,
site owners, content managers, designers, and IT specialists insight into visitor behavior for the purpose
of improving university websites and access to university information.
The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer and name of the Internet domain used to access the Internet;
IP addresses of websites linking directly to sites within the utm.edu domain;
The date and time a site was accessed within the utm.edu domain;
Pages visited ("requested”) during this session;
Web browser and operating system used to access a site within the utm.edu domain;
Device used to access a site within the utm.edu domain.
University of Tennessee websites commonly use one of the following methods to collect this data:
Cookies
Cookies are files that many websites transfer to users’ web browsers to enable the site to deliver personalized
services or to provide persistent authentication. The information contained in a cookie typically includes
information collected automatically by the web server and/or information provided voluntarily by the user.
Our website uses persistent cookies in conjunction with a third party technology partner to analyze search
engine usage and web traffic patterns. This information is used in the aggregate to monitor and enhance
our web pages. It is not used to track the usage patterns of individual users.
Third-party Tracking (e.g. Google Analytics)
Many websites within the tennessee.edu domain use Google Analytics to collect visitor data in aggregate. This data is also collected using cookies set by Google. See Google’s privacy and terms with regard to partner sites for more info: google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
The University of Tennessee, Martin, may also transmit non-Personally identifiable information (NPII) collected by third-party tracking services (cookies) to other third parties (e.g. Facebook) so that you may see messages from the university when you visit other websites outside of the tennessee.edu domain.
Users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by blocking third party cookies and tracking mechanisms via browser or operating system settings, browser plugins, or using a service such as aboutads.info/choices or youronlinechoices.eu/.
Server logs
All web servers collect very basic visitor information to monitor site usage and performance.

Date of high school graduation
The university may also collect personal information about you from third parties, including trusted vendors,

materials requests, to contact you, or to display web content that may be of particular interest to you.
