We may also record your IP address and any communications addressed to us via email, or the online support portal. We use these records to process billing and technical support for services provided to you. From time to time we will also use this information to notify you of new products or offerings as well as communicate any new discounts or changes in your services. We share limited information with companies who conduct analytical and marketing suppression, such as Google and Facebook, this helps us understand how people are using our website and services.

A user may access and update their information by logging into our client portal located at https://jethostpro.com/clients. For any questions or concerns you may contact our billing department by emailing admin@jethostpro.com.
Opt Out Clause
If you wish to opt out of any non-essential emails, such as notices of new products or services you may contract us with this request via email to admin@jethostpro.com.
Scope of Service
JetHost PRO services are limited to the operation and management of servers to provide web hosting and email hosting, along with ancillary products and services. We will do our best at all times to keep your servers online and accessible.
We do not take responsibility for the safe keeping of your data, although we do take reasonable steps in this regard for you. To be sure, you should take periodic backups of your site and email, just in case.
Backups
JetHost PRO takes a daily backup of your website files and your databases.
These are retained for a rolling 30 day period, and are available within your control panel for restoration or downloading. We also take a rolling 1 day backup of your email accounts. These backups are kept on-site in our data facility.
In addition to this, we take a weekly off-site copy of your websites files and databases (not email) for restoration in cases of disaster. You can take a backup of your website files and databases inside your control panel, and we recommend you do this at least once a month for your own peace of mind.
We also strongly recommend, if your email is vital to you, that you back up your email accounts on a regular basis, using something like the free or paid versions of MailStore, available at their site: www.mailstore.com/en/products/mailstore-home or collect and process your emails through a webmail system such as Google G Suite.
Support
Support is offered on a best-efforts basis. We will do our best to help you where we can. We are generally unable to support third party email and other software due to the sheer numbers of different software programs and versions of each. We’ll still do our best for you though.
Complaints and Dispute Resolution
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of any complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you can also submit your complaint to arbitration.
Data Retention
JetHost PRO will retain your information for a minimum of the period of time required by law. After you no longer have active services your account information is deleted in accordance with this.
Merger or Acquisition
In the event of a merger or acquisition all personal data and information will be transferred to the new entity.
