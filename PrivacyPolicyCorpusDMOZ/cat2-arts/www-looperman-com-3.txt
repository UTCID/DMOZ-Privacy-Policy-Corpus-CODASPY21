Cookie Policy
Our cookie policy is part of our privacy policy. Please also see our terms and conditions.
As with virtually all websites and aps we and the third party services providers we use
may make use of cookies and other similar technologies for storing
information when you visit or interact with the platform. These can
be used for example, to remember your preferences, target ads, manage
your access to or secure the platform.
Our cookie policy tries to explain why and how we use them and how you can manage their use.
What are cookies
Cookies are small text files stored by and read from your browser. Session cookies are
used to track your current visit and expire when you close the
browser. Persistent cookies are used to store your preferences. For
example if you choose “remember me” at login a persistent
cookie is set to save you from having to log in again the next time

How we use cookies
We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below;
Required cookies :
These are cookies that are required for the
functionality of the platform. For example we use cookies when you

spam or other unauthorised activities.
Analytical / performance cookies: These are cookies that allow us to see
things like the number of visitors using the platform, the pages
they are visiting and their movements across the platform. These
allow us to maintain and monitor the platform.
Functional cookies :
These allow us to do things like recognise you when you
return if you have chosen to be remembered at login and tailor
content to your preference and in some cases personalise the
experience.
Personalisation / cookies :
Where this site offers newsletter or email subscription
services cookies may be used to remember if you are already
registered and whether to show certain notifications which might
only be valid to subscribed/unsubscribed users. From time to time we
may offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with
interesting insights, helpful tools, or to understand our user base
more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember who has
already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate
results after you change pages.

For the most part these cookies are set by our third
party advertising services. See third party cookies section.

Do not track signals
Some browsers allow the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals.
Unfortunately there is no clear standard for the adoption of these and so at the moment we do not process them or respond to them. We
will keep a watch on this though and when the times comes implement them too.
