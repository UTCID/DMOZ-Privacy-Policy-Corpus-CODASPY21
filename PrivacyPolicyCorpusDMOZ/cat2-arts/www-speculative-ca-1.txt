ads in different sections of our website.
We also monitor information so that we can produce aggregate reports
for internal use - and for use by third parties, including
speculative.ca advertisers. Aggregate reports are mostly
statistical and deal with information like people behavior and number
of total visits and page views not about individual behavior.
