How many files can I store?
If you have "Smurf" status on our shared community message boards, you can store up to two hundred files! A "Smurf" is someone who has posted at least 20 messages or replies. Newbies need not worry though - "Smurflings" (users who have made less than 20 posts) can still store up to fifty files, and that's nothing to smurf at!

Feel free to upload Smurf related pictures and files. Just make sure they're family friendly & legal. Users who abuse their upload privileges will have them revoked. The filename extensions our upload servers support are: .zip, .txt, .tar, .png, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .mpg, .mpeg, .avi, .wmv, .wav, .wma and .mp3.
