ESP Quick Facts
ESP Origins
In the early 1990's,
Robert Robbins
was a faculty member at Johns
Hopkins, where he directed the informatics core of GDB
— the human gene-mapping database of the international human
genome project. To share papers with colleagues around the world, he
set up a small paper-sharing section on his personal web page. This
small project evolved into The Electronic Scholarly
Publishing Project.
ESP Support
In 1995, Robbins became the VP/IT of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, WA. Soon after arriving in Seattle, Robbins secured
funding, through the ELSI component of the US Human Genome Project, to
create the original ESP.ORG web site, with the formal goal of
providing free, world-wide access to the literature of classical genetics.
ESP Rationale
Although the methods of molecular biology can seem almost
magical to the uninitiated, the original
techniques of classical genetics are readily appreciated by one and
all: cross individuals that differ in some inherited trait, collect
all of the progeny, score their attributes, and propose mechanisms
to explain the patterns of inheritance observed.
ESP Goal
In reading the early works of classical genetics, one is drawn, almost
inexorably, into ever more complex models, until molecular explanations
begin to seem both necessary and natural. At that point, the tools
for understanding genome research are at hand. Assisting readers reach
this point was the original goal of The Electronic Scholarly Publishing
Project.
ESP Usage
Usage of the site grew rapidly and has remained high. Faculty began
to use the site for their assigned readings. Other on-line
publishers, ranging from The New York Times to Nature
referenced ESP materials in their own publications. Nobel laureates
(e.g., Joshua Lederberg) regularly used the
site and even wrote to suggest changes and improvements.
ESP Content
When the site began, no journals
were making their early content available in
digital format. As a result, ESP was obliged to digitize classic
literature before it could be made available. For many important
papers — such as
Mendel's original paper
or the
first genetic map
— ESP had to produce entirely new typeset versions of the works,
if they were to be available in a high-quality format.
ESP Help
Early support from the DOE component of the Human Genome Project was
critically important for getting the ESP project on a firm foundation.
Since that funding ended (nearly 20 years ago), the project has been
operated as a purely volunteer effort.
Anyone wishing to assist in these efforts should send an
email to Robbins.
ESP Plans
With the development of methods for
adding typeset
side notes to PDF files, the ESP project now
plans to add annotated versions of some classical papers to
its holdings. We also plan to add
new reference and pedagogical material.
We have already started providing
regularly updated, comprehensive
bibliographies
to the ESP.ORG site.

ESP FEATURES
Papers in Classical Genetics
The ESP began as an effort to share a handful of key papers
from the early days of classical genetics. Now the collection
has grown to include hundreds of papers, in full-text format.
Digital Books
Along with papers on classical genetics, ESP offers a collection
of full-text digital books, including many works by Darwin (and
even a collection of poetry —
Chicago Poems by Carl Sandburg).
Timelines
ESP now offers a much improved and expanded collection of timelines,
designed to give the user choice over subject matter and dates.
Biographies
Biographical information about many key scientists.
Selected Bibliographies
Bibliographies on several topics of potential
interest to the ESP community are now being
automatically maintained and generated on the ESP site.
