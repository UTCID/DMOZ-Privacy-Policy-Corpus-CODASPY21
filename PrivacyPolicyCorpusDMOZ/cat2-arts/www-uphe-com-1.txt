(b)     Terms of Wireless Features.  You agree that as to the Wireless Features for which you are registered for, we may send communications to your wireless Device regarding us or other parties.  Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features.  If you have registered via the Online Services for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify UPHE of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on the Online Services to reflect the changes.
(c)     Location-Based Features.  For Online Services on mobile Devices ("Mobile Apps") when you use one of our location-enabled services, you agree that we may collect and process information about your actual location and share such information with third parties (e.g., our service providers). Some of the Mobile Apps or Online Services require your location information for the feature to function. If you have enabled GPS, geo-location or other location-based features on a Device, you acknowledge that you consent to your Device location being tracked and this information potentially being shared with others consistent with the Privacy Policy.
In addition, where any UPHE Mobile App collects precise information about the location of your Devices, it will be used to provide requested location services, and, depending on the particular Mobile App it may be used, among other uses, to allow tagging or to check-in.

The social network directly transmits the content of the plug-in to your browser. If you are registered on the relevant social network and logged into your respective account the social network receives the information that the web page was used by you. If you interact with a social network plug-in (e.g., you press the Facebook "Like" feature, the Twitter "Tweet this" feature, the Google Plus "+1" button or equivalent) or leave a comment on the relevant web page, the corresponding information is directly transmitted to the relevant social network from your browser. If you are not registered with the social network or you are logged out before you visit our Online Services, there is the possibility that at least your IP address will be submitted to and stored by the social network. If you interact with us through a social media platform, plug-in, etc., then you may be permitting us to have ongoing access to certain limited information from your social network profile (such as your name, social networking ID page, email address, photo, gender, location, the people/websites you follow, etc.).
If you don't want the social network to collect the information about you described above, or to share it with us and other third parties, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log-out of the relevant social network before you visit our Online Services. As with other sites, you may be able delete any existing cookies placed on your computer by the social network via your browser.  See Section 2 of our Privacy Policy to find out more about how our Sites and Online Services contain plug-ins to social media networks.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES, THE UPHE PARTIES' LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH JURISDICTION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THE DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  THIS PROVISION WILL ONLY APPLY IF AN ARBITRATOR WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.

27.         Export Control
Unless otherwise specified, the Content on the Online Services is presented solely to provide information regarding and to promote UPHE's services and other products available in the U.S. The Online Services are controlled and operated by UPHE from its offices within the State of New York.

28.         Binding Arbitration of All Disputes.  No Class Relief.
This Section 28 is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  You and UPHE agree that we intend that this Section 28 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section 28 can only be amended by mutual agreement. For non-U.S. residents, if binding arbitration is adjudged by a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of Section 29 shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and us.
We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.  Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Use, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Sites or other Online Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with UPHE, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to UPHE or that UPHE may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, "UPHE Transactions or Relationships"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.  By using or interacting with the Sites or other Online Services, or engaging in any other UPHE Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.  If those efforts fail, by using our Sites or other Online Services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against UPHE, and any claim that UPHE may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, or any UPHE Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds US$100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.  If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances).  If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, UPHE agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 28, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.  Furthermore, this Section 28 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  You further agree that:
(a)     Single Arbitrator.  The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and UPHE (the "Arbitrator");
(b)     Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.  The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use and/or these arbitration provisions in Section 28 hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable;
(c)     Location of Arbitration.  The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and UPHE; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than US$10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.
(d)     Governing Law.  The Arbitrator (i) shall apply the internal laws of the State of California consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
(e)     No Class Relief.  The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or UPHE 's individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
(f)     Written Award.  The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award"). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
(g)     Arbitration Costs.  In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, UPHE will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
(h)     Reasonable Attorney's Fees.  In the event you recover an Award greater than UPHE 's last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award UPHE 's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the Arbitration, but UPHE shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees; and
(i)     Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause.  With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor UPHE shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(j)     Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice.  UPHE may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after UPHE has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from UPHE Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.
(k)     Small Claims Matters are Excluded.  No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.  Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against UPHE in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.
(l)     Injunctive Relief.  The foregoing provisions of this Section 28 will not apply to any legal action taken by UPHE to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Online Services, any Content, your User Content and/or UPHE's intellectual property rights (including such rights that UPHE may claim may be in dispute), UPHE's operations, and/or UPHE's products or services.
29.         Dispute Resolution for Non-US Residents Only if a Tribunal has Ruled that Arbitration is Prohibited by Law
This Section 29 applies to non-US Residents, where applicable law prohibits arbitration of disputes in accordance with Section 28.
(a)     Section 29 disputes.  If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Online Services, the Content, these Terms of Use, whether heretofore or hereafter arising or to any of UPHE's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (collectively, a "Section 29 Dispute"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 29 Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 29(a).  Your notice to us must be sent to:
By mail: Universal Pictures Home Entertainment  c/o CT Corporation 818 W 7th Street #200 Los Angeles, CA  90017
AND
Senior Vice President Litigation  NBCUniversal 100 Universal City Plaza Universal City, CA  91608 By e-mail: upheclaims@nbcuni.com    For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, UPHE and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 29 Dispute, though nothing will require either you or UPHE to resolve the Section 29 Dispute on terms with respect to which you and UPHE, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
(b)     Jurisdiction. The parties agree that the state or federal courts in New York shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 29 Dispute.
(c)    Governing Law.  To the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms of Use and any Section 29 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the U.S. and the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
(d)   Limited Time to File Claims.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A SECTION 29 DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 29(a)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE SECTION 29 DISPUTE ARISING - OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
(e)     Injunctive Relief.  The foregoing provisions of this Section 29 will not apply to any legal action taken by UPHE to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Online Services, any Content, your User Content and/or UPHE's intellectual property rights (including such rights that UPHE may claim may be in dispute), UPHE's operations, and/or UPHE's products or services.

These UPHE.com/Redeem additional terms apply to the Redemption Site ("UPHE.com/Redeem ADDITIONAL TERMS") and supplement the UPHE Terms of Use in accordance with Section 1 therein.  These UPHE.com/Redeem ADDITIONAL TERMS apply to the Redemption Site.   Unless otherwise indicated here, all defined terms are as used in the UPHE Terms of Use.  UPHE maintains the Redemption Site for purposes of (a) registering UPHE Blu-ray™ disc owners and/or users to provide them with access to BD-Live™ features and offerings via the BD-Live™ Center ("BD-Live™ Center") and/or pocket BLU™; (b) registering UPHE Blu-ray™ disc and DVD owners and/or users to provide them with access to Digital Copy features and offerings; (c) allowing such UPHE Blu-ray™ disc and DVD owners and/or users to update their preferences; and (d) additional marketing and customer service purposes.
ULTRAVIOLET UPDATE: UPHE previously registered UPHE Blu-ray™ disc and DVD owners and/or users to provide them with access to UltraViolet™ features and offerings. However, UltraViolet ceased operations on July 31, 2019. Your UltraViolet library is now closed, but you may continue to make electronic purchases and redeem any unexpired digital code offers included in packaged media from retailers.

ADDITIONAL TERMS Re: Acceptance of Terms of Use
Pursuant to Section 1 of the UPHE Terms of Use, these UPHE.com/Redeem ADDITIONAL TERMS cover the following services:
Buddies.  We may offer you the ability to interact with other users who own the same UPHE Blu-ray™ disc as you (such users to be referred to as "Buddies") in special features through the BD-Live™ Center. A user who wants to interact may enter another user's email address to facilitate such interaction. Potential Buddies will always receive an invitation to become another user's Buddy, which they may accept or decline. In the event that a Buddy accepts such invitation, we will use that Buddy's email address to facilitate the interaction between the two users on an ongoing basis. If you want to remove a Buddy from your Buddy list and/or remove yourself from a Buddy's Buddy list, you can do so at any time by clicking "Remove" next to the Buddy's name in the "MY BUDDIES" section of your account. Before accepting an invitation to become another user's Buddy, please be aware that you may receive interactive applications and communications from any UPHE Blu-ray™ disc for which you are a registered owner under the applicable username. Pursuant to Section 21 of the UPHE Terms of Use, you may remove your account, at any time and for any reason, by visiting the "MY ACCOUNT" section of the BD-Live™ Center and then selecting the remove button.  Please note that a user's removal of his or her account will not prevent him or her from receiving marketing information from UPHE, NBCUniversal, its affiliates and/or subsidiaries or other service providers on the Site, provided that such user has previously consented to receiving such marketing information.
Digital Copy.  Subject to purchase of an eligible Blu-ray™ disc or DVD that includes a digital code offer to access a digital copy of specified content ("Digital Copy"), you may redeem such digital code offer through Movies Anywhere™, Google Play, or another authorized retailer, platform, or service provider indicated via UPHE.com/Redeem or the insert communicating the offer. Redemption of the digital code offer is available only to residents of the United States and Canada, with the list of authorized retailers, platforms, and service providers through which you can redeem the offer varying by country (for example, redemption via Movies Anywhere™ is currently available only in the United States). This list is subject to change at any time. The digital code offer that accompanies each eligible Blu-ray™ disc or DVD purchase can only be redeemed once.
NOTE: YOU MAY USE DIGITAL CODES TO OBTAIN LICENSED ACCESS TO DIGITAL COPIES ONLY AS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THESE UPHE.COM/REDEEM ADDITIONAL TERMS, THE UPHE.COM DIGITAL COPY FAQs, AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MOVIES ANYWHERE™, GOOGLE PLAY, OR ANY OTHER AUTHORIZED RETAILER, PLATFORM, OR SERVICE PROVIDER. IF YOU DON’T WANT TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, RETURN THE UNOPENED COMBINATION DISC + CODE PACKAGE TO YOUR POINT OF PURCHASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS RETURN POLICY.
IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO OBTAIN YOUR PARENT'S OR LEGAL GUARDIAN'S PERMISSION BEFORE REDEEMING A DIGITAL CODE OFFER. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 16 ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM REDEEMING A DIGITAL CODE OFFER.
Upon your valid redemption of a digital code offer, UPHE grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license to access the Digital Copy via streaming on Authorized Devices (defined below) and to retain a permanent Digital Copy on the Authorized Devices (restrictions apply; subject to terms and conditions of Movies Anywhere™, Google Play, or the authorized retailer, platform, or service provider through which you chose to redeem the digital code offer), and to view the Digital Copy an unlimited number of times so long as any such viewing is for personal, private, non-commercial use only. For purposes of viewing a Digital Copy, "Authorized Devices" shall mean those Internet protocol (“IP”) connected devices (e.g., personal computers, tablets, smart phones, home video disc players, and IP connected televisions) that comply with specific content usage/protection rules and that meet certain minimum system requirements as Movies Anywhere™, Google Play, or the relevant authorized retailer, platform, or service provider may establish in its sole discretion from time to time. You will not be entitled to a refund from UPHE of any portion of the purchase price of your Blu-ray™ disc or DVD if you are unable to access or view your Digital Copy for any reason.
The Digital Copy may be used solely for your personal, private, non-commercial use. You may not copy, reproduce, transfer, download, capture or store in any physical media (except as expressly authorized by UPHE), re-license, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, publish, transmit, distribute, display, broadcast, re-broadcast, redistribute, modify, create derivative works from, market, rent, sell, lease, sublicense, assign any right or license in or to, or participate in any sale of or exploit in any way, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the Digital Copy, any associated content or any related software. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, erase, delete, damage or disable any computer file, software, security technology, copy protection, or usage limitation systems associated with the Digital Copy or the associated content.
You may not: (a) use the Digital Copy or associated content to violate any legal right of any third party, including any publicity or privacy right, copyright or other intellectual property right, or to take any action that is harassing, libelous, defamatory, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful or otherwise objectionable; and (b) counterfeit or paste the Digital Copy or any associated content to any web site or web page. In addition, you agree that you will not attempt to, or encourage or assist any other person to, violate the UPHE Terms of Use, these UPHE.com/Redeem Additional Terms, or the terms and conditions of Movies Anywhere™, Google Play, or the authorized retailer, platform, or service provider through which you chose to redeem the digital code offer. Any third-party owners of the specified content contained in a Digital Copy or any associated content are expressly made third-party beneficiaries of each of the license and use restrictions set forth in this Section and elsewhere in these UPHE.com/Redeem Additional Terms.
If you choose to redeem your Digital Copy via Movies Anywhere™, then your use of the Digital Copy on the Movies Anywhere service and on the Movies Anywhere Authorized Devices, and any information you provide in connection therewith, shall be governed by the Movies Anywhere Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (which can be viewed at https://moviesanywhere.com/terms-of-use and https://moviesanywhere.com/privacy-policy), subject to your continuing obligations and UPHE’s continuing rights with respect to the Digital Copy and associated content as provided herein. If you choose to redeem your Digital Copy via Google Play, then your use of the Digital Copy on Google Play and on the Google Play Authorized Devices, and any information you provide in connection therewith, shall be governed by the Google Play Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (which can be viewed at https://play.google.com/intl/en_ca/about/play-terms/index.html and https://policies.google.com/privacy), subject to your continuing obligations and UPHE’s continuing rights with respect to the Digital Copy and associated content as provided herein. If you choose to redeem your Digital Copy with any other authorized retailer, platform, or service provider, please note that your redemption and use of the Digital Copy shall be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of such other retailer, platform, or service provider, as well as your continuing obligations and UPHE’s continuing rights with respect to the Digital Copy and associated content as provided herein.
UPHE DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR ACCESS TO, TRANSFER, STORAGE AND/OR USE OF THE DIGITAL COPY WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

Any capabilities to transfer, export and/or store the Digital Copy as permitted hereunder are solely an accommodation to you and shall not constitute a grant or waiver of any rights of UPHE (or any other copyright owners, as applicable) in any of its content, or that of any third party.
