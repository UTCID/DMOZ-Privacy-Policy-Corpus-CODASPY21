(v) we will then send you an initial acknowledgment; and
(vi) once we have checked whether we are able to meet your order, we will either send you an order confirmation (at which point your order will become a binding contract) or we will confirm by email that we are unable to meet your order. We will not file a copy of these conditions of sale specifically in relation to your order. We may update the version of these conditions of sale on the website from time to time, and we do not guarantee that the version you have agreed to will remain accessible.
