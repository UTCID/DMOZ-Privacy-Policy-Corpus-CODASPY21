What is the PRIVACY Forum?
The PRIVACY Forum includes e-mailed messages
and
associated materials (along with an archive including some of these
items) for the discussion and analysis of issues relating to privacy
(both personal and collective) in the information age. Topics include
telecommunications, information and database collection and sharing,
and a wide range of other privacy issues, as pertains to the privacy
concerns of individuals, groups, businesses, government, and society at
large. The manners in which both the conventional and the controversial
concerns of business and government interact with privacy
considerations are also relevant topics.
There is no charge to receive any of these materials.
The PRIVACY Forum is supported in part by
the ACM (Association for
Computing Machinery)
Committee on Computers and Public Policy and Telos Systems. These organizations do
not operate or control the PRIVACY Forum in any manner, and their
support does not imply agreement on their part with nor responsibility
for any materials posted on or related to the PRIVACY Forum.
The goal of PRIVACY Forum is to present a useful resource for
both
individuals and organizations.
All messages and other items represent the views of their
individual
authors.
