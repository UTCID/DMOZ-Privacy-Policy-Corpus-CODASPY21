Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. The only personal information this site will ask for is your email address,
used as your login. Your email address will not be shown to anyone on the site, nor will it ever be sold or
otherwise transferred to any third party.
Periodically, we may send an email to all registered users of the site. Any such email will have a subject line
prefixed with [FIFDB] for your easy identification, and will be strictly limited to notifications about significant
changes or new features of the site. Under no circumstances will any commercial email originate from this site.
Passwords are stored encrypted with a one-way hash function, so that not even the site administrator ever has access
to the plain text.
