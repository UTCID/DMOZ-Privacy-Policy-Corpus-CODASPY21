Violation of United States and International Law:
Content and products purchased, downloaded, and/or viewed on ceramicartsnetwork.org (and related sites) are intended for the private, individual use of the purchaser. At no time, without written consent from the American Ceramic Society, should the content, videos, books, and downloadable products be used, broadcast, displayed, or retransmitted (including forwarding via email or FTP) in a public forum, online or otherwise. Failure to abide by these regulations constitutes an international copyright infringement, a violation of international intellectual property law, and a violation of US Federal Communications Commission regulations. Violators will be prosecuted.
CeramicArtsNework.org reserves the right to cancel any order(s) or account(s). Refunds will be issued for any undelivered products.
Return Policy:
Sales of all downloaded products (books, magazines, videos) are final. Books and DVDs purchased from this site can be returned for a full refund of the purchase price within 30 days of purchase only if it is determined that the product(s) was damaged. Shipping expenses will not be refunded. A returned item will only be replaced once it has been returned to our warehouse and it has been determined by our staff that the product was damaged.
Promotions:
We may, from time-to-time, run promotions and discount events. These may take the form of site-wide sales or product-specific sales. The particular form of promotion will be described, and full details set out, in the communications (such as e-mails, social media, and ads). The period of time during which each promotion will run (“promotion period”) will be specified in the promotion. Each promotion will automatically close at the end of the relevant promotion period, at which point no further participation in that promotion will be possible.
