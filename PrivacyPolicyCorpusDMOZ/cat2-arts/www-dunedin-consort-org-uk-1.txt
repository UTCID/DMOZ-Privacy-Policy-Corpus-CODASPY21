If you decide to purchase any tracks or albums you will be required to provide credit card and personal billing information. Any information you do provide will be used for market research purposes at Dunedin Consort only. We want to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide a more valuable service.  We also collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our website services are of most interest to them.Dunedin Consort also enables you to send “e-vouchers” or purchase gift certificates for family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfil your request, Dunedin Consort may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, postal address and email address. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it is collected.If you submit information on album recommendations you should be aware that this information will be visible to other customers. From time to time Dunedin Consort may hold competitions or prize draws, as part of which we may request contact information from you when you enter. If you are a winner, we will notify you and display your first name and city on our news boards and newsletters announcing the winners.We may occasionally ask you to participate in voluntary surveys. These surveys are intended to improve your service experience. Any personally identifying information collected will be used only by Dunedin Consort unless we specify otherwise. However, we may share aggregate survey result information with others.Controllers of Personal Information.Any personal information gathered by Dunedin Consort is controlled primarily by Dunedin Consort of 77 Montgomery Street, Edinburgh, EH7 5HZ.

You understand and agree that any material downloaded from the site is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your computer system or loss of data that may result from any such material.Collection and Use of Personal Information About CustomersThe information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience at Dunedin Consort. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.Here are the types of information we gather.Information you give us: we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information that will mean that you might not be able to take advantage certain site features.Automatic information: we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Dunedin Consort. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. We will not be able to provide you with a personalised experience at Dunedin Consort if we cannot recognise you, but we want you to be aware that these tools exist.E-mail communications: to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Dunedin Consort if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your registration detailsInformation from other sources: we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described here and subject to this Privacy Notice, to the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications.How we use Cookies and other automatic tracking systemsCookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise you.The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.You can always choose not to provide information and not to accept Cookies, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of certain site features.As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exiting pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.We use this information which does not track individual users, to analyse trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Dunedin Consort will not use the information collected in this way to market directly to that person.In some of our email messages we use “click-through URLs” linked to content on www.dunedin-consort.org.uk. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of customer communications.AgentsWe occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998.Business transfersAs we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Dunedin Consort or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.Protection of Dunedin Consort and othersWe release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements or to protect the rights, property or safety of Dunedin Consort, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice. With your consent, other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK’s Data Protection Act.How Secure Is Information About Me?We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. To purchase from Dunedin Consort you must use an SSL enabled browser, for example, version 3.0 or higher of Internet Explorer. We reveal only the last few digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information.
