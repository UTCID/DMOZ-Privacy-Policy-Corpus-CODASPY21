He’s best known for appearing in front of the cameras in hit sci-fi show Torchwood. But his not inconsiderable CV boasts a history of singing, dancing and TV presenting. Now the 41-year-old star has turned his hand to comic book writing – and penned a 15-page strip starring the programme’s Captain Jack character. Some of the artwork that will appear in the strip The Selkie, printed in this month’s Torchwood magazine has now been revealed. providing a sneak peek of the comic’s content and style. The story sees Jack arriving on the Orkneys’ Seal Island where men’s bodies are being washed up drained of blood. As he investigates the slayings he finds he is himself entwined in the mystery. Barrowman hinted readers would see a compassionate character riddled with guilt – who’s pretty handy at defending himself with a harpoon. Torchwood magazine hadn’t planned on a comic strip until the Scottish-born thespian approached them with artists Tommy Lee Edwards and Trevor Goring – who he met at a comic convention in San Diego. Barrowman, who lives in Sully, said: “Trevor and Tommy thought a collaboration sounded like a great idea, and on the way home from Comic Con I knew that if we didn’t pursue the idea of the four of us working together right away, we’d all get busy with our individual work and it would never happen.” Barrowman is a long standing comic fan who grew up reading Superman, Spiderman, Batman and Captain America. He said: “I don’t think Torchwood magazine expected a comic strip but given that we’d just hooked up with two of the best artists in the comic world, as far as I was concerned, it made sense to pitch a comic.” Later he remembered brainstorming with his sister about the “myth of the Selkie”. He said: “I thought it’d be a perfect plot to adapt for what, in my head, I was already calling a Captain Jack Tale.” Initially his sister’s story had nothing to do with Torchwood. “We worked that out between us,” he said. “ I’d always wanted to do something that put Jack in Scotland and (my sister’s) original story was set on an island off the Orkneys.” He added: “We’d already agreed to tell a story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn’t been explored too much in other media. I wanted to give fans something original about Jack.” Barrowman and his sister came up with the idea for a comic while the pair were working on his autobiography Anything Goes. The pair had wanted to do one since reading Neil Gaiman’s Marvel 1602. That was an eight-issue series published between November 2003 and June 2004 that saw superheroes living in Elizabethan England. The pair say the finished product is better than they could have hoped. Carol said: “When Tommy and Trevor sent the first coloured panels, I just stared at them in stunned admiration.” Her brother went on: “I’m astonished. It’s brilliant work. “The panels with the Selkie are completely breathtaking. “And Jack looks so damn good!” Torchwood magazine editor Martin Eden was over the moon the one-off piece was finished in time. Work only started in December. He said: “The actual mystery does tie in to his own background because when he investigates the murders he starts to realise that it is not unrelated to his own life. It’s to do with his past.” Kristian Barry, who owns Cardiff shop Comic Guru Presents, welcomed Barrowman’s stab at comic books. He said: “Anything that gets people reading comics is a good thing. I see no reason why someone who plays the part could not have a damn good go at writing it too.” He thought the artwork “realistic and edgy”, adding: “I run a Doctor Who specialist shop remember, so I’m sure it will lead to a large increase in website sales. That’s what tends to happen.” Torchwood magazine, issue 14 is on sale on February19WalesOnlineFollow @WalesOnlineMore OnBarryCardiffDoctor Who
