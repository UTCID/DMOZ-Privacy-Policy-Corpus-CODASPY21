19.1. This Agreement or any other agreement between you and Price4Limo or any provision of any such agreement; our relationship with you; the validity of this Agreement or any other agreement between you and Price4Limo or any provisions of any such agreement; will be submitted for arbitration to the office of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County, Florida or such nearest location. Such arbitration proceedings will be conducted in such office, except as otherwise provided in this agreement, and will be heard by one arbitrator in accordance with the then current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. All matters relating to arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et. seq.) and not by any state arbitration law.
19.2
The arbitrator will have the right to award or include in his award any relief which he deems proper in the circumstances, including, without limitation, money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the date due), specific performance, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees and costs, provided that the arbitrator will not have the right to declare any Marks generic or otherwise invalid or, except as otherwise provided, to award exemplary or punitive damages. The award and decision of the arbitrator will be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
19.3
Price4Limo and you agree to be bound by the provisions of any limitation on the period of time in which claims must be brought under applicable law or this Agreement, whichever expires earlier. Price4Limo
and you further agree that, in connection with any such arbitration proceeding, each must submit or file any claim which would constitute a compulsory counterclaim (as defined by Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Procedure) within the same proceeding as the claim to which it relates. Any such claim which is not submitted or filed as described above will be forever barred.
19.4
CLASS ACTION WAIVER: Arbitration shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others. The arbitrator's authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to Claims between you and Price4Limo alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions (including the “Continuation” provision below), and without waiving either party's right of appeal, if any portion of this “Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions” provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) shall not apply. Price4Limo and you agree that an arbitration proceeding between Price4Limo and our shareholders, officers, directors, agents and employees and you (and/or your owners, guarantors, affiliates and employees, if applicable) may not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding between Price4Limo and any other person, corporation or partnership.

19.6
The provisions of this Article are intended to benefit and bind certain of your third party non-signatories and will continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
20. GOVERNING LAW.
All matters relating to arbitration will be governed by the FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (9 U.S.C. 1 et. seq.). Except to the extent governed by the Federal Arbitration Act as required hereby, the UNITED STATES TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946 (LANHAM ACT, 15 U.S.C. 1051 et. seq.) or other federal law, this Agreement, and all claims arising from the relationship between Price4Limo and you will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, except that any law regulating the sale of franchises or governing the relationship of a franchisor and its franchisee will not apply unless jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Article.
21. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.
Subject to Article 25.12. hereof, you and your owners agree that Price4Limo may institute any action against you or your owners in any state or federal court of general jurisdiction in Palm Beach County, Florida, and you (and each owner) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection you (or her or she) may have to either the jurisdiction of or venue in such courts for the purpose of confirming any such arbitration award and/or enforcement thereof.
22. WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND JURY TRIAL.
Except with respect to your obligation to indemnify Price4Limo, in the Agreement, hereof and claims Price4Limo bring against you for your unauthorized use of the Marks or unauthorized use or disclosure of any confidential information, Price4Limo and you and your respective owners waive to the fullest extent permitted by law any right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that, in the event of a dispute between Price4Limo, the party making a claim will be limited to equitable relief and to recovery of any actual damages it sustains.

23. COVID-19 DISCLAIMER AND INDEMNIFICATION.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unexpected and profound impact on all of our daily lives and our businesses. While much uncertainty and apprehension around COVID-19 remains, we do know that COVID-19 is extremely contagious and is believed to spread mainly from person-to-person contact. It may also spread by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Some evidence suggests that COVID-19 can live on certain surfaces for several days. There is a risk that you could contract COVID-19 while using our services and/or entering any of our affiliate’s vehicles or coming into contact with any driver, passenger, or any other person(s) as part of the usage of ours and/or our affiliates’ services.
None of the information provided herein is intended as medical advice. This Notice and Disclaimer is intended as a warning to our customers and users of the risk of contracting COVID-19, and a full and complete disclaimer of our liability. To the extent any claim is brought against us as involving any person or party as a result of being exposed to or contracting COVID-19 you agree to fully indemnify us for all costs and expenses incurred by us, including without limitation any such attorneys fees whether pre-litigation or otherwise.
