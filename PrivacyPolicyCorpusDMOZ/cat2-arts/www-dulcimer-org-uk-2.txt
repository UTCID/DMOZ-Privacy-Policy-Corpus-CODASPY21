Who we are
We are the Nonsuch Dulcimer Club, a charity registered in England and Wales, Registration Number 1184249.
Our website address is: https://www.dulcimer.org.uk.
Nonsuch Dulcimer Club is the data controller (contact details below). This means it decides how your personal data is processed and for what purposes.
Your personal data – what is it?
Personal data relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data.  Identification can be by the information alone or in conjunction with any other information in the data controller’s possession or likely to come into such possession. The processing of personal data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).

Data Collected to Manage Your Membership
At checkout, or when you send us a completed membership form, we will collect your name, email address, (together with username and password if you registered online) and additional information needed to provide your membership service. This information is used to setup your account and to provide our services to you as a member.
If you are redirected to an offsite payment gateway to complete your payment, we may store this information in a temporary session variable to setup your account when you return to our website. Whether you pay via paypal or offline, we record the payment information against your membership account and also in our financial records.

If you borrow an instrument or items from the club library, we keep a record of the loan.
If you are the holder of any club assets, we record your name against the asset.
We use the member information we collect to
Send you our quarterly newsletter; our annual members directory; and, occasionally, other important information about the club by post or email.
Generate the members directory according to your instructions as to how you want your data used.
Keep a record of your payments to us for use in the club financial records, and to send you subscription reminders and renewal information.
Keep a record of any instrument or club library loan and associated details, and manage any rental payments.
Manage club assets
Enable us to provide a voluntary service for the benefit of the public as specified in our constitution; for example we might look for members in an area, or write to members in an area. We don’t pass your details on to members of the public, and will always ask your permission if we think it would be helpful to put them in touch with you.
Keep summary information of the club membership to help us better manage the club
