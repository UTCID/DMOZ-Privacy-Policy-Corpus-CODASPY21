My Privacy Parts
My privacy policy is really very simple. I will never, under any circumstances, sell your info to anybody on the face of the earth. I can’t speak for my affiliates (ie, the banner ads/links to Amazon or other various merchants), because I’m honestly not sure what their policies are. All I know is, I (meaning me, myself, webmaster/head writer/critic/jerk of this website) won’t whore your information. Unless law enforcement agencies force me into giving it to them, but that would mean I’d actually have to collect it. The only way I’ll even get your info is if you send me an email. I could probably go on for about five more paragraphs explaining everything, but I’d like to think my readers are somewhat intelligent and can figure out what I’m saying.
