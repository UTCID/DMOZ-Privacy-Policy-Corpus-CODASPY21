Privacy Policy
Purpose

Information Collected
Two main types of information are collected from visitors to Loyola websites. The first is information that visitors voluntarily supply by various methods such as submitting it into a form on a web page, or by uploading, mailing, or emailing documents to the University or its agents.

Loyola websites also use cookies to add persistence and improve the quality of the user experience.
Various Loyola websites are hosted by the University and by third parties on the University's behalf. Some of these sites may have their own privacy policies. Loyola websites may also contain links to non-Loyola websites. Loyola has no control over and cannot be held responsible for data collected by other websites or how it is used.

These controls include firewalls, encryption, authentication systems, anti-virus software, technical and physical access control, technical and physical monitoring systems, employee background checks, and security policy. While we do our best to maintain secure systems, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
