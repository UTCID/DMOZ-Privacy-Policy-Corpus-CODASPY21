Who are we?
BEET Language Centre is an English language teaching and English language teacher training centre. The teacher training centre operates under the name of ITTC (International Teaching and Training Centre). ITTC is part of BEET, and in this privacy policy is included under the name ‘BEET’.
What information do we collect about you?
We collect information about you when you make an enquiry or enrol with us. We also collect information as part of your stay at the centre – information about your academic progress, your attendance and any disciplinary issues. We also collect information when you complete questionnaires using paper forms or digital tools such as SurveyMonkey. We collect website usage information using cookies. We are the ‘controllers’ of the data we collect: this means it is BEET who decides what to collect, and how to store it and use it, not another organisation. If you have booked your course at BEET with another organisation, they will collect the personal information needed to enrol you at the school, and are also ‘controllers’ of that information.
How will we use the information about you?
We collect information about you to enrol you on your course, manage your course and, if you agree, to email you about other courses and opportunities we think may be of interest to you. We also collect information about exam results and teachers’ assessments to help us assess how well we are meeting the needs of students, and to show our school inspectors.
Who will we share your information with?
If you booked your course at BEET with another organisation, we may share some information with that organisation. If you are aged 16-17 years, we will also inform your parents or legal guardians if we are worried about your welfare or if they ask for reports on your progress. If you were sponsored by an organisation or embassy, we will share with that organisation or embassy any information which is relevant to their sponsorship of your course. We will also share information if we need to respond to requests for information from school inspectors or the UK government.
BEET will not share your information with any organisations other than those above.
Where do we store your information?
Digital information about you is stored in the UK and is encrypted and password-protected. Any paper records are kept in secure locations with access restricted to authorised need-to-know users.
Access to your information and correction
You can ask for a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal information, please email us at the following address admin@beet.co.uk, or write to us at BEET Language Centre, Nortoft Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8PY, England. You will not have to pay for this, unless you make lots of requests. We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think is wrong.
How long we keep your information
We only keep information which we need to manage your course, or which you agree to give us to help us with our publicity. When we no longer need to keep your data, we will remove it. If you would like us to remove data about you and your course, you can contact us at admin@beet.co.uk, but please note that we may need to keep some data for legal reasons or school inspectors.
