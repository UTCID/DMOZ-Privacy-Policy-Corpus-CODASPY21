Notice.

What Personal Information About Customers Does Warren Murphy Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize
and continually improve your shopping experience at Warren Murphy. Here are
the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you
enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to
provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take
advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you
provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing
future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with
you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web
sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when
your Web browser accesses Warren Murphy.
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and
interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
Warren Murphy if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare
our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort
to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not
want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your
Customer Profile.
Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about
you from other sources and add it to our account information.
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to
recognize your browser and to provide features such as 1-Click
purchasing, New for You, personalized Warren Murphy greetings, and storage
of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data
used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the
add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However,
because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Warren Murphy 's
essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For
instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be
able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use
any
Warren Murphy    products and services that require you to Sign in.
Does Warren Murphy Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our
business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We
share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries
Warren Murphy, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy
Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in
this Privacy Notice.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our
affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at
Warren Murphy or sell items to you at Warren Murphy. In other cases, we
provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and
individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail,
removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links
(including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments,
and providing customer service. They have access to personal information
needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of
Warren Murphy customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we
do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to
receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Profile.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might
sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such
transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents
otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Warren Murphy, Inc., or
substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will
of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Warren Murphy   and Others: We release account and other
personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Warren Murphy,
our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information
from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments
set forth in this Privacy Notice.
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive
notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you
will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your information during
transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when
confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to
your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished
using a shared computer.
What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?
Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other
websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer
information to these advertisers or third-party websites.
These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising
companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or
"serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your
browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as
action
tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure
the
effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
We do
not have access to or have control over cookies or other features
that
they may use. The information practices of these advertisers and
third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please
contact them directly for more information about their privacy
practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful
information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad
networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to
opt-out of their information collection.
Warren Murphy may also display targeted advertising based on personal
information about users. Although Warren Murphy does not provide any
personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving
companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a
targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the
ad (for example, users in the northeastern United States who like
country music).
Which Information Can I Access?
Warren Murphy gives you access to a broad range of information
about your account and your interactions with Warren Murphy for the limited
purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
What Choices Do I Have?
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to
take advantage of such Warren Murphy features as your Profile and Customer
Reviews.
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those
listed in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When you
update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our
records.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please
adjust your Customer Profile. (If you do not want to receive Conditions
of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice,
those notices will still govern your use of Warren Murphy, and it is your
responsibility to review them for changes.)
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data
used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the
add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However,
because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Warren Murphy's
essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For
instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be
able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use
any
Warren Murphy   products and services that require you to Sign in.
Are Children Allowed to Use Warren Murphy?
Warren Murphy does not sell products for purchase by children. We
may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under
18, you may use Warren Murphy only with the involvement of a parent or
guardian.
Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions
If you choose to visit Warren Murphy, your visit and any dispute
over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use,
including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
application of the law of the state of Pennsylvania. If you have any
concern about privacy at Warren Murphy, please contact us with a thorough
description, and we will try to resolve it.
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the
Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of
our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but
you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless
stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information
that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises
we
make, however, and will never materially change our policies and
practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
in the past without the consent of affected customers.

addresses and phone number; people (with addresses and phone numbers)
listed in 1-Click settings; e-mail addresses of other people; content of

Web
site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed
or
searched for; your Purchase history; and the phone number you used
to
call our phone number. We may also use browser data such as cookies,
Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar
data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other
purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as
JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page
response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page
interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs),
and methods used to browse away from the page.

third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next
