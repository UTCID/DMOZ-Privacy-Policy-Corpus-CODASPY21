Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
Privacy policy
The Educational Theatre Association cares about your privacy. We want to tell you in detail about the Internet policies and practices which we have adopted to protect your privacy so that you can feel confident about how we handle the personal information you entrust to us online.
It’s a good idea to check our privacy policy from time to time when you visit our site. Any change in our privacy policy will be prospective only. We will not make any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.
When do we collect personal information?
We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. Visitors may choose to submit personal information, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for our discussion forums, or to place an order. If you are under the age of thirteen we are not allowed, by the current laws governing personally identifiable information on the Internet, to solicit or retain any information from you.
What do we do with the information?
Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor or member. We will collect personally identifiable information to email you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features, and to send out brochures and other information on our services and events. We offer visitors and members an “opt-out” option at any time they wish to cease receiving emails or other information from us. Visitors and members may “opt-out” by replying to an email with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the topic, or you may contact us by email.
We do not release email addresses to third-party vendors, but may deliver carefully screened offers and information on behalf of selected organizations. Information is primarily used by us, our agents, or business partners to respond to your requests and to better serve you.
How do we use cookies?
We use cookie technology and IP addresses only to obtain non-personal information from online visitors to provide them with the best possible personalized online experience. To do this we do keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac) used by the visitor, and the domain name of the visitor’s Internet service provider. We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. This helps us keep our site fresh and interesting to the majority of our visitors. Cookie technology also helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor’s interests. You may disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do disable cookies, we may be unable to optimize your visit to our site.
Is credit card transaction information secure?
We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to communicate with your browser software when you order from us online. SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card transaction and order information that you send us. Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure.
What do you do to safeguard personal information?
We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards. We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who work with us agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors.
