PurseBlog Terms of Service
January 1, 2019
These Terms of Service are applicable to our PurseBlog website located at www.purseblog.com, which includes our PurseForum site located at forum.purseblog.com,  our PurseForum mobile applications, and the services provided through our website and mobile applications (which are referred to collectively in these Terms of Service as “PurseBlog”). PurseBlog is provided to you by Midley, Inc. (“Midley,” “we,” “us” and “our”). These Terms of Service contain the terms and conditions that govern your use of PurseBlog, and your use of PurseBlog constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to these Terms of Service.
In order to participate in the interactive portions of PurseBlog, including PurseForum, you must first register with us through our on-line registration process, as described in Section 4 below. As part of the registration process you will be required to affirmatively accept these Terms of Service, as well as the PurseForum Rules, which are located at https://forum.purseblog.com/help/terms, and the PurseBlog Privacy Policy, which is located at https://www.purseblog.com/privacy/.
Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms of Service contain provisions that govern how claims you and we may have against each other are resolved (see section 13 below), including an agreement and obligation to arbitrate disputes, which will, subject to limited exceptions, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding arbitration, unless you opt-out in accordance with section 13(E).  Unless you opt-out of arbitration: (a) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against us on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action or proceeding and (b) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.

If you are a registered user of PurseBlog, we will notify you of material changes to these Terms of Service by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. It is therefore very important that you make sure we have a current email address for you on file so that you will receive notice of any material changes.

We consider the protection of copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights of utmost importance.  We follow the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and, in addition to following the notice and take down provisions of the DMCA, we may also take similar action in response to notices based on other rights.

Legal Disputes and Arbitration Agreement
Please Read This Following Clause Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court
Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at https://www.purseblog.com/contact/ to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of PurseBlog. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. Each of you and Midley agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to section 12(A) above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.  All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of PurseBlog shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.  The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.  The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Service shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
The AAA’s rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.  A request for payment of fees should be submitted to AAA along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to AAA.  If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain circumstances.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and Midley each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and Midley each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 12(B) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
Exception – Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
30 Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 12(B), 12(C), and 12(D) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: 757 SE 17th St, #1177, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use PurseBlog, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
Exclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 12(B) do not apply, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Miami, Florida (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Miami, Florida, for any litigation other than small claims court actions.
Applicable Law. You agree that federal laws and the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Service and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Midley.
