particular circumstances. If we are unable to collect the personal information
we need, we may be unable to meet the expectations of our customers
or provide the products and services they wish to receive.
WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES EFTEL COLLECT?
Eftel collects or holds personal information about individuals who are:
Prospective customers. This includes people we think may be interested

interest in obtaining or learning more about those products
and services.
Current customers. This includes people who purchase Eftel products
or services or who hold an account with Eftel.

or services but do not currently hold any active Eftel account.

to deal with Eftel anonymously or using a pseudonym. For example, if
you make a general inquiry to one of our call centres, or want to make a
complaint or log a service fault unless the inquiry or complaint relates to
a particular account.
However, if you do not wish to be identified we may not be able to provide
the information or assistance you require.

law. For example, we are required under the Telecommunications Act
1997 to obtain specified proof of identity information before providing
certain mobile telephone services.
Financial and credit information, including credit history, employment
history, remuneration details, bank account and credit card
information, information about assets and income and details of relevant

personal information about you, including your name, address, telephone
service number and other public number customer details, and
to provide it to the operator of the IPND) for inclusion in the IPND.
Information in the IPND is used to develop directories and to assist
emergency service organisations. If your phone number is unlisted,

and disclosure will be strictly controlled.

payment patterns and history; and
inquiries and complaints.
We collect information about our employees and prospective employees
for the purpose of making employment decisions and managing our staff.
We also collect information about suppliers, service providers, agents
and affiliates, and their staff, for the purposes of conducting our day-today
business activities.
HOW DOES EFTEL COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We collect personal information by various means and via various media,
depending on the particular business context.
We collect information about prospective customers both directly and
via our agents, service providers and affiliates. We may collect this information:
when you make an inquiry at a Eftel kiosk, Eftel dealer or Eftel event;
through our door to door sales activities;
through our call centres;
through Eftel websites, or websites operated by Eftel's affiliates;
through social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook; and
through the purchase of marketing lists, databases and data aggregation
services.
When you become or apply to become a Eftel customer, in addition to
collecting personal information directly from you, we may also collect
information about you from our agents and affiliates, credit reporting
agencies, your past and present employers, current service providers,
family members or associates and other third parties.
When you apply to become a Eftel customer, we will ask you to consent
to us collecting information from particular third parties. We will only
collect personal information from those parties if you consent. If you do
not consent, we may not be able to provide the service or product you
require. We are authorised to collect some personal information from
third parties under Privacy Law.
Eftel receives unsolicited personal information from time to time. In
accordance with its obligations under Privacy Law, Eftel will decide
whether it would have been permitted to solicit and collect that information
and if it would not have been, will destroy or de-identify the information
(provided it is lawful to do so).
WHAT INFORMATION WILL EFTEL GIVE YOU WHEN IT
COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Eftel is required by Privacy Law to take reasonable steps to ensure that
you are made aware of certain information when it collects personal information
about you. For example, we are required to:
tell you which Eftel entity you are dealing with and how to contact it;
make sure you are aware that we have collected the information (if we
collect it from a third party without your knowledge);
identify any law that authorises or requires collection of the information;
let you know the purposes for which we collect the information, the
entities that the information is likely to be disclosed to and whether
the information will be transferred outside Australia; and
tell you how to access our Privacy Policy and complaint handling procedures.
This Privacy Policy sets out this information in general terms. However,
where we collect personal information in relation to a particular product
or service, and the information we are required to provide is not likely
to be obvious from the circumstances, we usually provide the required
information in a 'collection statement'. The way we do this will depend on
how you are dealing with us. For example:
When personal information is collected via the Eftel website or any
affiliate website that Eftel may advertise on, a statement is displayed
or a link provided to a statement that sets out the information we are
required to provide.
A statement containing the required information is printed on the
sign-up page of most of the standard forms we use to collect personal
information.
When you deal with us on the telephone, this information is given to
you by the operator or via a recorded message.
If we collect personal information about you from a third party, we take
reasonable steps to ensure you receive the information we are required
to provide. However, we may do this by requiring the third party to
provide the information, rather than us providing the information to you
directly.
We may also include information about our collection of personal information
in welcome packs, customer account statements, update bulletins,
notices and other documents we give to our customers.

HOW DOES EFTEL PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION?
Eftel recognises the importance of protecting your personal information
and of ensuring that it is complete, accurate, up-to-date and relevant.
When you call Eftel, we complete an ID check to verify your identity and
to check the details we hold about you are correct and to update them if
required. For some safety critical information, for example medical information
required to ensure priority assistance, we initiate checks on
an annual basis.
We have documented processes for verifying personal information collected
for particular transactions, such as proof of occupancy, change of
occupier and priority assistance. Our staff are trained to properly handle
the different types of information they receive, particularly sensitive information.
We have quality assurance measures in place to monitor calls
to ensure that our processes are being followed.
While some of the personal information we collect is held in hardcopy
form, most personal information is stored in electronic databases.
We have extensive processes in place to ensure that our information
systems and files are kept secure from unauthorised access and interference.
These include:
System access is controlled by logins and different security levels.
Access to customer information for all staff (including agents in our
Manila call centre) is centrally controlled. Access requests must be
supported by a request from senior management.
Access authorisation is layered and access authorisations are specific
to the job function of each staff member. For example, staff with
responsibility for fault management have no access to credit card information.
Staff are only trained in areas of the system specific to the
function of their job.
Functional restrictions apply. Remote access is only available to selected
senior staff members. Measures are taken to prevent printing,
copying or recording of customer information that can be accessed
electronically. For example, call centre team members work in a paperless
environment, cannot print information and are not permitted
to have mobile phones or cameras on the call centre floor.
Account and system access and modification is logged to enable
access or modification of any customer record by any staff member
to be identified. Audits of access logs are conducted periodically.
Our employees undergo privacy and information security training on
induction and are required to sign acknowledgements of their obligations
in relation information security and appropriate use of our IT
systems.
We have contractual arrangements in place with our agents, service
providers and affiliates that require them to have comply with applicable
privacy laws and Eftel privacy policies. Our contractual arrangements
with third parties who are outside Australia are designed
to ensure that personal information transferred to those parties is afforded
the same level of protection as would apply to the information
in Australia.
CAN YOU ACCESS OR CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
EFTEL HOLDS ABOUT YOU?
You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. If
your request is particularly complex or requires detailed searching of
our records, there may be a cost to you in order for us to provide you
with this information.
If you believe there are errors in the information we hold about you, you
have a right to ask us to correct the information.
However, we are not required to provide access where we believe doing
so would:
prejudice law enforcement or crime prevention activities;
pose a serious threat to health or safety;
have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
prejudice Eftel in legal proceedings or negotiations with you;
reveal information connected with a commercially sensitive decision
making process; or
be contrary to law.
If you wish to have access to information Eftel holds about you, you
should contact Eftel Customer Service.
