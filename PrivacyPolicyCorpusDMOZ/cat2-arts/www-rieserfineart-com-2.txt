Privacy Statement
Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from you when you visit or order products from our site, and explains what we do with that information. Our Privacy Policy is effective as of April 2020 and will remain in effect until we replace it.
Information Collection & Use
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (including, but not limited to, name, telephone number, email, and shipping address) and financial information (including, but not limited to, credit card number, expiration date, etc.).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. In order to fulfill your orders we may share personally identifiable information with certain third party providers.
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.
Log Files
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
We may use a third-party tracking service that uses JavaScript to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. The information we track is limited to usage and volume statistics and is used to provide insight into the effectiveness of our online marketing initiatives and strategies.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in cookies to your personal information in order to provide a faster and more pleasant online shopping experience.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
We set a session cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once per session.  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third-party sites that may be linked to from this site.

Profile
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third-party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchase history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
Supplementation of Information
In order to provide secure and convenient online ordering, we use a third-party vendor, to verify your credit card information and billing address.
Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)
We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our agents, including agencies or third-party vendors used to aggregate demographic information, provide marketing analysis and consult on advertising strategies. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.
Personally Identifiable Information

This Web site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by James J. Rieser Fine Art.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
Be careful of disclosing any of your personally identifiable information when leaving our site. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you do not agree to any new terms, your sole remedy is to stop using the Site. If any of these Site Terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition.
Business Transitions
In the event James J. Rieser Fine Art goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. You consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information to any such successor entity unless you notify us via email to the contrary.
