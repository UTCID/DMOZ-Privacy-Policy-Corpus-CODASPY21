These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of law. In addition, the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, including any amendments thereto, is expressly excluded hereby. Except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, including the scope, the construction or application of this Agreement, shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association then in force. The arbitration hearings and all meetings pursuant to this section shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and shall be conducted in English. If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after demand by either of them, each party shall select one arbitrator knowledgeable about Internet commerce in Massachusetts and the USA generally, and notify the other of its selection, and such two arbitrators shall select a third from a list of arbitrators (with knowledge of the Internet industry) qualified by the American Arbitration Association in Massachusetts. If this procedure for selecting arbitrators fails, then a neutral arbitrator based in Massachusetts with knowledge of Internet commerce in Massachusetts and the USA generally shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall conduct a hearing within thirty (30) days after their selection. A majority of the arbitrators (if there is more than one pursuant to this clause) shall determine the decision/award, which shall be rendered within five (5) days after the completion of the hearing. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties both as to law and to fact, and shall not be appealable to any court in any jurisdiction. The parties shall share the expenses of the arbitrators equally. Nothing in any indemnification provision hereunder shall be construed as having any bearing on the award of attorneys’ fees or arbitrators’ fees under this section.

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single web site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that web site;
3. Identification of the material (i.e., the Third Party Content) that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit WIF to locate the material;

5. A statement, as follows: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”; and
6. A statement, as follows: “The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”
Upon receipt of the written notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 6 above:
1. WIFV/NE shall remove or disable access to the Third Party Content that is alleged to be infringing;
2. WIFV/NE shall forward the written notification to the alleged infringer (the “Subscriber”);
3. WIFV/NE shall take reasonable steps to promptly notify the Subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the Third Party Content.

To be effective, a Counter Notification must be a written communication provided to WIFV/NE’s Designated Agent that includes substantially the following:
1. A physical or electronic signature of the Subscriber;
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

Upon receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 4 above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled and WIFV/NE will comply with this requirement within a reasonable time (or as otherwise required by law), provided WIFV/NE’s Designated Agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain Subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on WIFV/NE’s network or system.
GENERAL
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. You agree that these Terms of Use and all agreements and notices incorporated herein may be automatically assigned by WIFV/NE, in our sole discretion, to a third party. You may not assign your obligations to any other entity.
