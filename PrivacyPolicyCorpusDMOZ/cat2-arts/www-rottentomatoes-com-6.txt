Christy Lemire
Associated Press
October 25, 2018
The movie is a lot like 1995's Clueless, which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks.

Newsweek
November 1, 2007
Legally Blonde is a broad, glossy teen comedy that shows off Witherspoon's wicked comic talents. Silly? You bet. But if this Popsicle of a movie melts long before it's over, the first half has more good laughs than all of "Sweethearts."

Funny, enjoyable and, above all, relaxing. You won't need much brain power, but you'll certainly have fun.

Ms. Witherspoon won me over right from the start.

It's a formula that's well done here with plenty of laughs.

Rick Groen
Globe and Mail
July 16, 2001
They've devised a potentially rich premise, only to play it safe, smoothing off every sharp edge and dumbing down any acerbic point.

Entertainment Weekly
July 16, 2001
As an actor of distinction who's all of 25, Reese Witherspoon reveals interesting dark roots even as she plays golden girls.

Starts heading nowhere after the first half-hour, and careers and flounders badly until it gets there.

Michael O'Sullivan
Washington Post

Really nothing more than Clueless redux but without the edgy, knowing wit.
Original Score: 2/5

Stephen Hunter
Washington Post
July 13, 2001
Blondes may or may not have more fun, but in this one case, they certainly provide more fun.
Original Score: 4/5

Blonde joke's punchline all about getting a guy.

This might not work with anyone but Reese Witherspoon.

Seattle Times

As sweet, fluffy and pink as cotton candy -- too much can make you sick, but at 90 minutes, it goes down pretty easy.

Witherspoon is so innately likable that the film goes along pleasantly enough.

A perfectly enjoyable film, as long as you let go of a few glaringly obvious contradictions.

A.O. Scott
New York Times
July 13, 2001
Doesn't offer enough occasions for real spontaneous laughter to justify the cost of a full-price ticket.
Original Score: 2.5/5
Top Critic
Jonathan Foreman
New York Post
July 13, 2001
A watery, poorly directed update of Clueless.
Original Score: 2/4
Top Critic
Kenneth Turan
Los Angeles Times
July 13, 2001
This film can't figure out where to go with its concept and increasingly unravels as it marches along.

Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit.

If we begin by laughing at Elle, we end up rooting for her, even when the script seems to have stopped doing anything much for her.
