What personal information will we collect from you?
We will only collect enough personal data from you to provide you with the service you have requested.
If you sign up to our mailing service, we will ask for your email address as a requisite. The form will also collect your IP address, and timestamp associated with anyone who submits the form. You can provide your name, county, job title, and institution, for monitoring and reporting purposes (the information will be anonymised) and for tailored emails, but this is optional.
We will also hold information you have supplied for other purposes – for example in connection with enquiries made via our contact form. By submitting information to us you are consenting to the management and use of your information as set out in this Privacy Statement.
For An Taisce Membership we may collect: Name, Organisation and Position, Address, Email, Phone, Default Payment Method, Membership Type, Date of Joining. For Family Memberships we may collect the same data for an additional family member. If you pay by Direct Debit we will collect and securely store bank account number and signature. If you donate over €250 in a year we may write to you to give you an opportunity to fill in a CHY form for An Taisce to claim back income tax paid on your donations. If you complete this form we will securely store your PPS number. If you pay by credit card online your transaction is processed by Paypal and we do not collect your credit card details. If you pay by credit or debit card by post or by phone then we collect your credit or debit card details. We process these promptly using Realex and then immediately securely erase the credit card details.
What do we do with your personal information?
We will use your information to administer your membership. This includes submitting your membership to An Taisce's Council for approval, processing your payment, sending your Membership card, making your name and membership status available to An Taisce's Local Associations, sending you An Taisce's Annual Report and agendas for General Meetings of the company.
If you supply your information for other purposes, for example if you send us an enquiry, we will only use your information for the purpose of answering your query.
If we want to use your data for any purpose outside of the terms of this Privacy Statement, we will ask you first.
