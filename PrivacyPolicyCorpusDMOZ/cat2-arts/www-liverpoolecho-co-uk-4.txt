Terence Dunn suffered severe injuries when he was subjected to a street attack by a man thought to have been wielding a golf club. He died on September 24, 2019, just over three months after the assault. Four people have been questioned in connection with his murder, but no-one has been charged.
Terence, known as Terry, was attacked on Wapshare Road in Norris Green at around 3.40pm on June 18.
The suspect was challenged by a passer-by but then ran down a cut-through onto Kilrea Close.
Detectives believe he may have then fled down the Loop Line. He was described as white, 5ft 7in, of slim build, with blonde hair, and was said to have been wearing dark clothing with a hood up.
Terry, 49, spent 10 weeks in Aintree hospital receiving treatment for his injuries.
The keen fisherman was released but then found dead when emergency services were called to the Clubmoor home of a friend of his on September 24.
He was described as " a nice fella " whose "heart was in the right place" in tributes following his death.

A 26-year-old man from Walton, a 27-year-old man from Old Swan and a 46-year-old man, also from Walton, have since been questioned on suspicion of his murder. A 54-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. They have all since been released on conditional bail. An investigation into Mr Dunn’s death remains ongoing, Merseyside Police today said.
Issuing an appeal on the anniversary of his death, Detective Inspector Tracey Martin today said: “Terry’s family have now endured a year without him and while I know the pain of losing him will be with them every day, I am sure today will be particularly difficult.
“Terry was well-known and liked in Norris Green, but for some reason it seems he was specifically targeted.
“We suspect the offender may have had a grudge against him and was trying to send a strong message. "If you have heard anything locally about this, we would be keen to hear from you – any information, however small it may seem, could prove crucial for our enquiries.

"We are also continuing our search for another man, believed to be in his 70s, who we think may live locally and would have passed the man carrying a golf club (as seen on CCTV) on the day of the assault.
“Could this have been you? It is crucial if you know who this witness is, or if this was you, that you speak to us. Even if you do not remember the incident, but you are the person pictured, please come forward so we can continue piecing together this investigation.
“We are determined to find the person responsible for Mr Dunn’s death and put them before the courts. His family deserve to know who is responsible for his death and we are committed to seeking justice for them.” *Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police via Twitter (@MerPolCC) or Facebook (Merseyside Police CC).
