Privacy Policy
This statement comprises the privacy policy of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (the “Foundation”) as it pertains to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (www.gf.org) website (the “Website”). We welcome you to use the Website, which can be accessed and browsed without the need to submit any personally-identifiable information (“Personal Information”). We strive to make sure that any Personal Information that you do provide to us is protected and secure. Our privacy policy tells you how we treat the information about you that we receive through this Website.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
The Foundation collects Personal Information on the Website as follows:
Donations: Any Personal Information you submit through the “Donations” section of the Website (including your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and relationship to the Foundation) to make an online donation is used strictly to process your donation and to provide you with a receipt of the transaction and an acknowledgement letter for your records, unless you request that the donation be made anonymously.
WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED
The Foundation will not share your Personal Information with any other company or third party without your permission, except as set forth above. We may, however, provide Personal Information to third parties in response to a subpoena or when we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or other legal obligation; in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; to protect the security or confidentiality of our records; or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights.
TRACKING AND COOKIES
The Foundation collects non-personal information (IP addresses, for example) from visitors to help us understand how our site is being used. Like most websites, the Website may place a “cookie,” or small file, in the browser of a visitor’s computer. This cookie will assign a user a unique number that allows the Foundation to save information so that the information does not need to be re-entered. We may use cookies to provide you with a more customized browsing experience while you are on the Website. If you refuse to allow us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be restricted from some pages and services on the Website. Our site may contain links to other sites that may use cookie technology. We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies.
We may also track IP addresses, navigation patterns and requests made to our server when we monitor Website traffic. We use this information to improve the structure, content and general usability of the Website.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
The Foundation uses reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information and to store it securely. Personal Information that is transmitted to us online is encrypted during transmission and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to your Personal Information is reasonably restricted to prevent unauthorized access. Only employees of the Foundation are granted access to Personal Information. Access is password protected, and employees are advised that the information to which they have access is confidential and must be protected. Finally, the servers on which we store Personal Information are kept in a reasonably secure environment.
We retain Personal Information collected from the Website for only as long as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected. Once such information is no longer required, we take steps to ensure that the information is destroyed in a reasonably secure manner.
CORRECTING / UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION
You may access and correct any editable aspect of your subscriptions with the Foundation, or correspond with us about your subscriptions or our policies, by contacting us at:
John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
90 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10016
CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY
Our privacy policy may change in the future. We encourage you to review this page periodically to understand our policy regarding our collection and use of Personal Information. The Effective Date of this policy, as stated below, indicates the last time this policy was revised or materially changed. Checking the Effective Date below allows you to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the policy.
Effective May 8, 2020.
