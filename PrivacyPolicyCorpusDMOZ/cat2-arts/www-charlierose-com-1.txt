2. How We Collect and Use Your Information

"Personally identifiable information" is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, other contact information or credit card information (or other information that is associated or aggregated by us with such above information), and non-personally identifiable information is information that does not personally identify you, including anonymous information. We also collect information regarding your use of this website.
We use this information to understand better how our viewers use our website, research our viewers' demographics, interests, and behavior, provide visitors with customized services, content, information and advertising, and for other similar purposes. We may also use cookies and other technologies to learn about and remember our visitors' technology and other preferences and equipment (such as broadband or low bandwidth access), gain insight into and customize our visitors' use of our website, and help maintain our website's proper operation.
We employ services that use cookies, tracking code and other technologies, including Google Analytics, to analyze how visitors use our website. The information collected (including but not limited to your browser and operating system, IP address and location, pages visited on our website and time spent here) is transmitted to and stored by others, including Google. We use this information to evaluate visitors' use of this website in an aggregate manner, reports on website activity and other related services.

Website Visits
In general, we automatically gather certain information from our website visitors, such as the number and frequency of your visits. This information may include the URLs of the websites you visit, your browser and operating system, your IP address, how long you spend on our website, what pages and content you view here and other information. We also collect information through the methods listed below.
We and our authorized designees collect information through the servers for this website, cookies and other technologies. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive; each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser preferences allow it. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although that may prevent you from using certain features and functionalities on our website, and you may be required to re-enter your password or other information more frequently during a session or after you revisit our website. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. We use a "persistent" cookie to save information about your operating system and technology preferences and track website usage; in addition, if you sign up for a user account, we will save your account user id and/or e-mail address. We also use a "session cookie" to help us "remember" you until the session times out, or the closing of your browser which helps ensure that you remain logged into your account. Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of a session.
Usually, the information collected through cookies and other technologies is not personally identifiable in and of itself. However, these technological methods may enable us to collect and use information in a personally identifiable form, and we may combine or aggregate data collected through cookies and other technologies with personally identifiable information; in that case, we will treat the resulting information as personal information.
We are not responsible for any other websites accessible from or linked to this website, including their privacy policies or information collection practices. Further, we do not control any cookies, web beacons or other similar devices placed on our website by third parties, such as those that may be embedded in third-party advertising.
We may use third-party advertising networks to deliver some of the advertisements that are placed on our website. These advertising networks may use cookies, web beacons, or other technological methods to collect information about your visits to our website in order to provide you with relevant advertisements.

We may share your non-personally identifiable information with others, such as donors, sponsors, advertisers and others for informational or promotional purposes. We may share personally identifiable information with service providers, to the extent necessary for them to perform their functions for us.
If Charlie Rose Inc. merges with or is acquired by another business entity, Charlie Rose Inc. has the right to share your personally identifiable information with that entity.

4. How We Protect Your Information
The security of your information is important to us. We employ several different technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or use.
You should be aware, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and there is always the risk that unauthorized persons may access or use your personally identifiable information. You use our website and send us such information at your own risk.
5. Your Choices About Your Information
Do Not Track
We do not currently track our customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser allows you to set the DNT signal so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our website visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please e-mail us at
