How is information collected?
We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

Newsletters and Website Emails
Starlight Theatre may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors.

Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes, except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

Cookies
As with many Websites, the Website uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Website whenever you visit the Website, and make using the Website easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, some areas of the Website may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.
IP Addresses and Click-stream Data
We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Website, our computers log your IP address.
Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
Transaction Information
If you order any information from our Website, buy any of our products or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection.
How we use the information we collect
We internally use personally identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site’s content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and provide better service to our customers.
We may occasionally use a customer’s email address and, in rare situations mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices.
We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.
With whom the information may be shared
Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the terms of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from Starlight Theatre, and our promotional partners based on the information you have provided us. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and other opportunities/offers. These third parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements.
We may be required to collect, share or disclose your personal identifiable information without your consent in the following instances: i) pursuant to judicial orders, subpoenas, decrees, or warrants; ii) in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud, safety or the security of persons or property, violations of the Starlight Theatre Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use, or as otherwise authorized or required by law; and iii) in connection with the sale or transfer of any ownership interest in Starlight Theatre.
While we believe this disclosure of your information will result in opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your information to any third party (except as noted above).

It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. You can request at any time that Starlight Theatre not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology -- though some of our features won’t work if you decide to do this.
What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?
We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web.
Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards
The Website may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so.

Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

This includes links from social networks, sponsors and partners that may use the Website’s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.
