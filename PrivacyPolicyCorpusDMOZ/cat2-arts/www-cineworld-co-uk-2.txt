Directly from you, either in person (at our cinemas or otherwise), via our Sites, on our social media pages or when you contact us or someone contacts us on your behalf;
Automated technologies, such as CCTV or other recording systems, cookies, server logs and other similar technologies;

Please see section 7 ‘Who do we share your personal information with?' to find out more about these group companies and third party service providers;
Providers of social media platforms (such as FaceBook, Twitter and Instagram) where you share our content through social media, by liking us on Facebook, following or tweeting about us on Twitter; and
Otherwise as explained below in this What Personal Information do we collect and how do we use it? section.
Our primary goal in collecting personal information about you is to: (i) verify your identity and age; (ii) provide our Services to you and carry out requests made by you on the Sites or in our cinemas; (iii) help us improve our products and services and develop and market new products and services; (iv) investigate or settle inquiries or disputes; (v) comply with any applicable law, court order, other judicial process, or the requirements of a regulator; (vi) enforce our agreements with you; (vii) protect the rights, property or safety of us or third parties, including our other customers and users of the Sites and at our cinemas; (viii) provide support for the provision of our Services; and (ix) use as otherwise required or permitted by law.

5. Fulfilment of products and services (Section 4.1)
We collect and maintain personal information that is voluntarily submitted to us during the use of the Sites and/or our Services. We use the contact and payment details which are provided to us so that we can fulfil the supply of products and services which have been ordered from our Sites or in our cinemas. We will use contact information to send you service related communications relating to these orders. This includes your purchase of products and services, your registration for an account with us, your attendance at events hosted by us or our third party partners, your hire of our cinemas for your own events and the processing of returns and refunds. For example:
Ticket bookings, gifts and other online purchases.
If you wish to book tickets through our Sites we will need to know your name, and your email address. We may also need this information when you make any other purchases via our Sites, such as ordering food, drink, or 3D glasses. If you request a booking confirmation to be sent by SMS, we will also ask you to provide your mobile phone number.
If you wish to purchase a gift from the Gifts section of our Sites we will need to know your name, and email address. We will also need to know the name of the recipient and the delivery address for gifts sent by post or the name and email address of the recipient where gifts are sent by email.
We use this Information to process and fulfil your orders and to send you service related emails (and where requested, text messages) for your booking or purchase. We may also use these details to send you a follow-up service email after your cinema visit, to check that you were satisfied with our service.
If you choose to pay for your purchases on our websites by credit, debit or charge card those payments will be processed by our payment provider rather than by us. If you use a Cineworld gift card, e-gift code or other promotional code to pay for your purchases those payments may be processed by our gifts and promotions service providers rather than by us.
We may also receive part of the payment details such as your name, email address and some of the digits of your payment card number from our payment processor. These will be used to help connect your payment with your booking on our Site and may also be used by us if we provide you with a refund.
What is our legal basis?
It is necessary for us to use your personal information to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you such as your contract with us for your ticket or gift purchase. It is in our legitimate interest to use personal data of a gift recipient in order to provide them with the gifts purchased for them.

6. Verify the age of persons using our products and services (Section 4.2)
We welcome children and young people to our cinemas. However, some of our Services and features available on our Sites (including online ticket booking, Unlimited memberships and My Cineworld accounts) have age restrictions attached to their use. These age restrictions are explained in the terms and conditions relating to our Services, which are located here.
This means that we may need to ask you to provide your date of birth and, where our products or services are being purchased as a gift, the date of birth of the recipient of the gift.
We may also use your date of birth to understand more about our customers (see the Customer Insight and Analysis section for more details about our use of your personal information for this purpose).
What is our legal basis?
Where we use your personal information to verify you or the person receiving our Services meets any age restrictions which we have set, it is in our legitimate interests to do so. Where we use your date of birth to prevent you from accessing age restricted films, we do so because this is necessary for us to comply with legal obligations to which we are subject. When you use our Services, it is also necessary for us to process your personal information for the purpose of performing our contract with you.

Please see the ‘Providing and administering My Cineworld accounts’ section for further details.

You can find out more about what’s included with the Unlimited membership service here. In addition, where we have a lawful right to send you marketing communications, we will also send you marketing relating to your Unlimited membership. Please see the Marketing communications section for further information.

Where you have purchased an Unlimited membership for yourself or as a gift for someone else, it is necessary for us to use your personal information to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you such as your contract with us for your purchase or use of Unlimited membership.

8.2 To external third parties
Some of the third parties that we describe in section 7 may be located outside of the EEA or may otherwise transfer your personal data outside of the EEA.
Where we transfer your personal data to external third parties, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.
In respect of transfers of your personal information outside of the EEA, this means that we will ensure that there is a lawful basis for transferring personal information outside the EEA. Our standard practice is to use ‘model clauses’ which have been approved by the European Commission for such transfers. We may also rely on other mechanisms where appropriate, including reliance on a third party’s ‘binding corporate rules’ or ‘EU-US Privacy Shield’ certification.

Our Sites contain links to third party websites and services, including those of our third party partners. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website or you request a service from a third party, this Privacy Policy no longer applies.
Your browsing and interaction on any other websites, or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website’s or third party service provider’s own rules and policies.
We do not monitor, control, or endorse the privacy practices of any third parties.
We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.

22. How long do we keep your personal information for? (Section 10)
Whenever we collect or process your personal data we will usually keep it for one year after our last interaction with you or otherwise in accordance with our data retention policy, pursuant to which we do not retain personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is collected. We will keep personal data you give us in relation to any contract that we have with you for seven years. If your information is only useful for a short period e.g. for specific marketing campaigns we may delete it.
If your information is only useful for a short period e.g. for specific marketing campaigns or for coronavirus (Covid-19) contact tracing, we may delete it after a shorter period (e.g. 21 days for contact tracing). At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning. We keep the length of time that we hold your personal data for under review.

23. Confidentiality and security of your personal information (Section 11)

unauthorised access;
improper use or disclosure;
unauthorised modification; and
unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
All of our employees and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal information on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personal information of all users of our Services.

You have the following rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details set out in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy or using any other method described below:
Your right of access.
If you ask us, we’ll confirm whether we’re processing your personal information and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personal information (along with certain other details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
Your right to rectification.
If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you’re entitled to have it rectified. If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
If you have a My Cineworld account, you can log in and amend your contact details and email and text marketing preferences whenever you like.
Your right to erasure.
You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances such as where we no longer need it or if you withdraw your consent (where applicable). If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
Your right to restrict processing.
You can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal information or you object to us processing it. It won’t stop us from storing your personal information though. We’ll tell you before we lift any restriction. If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the restriction where it is possible for us to do so. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.
Your right to data portability.
With effect from 25 May 2018, you have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal information you’ve provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer this to a third party of your choice.
Your right to object.
You can ask us to stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:
- relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your personal information, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or
- processing your personal information for direct marketing.
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing communications sent to you by email or text at any time by using the ‘opt-out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ link that we will present to you in the marketing communication. Please note that it may take us a few days (but usually no longer than 14 days) to ensure our marketing systems are updated and during this period you may still receive marketing communications from us.
Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.
You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it’s based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you, unless such profiling is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us.
Your right to withdraw consent.
If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
If you have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we’ve handled your personal information, you can report it to relevant Supervisory Authority which, in relation to provision of our Sites and Services in:
