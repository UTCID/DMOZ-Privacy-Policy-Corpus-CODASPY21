Security and Privacy Policies
Information That May Be Collected And How It May Be Used
If you do nothing during your visit to the County website but browse
or download information, we may automatically collect and store the
following information about your visit:
The Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name used, but not the
email address. The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned
either to your Internet Service Provider or directly to your computer.
We use the IP address to direct Internet traffic to you;  The
type of browser and operating system you used and your connection
speed;  The date and time you visited this site;  The
webpages or services you accessed at this site; and  The website
you visited prior to coming to this website.  The information we
collect or store may be used to improve the content of our Web
services and to help us understand how people are using our services.
Our website logs do not identify anyone personally, and we make no
attempt to link them with the individuals that browse the County
website. If during your visit to the County website or mobile app you
send an email, participate in a survey or report an issue, the
following additional information will be collected:
Email correspondence: The email address and contents of the
email;  Surveys: Any information you volunteered in response to
a survey.  Web or mobile app: Any information submitted as well
as geolocation data permitted by the device and/or technical
specifications such as, but not limited to, camera type, photo
metadata, or device model and operating system.
The information collected may not be limited to text characters and
may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.
The information is retained in accordance with the County's policies.
We may use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond
to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our
website, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate
action. Survey information and issues reported would be used for the
purpose designated.
Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about an individual
that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal
information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's
name, address, and phone number. A domain name or IP address is not
considered personal information.
We will not collect personal information about you unless you
voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e.
sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose not to
participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect
your ability to use any other feature of the County's website.
If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered
by the user, County rules and regulations, the State's Information
Practices Act of 1977 or the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect
it from disclosure.
Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of
personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18)
do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting
personal information to the County as part of a user profile or
personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these
services only if used together with your parents or legal guardians.
If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.
Public Disclosure
We strive to protect personally identifiable information by
collecting only information necessary to deliver our services. All
information that may be collected at this site or through a web or
mobile application becomes public record that may be subject to
inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and any
County ordinance or other law governing the County's disclosure of
records, the County ordinance or other applicable law will control.
Access and Correction of Personal Information
You can review any personal information we collect about you. You
may recommend changes to your personal information you believe is in
error by submitting a written request that credibly shows the error.
If you believe that your personal information is being used for a
purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact
us. In all cases, we will take reasonable steps to verify your
identity before granting access or making corrections. See Contact
Information section.
Cookies
What Is A Cookie?
A cookie is a small data file which may include an anonymous unique
identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and
may either be used only during your session (a "session"
cookie) or may be stored on your computer's hard drive (a
"persistent" cookie). Cookies can contain data about user
movement during the visit to the Web site. If your browser software is
set to allow cookies, a website can send its own cookie to you.
Why Are Cookies Used On Websites?
Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining continuity during a user's
visit to a website. They allow data to be maintained for users'
benefit as they navigate a site. This is referred to as
"session" or "management" cookie. These cookies go
away when you terminate your visit to the website as they are
maintained only in your browser's active memory during your session.
Cookies may also be stored on your computer so that you can be
recognized by a website on subsequent visits. They are read by the
website that sent them whenever you re-visit the website. They are
often used on websites that require you to login so that you can avoid
having to enter all of your login information every visit. They may
store information on your unique identifier and the areas of the
website you have visited before. These cookies are stored on your
computer's hard drive after you have left your website visit and
consequently are often referred to as "persistent" cookies.
Choices About Cookies
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is
different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn
how to change your cookie preferences.)
County Practices Regarding Cookies
Presently, the County uses persistent cookies on some of its web applications.
Security
The County has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its
telecommunications and computing infrastructure. Security measures
have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day
practices of the entire operating environment as part of its
continuing commitment to risk management.
Our cybersecurity program is based on the same security standards
that are required of the Federal and California State Governments as
well as the financial payment industry. Protections include:
Developing Information
Security Policies, Standards Guidelines and Controls.
Implementing countermeasures in aggregated layers that provides
for a holistic cybersecurity defense. Conducting risk and
vulnerability assessments and implementing risk mitigation
measures. Promoting employee information and cybersecurity
awareness training. Providing proactive threat protections,
monitoring for malicious activity, and incident management.
Maintaining compliance with Federal and State statutes and
regulation.
For information about what you can do to protect yourself and your
family from being a victim of cyber-crime, the US-CERT.GOV website has
numerous tips and publications on topics like Keeping Children Safe
Online, Banking Securely Online, Shopping Safely Online, Avoiding
Online Gaming Risks, Using Portable Devices, Secure Social
Networking, Securing Your Computer and Home Networks and many others.
