DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
IXL Learning provides users with access to online services that allow you to create games and quizzes over the Internet and share them with others; give online quizzes and track students' scores; and create your own home pages for posting assignments, class schedules, and links to your favorite websites. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current services, including the release of new IXL Learning services, shall be subject to the Terms of Service (TOS). You understand and agree that all services are provided "AS-IS" and that IXL Learning assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
In order to use the services, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device.

The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and IXL Learning and govern your use of IXL Learning's services, superseding any prior agreements between you and IXL Learning. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software.

You and IXL Learning agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of San Mateo, California. The failure of IXL Learning to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of IXL Learning's services or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no
legal or contractual effect.
