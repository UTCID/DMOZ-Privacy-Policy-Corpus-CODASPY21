If you link to this Site from another web site: (i) the link must not damage, dilute or tarnish the goodwill associated with any Partnership or Site name or entity; (2) the link must not create the false appearance that the other website is sponsored by, endorsed by, affiliated with or associated with the Partnership; (3) the website may not “frame” or alter this Site in any way; and (4) the linked website may not be unlawful, abusive, indecent or obscene, promote violence or illegal acts, be libelous, defamatory or otherwise deemed inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion; and (iv) the linked website may not display our Content, including any of our logos, to create a link, without our prior written consent.
The Site may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by us.

The Partnerhsip makes no warranties or representations about the accuracy or completeness of the Site, and assumes to the maximum extent permitted by law no liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes or inaccuracies on the Site; (b) personal injury or property damage of any nature whatsoever resulting from your access to and use of the Site; (c) unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information and/or financial information stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of transmission to or from our Site; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Site; and/or (f) errors or omissions on our Site or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of any Materials or Content available via the Site.

13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
In no event will the Partnerhsip, its officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever resulting from any (a) mistakes or inaccuracies of Content on the Site, (b) personal injury or property damage of any nature whatsoever resulting from your access to and use of the Site, (c) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers or any and all personal information or financial information stored therein, (d) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Site, (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Site; or (f) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of any Content or Materials posted, emailed, transmitted or made available via the Site, whether based on warranty, contract, tort or any other legal theory and whether or not the Partnership is advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.
You specifically acknowledge that the Partnership shall not be liable for materials or content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party and that the risk of harm or damage from the foregoing rests entirely with you.
This Site is controlled and offered by the Partnership from its facilities in the United States of America. The Partnership makes no representations that the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Site from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
14. INDEMNITY
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees and partners, and any other parties with whom the Partnership may contract to provide the Site, from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, costs, liabilities, judgments, obligations, losses, penalties, fines or forfeitures, expenses or damages (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of whatsoever kind and nature imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Partnership arising out of (i) your use of and access to the Site including your Materials; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation pursuant to these Terms or the Privacy Policy; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Materials caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Use and your use of the Site. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification from you. In such event, you shall provide us with cooperation reasonably requested by us.
15. INDEPENDENT PARTIES
You and the Partnership are independent parties, and nothing in these Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between you and the Partnership. The Partnership is not liable for any representation, act or omission by you contrary to the provisions of these Terms.
16. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
17. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms and all questions relating to the performance, interpretation, breach or enforcement of these Terms, or the rights, obligations and liabilities of you and us under them are governed by the laws of the District of Columbia. You agree that all disputes, claims or litigation arising from or related in any way to these Terms and our relationship with you will be litigated only in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the District of Columbia. You agree to be subject to personal jurisdiction and venue in that location.
18. GENERAL
Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall the Partnership be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.
These Terms together with any other legal notices published by the Partnership on the Site constitute the entire agreement between you and the Partnership with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms by a party will be effective only if in writing and signed by a party. No waiver of any term of this these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the Partnerhsip failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
COPYRIGHT POLICY
Just as the Partnership requires users of the ATI Site (“Site”) to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and business partners, we respect the copyrights of others. To that end, we have adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act “DMCA”) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).
Once the Partnership’s representative who has been designated to receive notification of claimed copyright infringement (“Designated Agent”), whose name and contact information is noted below, receives proper notice of the alleged infringement, or if the Partnership otherwise comes to believe in good faith that any specific content, including user generated content, on the Site contains material that infringes copyright (“Disputed Content”), the Partnership may (1) promptly remove or block access to the Disputed Content or (2) deny access to the Site to users that repeatedly violate copyright or other intellectual property rights. The Partnership will take reasonable steps to notify a user who has uploaded Disputed Content if that Disputed Content is subsequently removed or disabled.
1. PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:
If you believe in good faith that your copyrighted work has been reproduced on the Site without authorization in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may notify our Designated Agent:
Copyright Infringement Officer
AbovetheInfluence Coordinator
352 Park Avenue South, 9th Floor
New York, NY 10010
By phone: 212-922-1560
By email: webmaster@drugfree.org
Pursuant to federal law, your notice must include the following information:
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that you alleged is being infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the Site are included in a single notification, a representative list of all those works on the Site;
Identification of the Disputed Content that you claim is infringing, including information regarding the location of the Disputed Content the copyright owner wishes to be removed from the Site or have access to it blocked with enough detail so that the Partnership may locate the Disputed Content;
Your contact information, including address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Disputed Content is not authorized by the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent or the law; and
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right under the DMCA that is allegedly infringed.
2. SUPPLYING A COUNTER-NOTICE REGARDING ALLEGED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
If you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included in Paragraph 1 above). The counter notification must provide the following information:
Your physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the Disputed Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location where the Disputed Content appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the Disputed Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;
Your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address, and
A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Partnership is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
If our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, the Partnership will send a copy of it to the original complaining party informing that person or entity that the Partnership may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it. Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notice to any party other than the complaining party. Unless the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, the Partnership will replace or restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to re-post the Disputed Content.
