not limited to, supplemental terms and conditions set forth in
paragraph 14 hereof ("Supplemental Terms") governing the use of
certain specific material contained in Ironworks Gaming, sets
forth the terms and conditions that apply to use of Ironworks
Gaming by Subscriber. By using Ironworks Gaming (other than to
read this Agreement for the first time), Subscriber agrees to
comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. The right to
use Ironworks Gaming is personal to Subscriber and is not
transferable to any other person or entity. Subscriber is
responsible for all use of Subscriber's Account (under any screen

conditions, including, but not limited to, adding fees and charges

public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice,
statements, services, offers, or other information or content
expressed or made available by third parties, including
information providers, Subscribers or any other user of Ironworks
Gaming, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s)

third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy,
completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to
Section 6 above for the complete provisions governing limitation
of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.)
In many instances, the content available through Ironworks Gaming
represents the opinions and judgments of the respective
information provider, Subscriber, or other user not under contract
with Ironworks Gaming. Ironworks Gaming neither endorses nor is
responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice
or statement made on Ironworks Gaming by anyone other than
authorized Ironworks Gaming spokespersons while acting in their
official capacities. Under no circumstances will Ironworks Gaming
or The Great Escape Studios be liable for any loss or damage
caused by a Subscriber's reliance on information obtained through
Ironworks Gaming. It is the responsibility of Subscriber to
evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any
information, opinion, advice or other content available through
Ironworks Gaming. Please seek the advice of professionals, as
appropriate, regarding the evaluation of any specific information,
opinion, advice or other content.
12. Miscellaneous.
This Agreement and any operating rules for Ironworks Gaming
established by Ironworks Gaming constitute the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the
parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement shall
be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida,
without regard to its conflict of laws rules. No waiver by either
party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The
section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall
not be given any legal import.
13. Copyrights and Copyright Agent.
Ironworks Gaming respects the rights of all copyright holders and
in this regard, Ironworks Gaming has adopted and implemented a
policy that provides for the termination in appropriate
circumstances of subscribers and account holders who infringe the
rights of copyright holders. If you believe that your work has
been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,

or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information
reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the
complaining party;
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief
that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
