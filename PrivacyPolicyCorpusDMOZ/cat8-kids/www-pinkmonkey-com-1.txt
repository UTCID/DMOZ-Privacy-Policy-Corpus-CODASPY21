Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
PinkMonkey.com
is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which
became effective April 21, 2000.In
compliance with the Childrens Online Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. section 6501 -
6506 and 16 C.F.R.312.1-312.12, this site does not permit children under 13 years
of age to become users. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent
or guardian to access the site.
PinkMonkey.com is also in compliance
with the initiative and spirit of the guidelines set forth by the Children's
Advertising Review Unit (CARU). We have made appropriate changes to our site
to ensure compliance even though this is a voluntary action. We considered it
a primary goal to remain a "G" rated site. We make every attempt to
exclude content that is adult in language or content or contains sexual innuendo.
Other teen and student targeted sites view this type of material as an attraction
and we do not want to be included in that group. If you find objectionable material
on this site or on a site for which we have provided an external link, please
let us know support@pinkmonkey.com.
Access to the Internet:
The PinkMonkey.com website is only
available to persons with access to the Internet. To reach the site, you must
have the proper equipment and connecting devices. The overall Internet contains
websites containing material which is not appropriate for all viewers, particularly
minors. PinkMonkey recommends that each parent take responsibility for the activity
of their children to install effective filtering/blocking mechanisms on each computer
a child may access to protect your children from inappropriate content. If you
install an effective means of filtering/blocking on each computer, you greatly
reduce the ability of your children to access inappropriate content.
