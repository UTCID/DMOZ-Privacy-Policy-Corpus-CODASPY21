Guide to our privacy policy
Guide to our privacy policy
A guide to our privacy policy.
The purpose of this privacy policy is to:
clearly communicate the personal information handling practices of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)
enhance the transparency of AMSA operations
give individuals a better and more complete understanding of the sort of personal information that AMSA holds, and the way we handle that information.
Condensed privacy policy
This privacy policy has been developed to follow the 'layered policy' format, which means that it offers layers of greater or lesser detail so people can read as much as they wish and find what they need fast.
If all you want is a snapshot of our personal information handling practices, you can have a look at our Condensed Privacy Policy. This offers an easy to understand summary of:
how we collect, use, disclose and store your personal information
how you can contact us if you want to access or correct personal information we hold about you.
If, on the other hand, you are in search of a more comprehensive explanation of our information handling practices, then this is the document for you. This document forms the 'detailed' layer of our privacy policy.
Outline of this policy
'Part A—Personal Information Handling Practices' explains our general information handling practices across the agency including information about how we collect, use, disclose and store your personal information.
'Part B—Files' offers further detail by explaining our personal information handling practices in relation to specific AMSA functions or activities. Here you can find out what sort of records we keep and why. You may find this section helpful if, for example, you have made an enquiry to AMSA and wish to know how we manage our files.
'Part C—Online' explains our personal information handling practices when you visit our websites.

Part A—Our personal information handling practices
Our obligations under the Privacy Act
This privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act).  As an Australian Government agency, we are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APP’s) in the Privacy Act which regulate how entities may collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them.
In this privacy policy, 'personal information' has the same meaning as defined by section 6 of the Privacy Act:
'personal information means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
whether the information or opinion is true or not
whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.'
Collection
It is our usual practice to collect personal information directly from the individual or their authorised representative.
Sometimes we collect personal information from a third party or a publicly available source, but only when the individual has consented to such collection, when we are required or authorised by law to collect information from someone other than the individual, or it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual.
In limited circumstances we may receive personal information about third parties from individuals who contact us and supply us with the personal information of others in the documents they provide to us.
We only collect personal information for purposes which are reasonably necessary for or directly related to our functions or activities under the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the Navigation Act 2012, the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, the Shipping Registration Act 1981 or other AMSA legislation. We also collect personal information related to employment services, human resource management, and other corporate service functions (including public awareness and education).
We also collect personal information (including contact details) as part of our normal communication processes directly related to those purposes, including:
when an individual emails staff members
when an individual telephones us
when an individual hands us their business card.
When we solicit personal information, where reasonable we ensure that the person providing the personal information is advised of the matters referred to in Australian Privacy Principle 5 within a Privacy Notice.
Use and disclosure
We only use and disclose personal information for the purposes for which it was given to us, or for purposes which are reasonably necessary for or directly related to one of our functions or activities, and we do not give it to other government agencies, organisations or anyone else unless one of the following applies:
the individual has consented
the individual would reasonably expect AMSA to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose and the secondary purpose is related (or directly related in the case of sensitive information) to the purpose for which it was collected
we are required or authorised by law or by an order of a court/tribunal
we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure of the information is necessary for one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body
it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health, or where it is necessary to assist with the location of a person who has been reported missing
it is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of a legal or equitable claim or in relation to an alternative dispute resolution process.
Data quality
We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate, up to date and complete. These steps include maintaining and updating personal information when we are advised by individuals that their personal information has changed, and at other times as necessary.
Data security
We take steps to protect the personal information we hold against misuse, loss, interference, and unauthorised access, disclosure or modification. These steps include maintaining up-to-date computer and network security systems with appropriate firewalls, access controls and passwords to protect electronic copies of personal information, and securing paper files and physical access restrictions.
When no longer required, personal information is destroyed in a secure manner, or deleted according to the AMSA 's Records Disposal Authority.
Access and correction
An individual has a right to request access to their personal information and to request its correction. If an individual requests access to the personal information we hold about them, or requests that we change that personal information, we will allow access or make the changes unless we consider that there is a sound reason under the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) or other relevant law to withhold the information, or not make the changes.
If we do not agree to provide access to personal information or to amend or annotate the information we hold about them, the individual may seek a review of our decision or may appeal our decision under the FOI Act.
If we do not agree to make requested changes to personal information the individual may make a statement about the requested changes and we will attach this to the record.
Individuals can obtain further information about how to request access or changes to the information we hold about them by contacting us (see details below).
Making a privacy complaint
You are able to make a privacy complaint if you consider that an officer or part of AMSA has breached one of the APP’s or any other obligation under the Privacy Act.
You must generally make a complaint directly to AMSA at first instance.  This complaint should be in writing and should include a description of your privacy problem.  You may direct your complaint to the Privacy Officer at the details provided below.  The Privacy Act states that AMSA will respond within a reasonable time (usually 30 days).
If you are dissatisfied with the response from AMSA, or you do not receive a response within 30 days, you may then complain directly to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (the OAIC).  Complaints to the OAIC must be made in writing.  The OAIC’s preference is for you to use the online Privacy Complaint form if possible.  It is free to lodge a complaint with the OAIC. Your complaint should include:
the name of the agency involved
a brief description of your privacy problem
any action the agency or organisation has taken to fix the problem
copies of any relevant documents, including copies of your complaint to the agency or organisation, and its response.
Go to the OAIC website for information about making a privacy complaint or making a complaint to the OAIC.
Overseas disclosures
AMSA may disclose information to overseas governments or maritime safety agencies for purposes related to legislation governing AMSA's operations, or if required in accordance with Australia’s international obligations.
The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention) establishes a system whereby a country may recognise a seafarer certificate issued by another party to the convention.  If a seafarer wishes to have their Australian certificate recognised for use in another country, AMSA may need to disclose some personal information to the country where the seafarer wishes to work.  It is also a requirement of the STCW Convention that in order for a country to recognise the qualifications of a seafarer from another country, there must be an agreement in place between those two countries.  For a list of countries which can issue a Certificate of Recognition for an AMSA issued certificate, please visit the Certificates of Recognition webpage.
AMSA also provides an automated service to maritime administrations and domestic and international shipping companies to verify the validity of a STCW certificate issued by AMSA. For information on this system, visit Standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Endorsement Guidelines for State issued certificates.  AMSA may also disclose personal information overseas in limited situations related to search and rescue emergencies or in other circumstances related to our statutory functions.
Part B—Files: how we handle specific types of files that contain personal information
The following is an example of the major categories of personal information collected and held by AMSA.

Data quality
We maintain and update personal information in our shipping registration files when we are advised by stakeholders that their personal information has changed.
Data security

Collection
Personal information may be collected directly from the individual concerned.  We may also collect personal information about an individual from third parties where it is relevant, and where the individual has consented to such collection, where we are required or authorised by law to collect the information, or when it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual. In enforcement investigations it may often be unreasonable or impracticable to collect personal information from a person under investigation.
Use and disclosure
Personal information collected for this purpose will only be used in connection with the compliance and enforcement activities of AMSA.  Some of this information is therefore disclosed to law enforcement agencies and the Director of Public Prosecutions and will be used for the purposes of criminal prosecutions or civil proceedings.  AMSA staff in areas of responsibility for maritime safety and for marine environment protection have routine access to this information.

For information about how to access or correct personal information in these files see 'Access and correction' in Part A of this document.
Contacts lists
Purpose
We maintain contacts lists which include contact information about individuals who may have an interest in AMSA’s work and media representatives. We use these contacts lists to distribute information about our activities and publications.
Collection
It is our usual practice to collect personal information in contacts lists directly from individuals, for example, where they have asked to be added to a contact list.
We may also collect personal information about an individual from third parties where it is relevant, but only when the individual has consented to such collection, when we are required or authorised by law to collect information for someone other than the individual, or when it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual.

Users may be required to supply some personal information such as name and email address to use these channels to communicate with the AMSA. Using these services to communicate with us may make some personal information visible to the AMSA and third parties.
Data quality

The personal information in these files relates to the FOI applicant, however, the files may also contain other personal information contained in the documents that are relevant to the FOI request.
Collection
We collect personal information in FOI files directly from individuals who make an FOI request. We may also collect personal information about an individual from third parties where it is relevant, but only when the individual has consented to such collection, when we are required or authorised by law to collect information for someone other than the individual, or when it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual.
Use and disclosure
