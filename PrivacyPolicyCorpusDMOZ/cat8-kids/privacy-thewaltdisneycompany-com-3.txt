We also may allow third-party advertisers to place their performance cookies on your device through their advertisements on this website. The information these third-party performance cookies collect is used to determine which third-party advertisements to display on this website, how often to display them, and in which locations of this websites the third-party advertisements perform best.

Our functionality cookies are used to remember choices you make (such as language preference, country location, or other online settings) and provide the personalised or enhanced features that you select. Our functionality cookies can be used to provide online services to you, or to prevent online services from being offered to you if you previously indicated you did not want to receive such services. Our functionality cookies collect anonymous information; however, if you have a registration account with us, the information collected by us using our functionality cookies may be associated with your registration account, for example, if you are a registered user, our functionality cookies may allow us to track your browsing across different websites operated by the Walt Disney Family of Companies or to detect your experiences when accessing our websites from different devices.

Third-Party Targeted Advertising
Third-party targeted advertising cookies may be placed on your device by third-party advertisers, ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers.
Third-party targeted advertising cookies collect information about your browsing activity across multiple websites and online services in order to provide you with relevant advertisements on our websites and online services and the websites and online services of third parties. Ad networks may share this information with the advertisers using their network. These cookies may also be used to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, for example by collecting data on how many people click on a particular advert. The information collected using these third-party advertising cookies does not identify you personally.
Third-party targeted advertising cookies are often linked to site functionality provided by the third-party which may mean that clicking on the advertisement redirects you to that third-party’s website.
Whilst we cannot always know what third-party advertising cookies are being dropped before they appear on our website, we maintain processes to monitor cookies placed on our websites by external service providers and to control the way in which data is collected via our websites. We can also request that certain third-party advertising cookies are turned off by the third-party provider.
Our Targeted Advertising
Our targeted advertising cookies are placed on your device by us (or service providers operating on our behalf).
We may use these cookies on our websites and in connection with our content and advertisements that appear on third-party websites and online services to recognise that you’ve viewed or interacted with our content or advertisements and so we can show you advertisements for products that we believe will be of interest to you. We may also use these cookies to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement. Our targeted advertising cookies collect anonymous information; however, if you have a registration account with us, the information collected by us using our targeted advertising cookies may be associated with your registration account, for example, we may seek to show more closely targeted adverts to you based on your browsing behaviour.
The organisation setting the cookie (either the third party or us) is responsible for obtaining consent.
