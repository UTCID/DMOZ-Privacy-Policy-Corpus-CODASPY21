African Wildlife Foundation Privacy Policy
Effective: May 25, 2018
African Wildlife Foundation (“AWF”) has the utmost respect for your privacy, and we know that you care how your information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy applies to www.awf.org and all associated subdomains, mobile applications and any online services to which this Privacy Policy links (collectively, the “Sites”). By visiting any of the Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any of the terms herein, please immediately discontinue use of the Sites.
What Information We Collect
When you visit the Sites, AWF and its service providers may collect personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, demographic and payment information. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person.
In addition, AWF and its service providers use a variety of techniques to gather other information about your use of the Sites, including, among other things, your IP address, browser type, mobile device type, content visited while on the Sites and the duration of your visit to the Sites. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.
If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Why We Collect Information
To ensure Africa’s iconic wildlife and wild lands thrive in a modern Africa we need to have effective communication and fundraising activity with our supporters like you. By understanding more about how you engage with the information we provide, we can improve how we communicate the most important messages that you need to hear. Collecting personal information like email addresses or home addresses allows us to directly communicate with you in a timely manner, keeping you the most up-to-date on how you can help Africa’s iconic species. Collecting data also allows us to see which communication works in the most efficient way so we can allocate more funds into conservation.
How We Collect Information
AWF and its service providers collect Personal Information that you provide while using the Sites. For instance, AWF gathers information when you fill out forms on the Sites, including, for example, e-newsletter sign-up forms, donation forms, and advocacy-related forms. We may supplement the information we collect from you with information we collect from and about you from other online and offline sources, such as public databases, social media platforms and from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms. For example, if you choose to connect your social media account to your Site account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us. This may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.
Our service providers and we may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
We use “cookies” to help us monitor traffic and collect information about the use of the Sites. Cookies are pieces of data placed on your device when you visit the Sites that help us recognize you when you come back to the Sites, allowing us, for instance, to remember the email address and password you use when you log in on a specific device. AWF uses the aggregated information collected from cookies to measure the number of visits to the Sites, the average time spent on the Sites, the identity and number of pages viewed and to gather other traffic data and information that allows us to improve the Sites. We also use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Sites. Cookies further allow us to select which of our content is most likely to appeal to you and display it while you are on the Sites.
AWF also uses a variety of third-party web and mobile app analytics and optimization services to improve the Sites and enhance the visitor experience. For example, the Sites use a web optimization platform that may use technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze behavior, gather demographic information and improve site administration. The Sites do not use these services to collect any personally identifiable information not otherwise provided by you in using the Sites, and they do not track your browsing habits across other third-party websites on our behalf. For more information regarding these practices, please visit the privacy policy of our web analytics service by going to https://www.optimizely.com/privacy.
We also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about Site use anonymously and report website trends, without identifying individual visitors. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your devices, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version.
We may collect your IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. This is a common practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Sites.
We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.
Information that you provide, such as your preferred means of communication, does not personally identify you unless it is combined with your Personal Information.
We may aggregate Personal Information. Aggregated information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).
How We Protect Your Information
AWF uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to provide you with the safest, most secure experience possible. SSL technology enables encryption of sensitive information, including login credentials, passwords, and credit card numbers, during your online transactions. All of the forms on our site are secured with SSL technology so your personal information stays safe and out of malicious hands.
