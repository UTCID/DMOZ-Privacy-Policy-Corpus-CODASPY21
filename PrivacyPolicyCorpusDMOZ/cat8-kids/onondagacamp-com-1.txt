Privacy Policy
In order to meet the needs of our campers and have the ability to care for them we must collect personal information about them and their families. All of the information gathered is stored in our files which are secured in our locked offices and processed in a secure database with access controls. The information is given only to those staff who are directly involved in providing a service to your camper, or as required by law. When information is given to a service provider employed by Onondaga Camp Co. Ltd., we have made certain that the service provider and its employees have a Privacy Policy that prevents them from using the information for any other purpose than that for which they were hired. We do not sell or rent your family information to any company, organization or individual. Even when asked for any personal information of a camp family by other camp families, we will not provide them with any information without first asking for consent by the family about which the information was requested. Besides the care and transportation of your camper and our ability to communicate with you and your family, we do use the information on hand for statistical analysis for our camp, and to develop programs required for the future. We do retain your information to enable us to communicate with you in the future, provide your camper with recognition for time spent at camp, provide you with information about our programs, and inform you of information that we feel may be of interest to you.
Great Adventures Start Here A true Canadian summer tradition, Onondaga Camp offers an extraordinary environment for kids to play, explore, achieve and grow. Situated on the shore of Middle Bob Lake near Minden, Ontario, Onondaga inspires the best in outdoor fun, learning and adventure for girls and boys from six to 16 years old. Building upon our legacy in this rustic northern setting, we are a progressive camp with
fully modern amenities, offering the kinds of activities that kids today really want.
