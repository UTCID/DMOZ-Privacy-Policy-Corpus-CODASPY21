Modification of Terms. We reserve the right to modify this Agreement from time to time. Your use of the Site after such a modification will constitute your acceptance of those changes. We may notify you of any such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised version of this Agreement to the Site. You can determine when we last changed this Agreement by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” date above.
Your Access to and Use of the Site.Your access to and use of the Site may be interrupted from time to time, including due to technical malfunctions, periodic updating and repairs.  We may, at any time, modify or discontinue all or part of the Site, charge, modify or waive any fees required to use the Site, or offer opportunities to some or all Site users.  We may, in our discretion and without notice, suspend or terminate your access to the Site and to any services offered on the Site, and may remove and delete any content you have provided if we believe that your conduct or content violates or is inconsistent with this Agreement or its intent, that your conduct is disruptive, or that you have violated the law or the rights of any third parties.
Requests to be Matched. Some of our Sites provide you access to certain services, such as referrals to products, services, suppliers and service providers that may be of interest to you (the “Site Services”), and to certain content provided by us or by third parties, such as news and information regarding such products, services and supplies in various industries (the “Site Content”). PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:
Services. Certain of our Sites provide you with the opportunity to submit requests (each, a “Request”) for information on a wide variety of products and services offered by certain service providers (each such service provider, a “Service Provider”). We cannot and do not guarantee that these Service Providers will provide information for every Request received or that the Service Providers who do respond to your Request can in fact meet all of your requirements. We may reject any Request and/or elect not to forward a Request to participating Service Providers, for any reason or no reason.  Subject to certain exceptions below, the Site acts solely as a paid marketing lead generator.  QS may receive a marketing lead generation fee from the Service Providers.  You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available product or service and Service Provider best suits your needs.
Transfer of your information. In submitting a Request to be matched on the Site, you agree to allow us to transfer all of your information in connection with your Request to matching Service Providers, whether or not you have specifically selected such Service Provider. If any Service Provider(s) wish to provide information to you in connection with your Request, you will be contacted regarding the offerings and related pricing. Please notify the Service Provider(s) directly if you no longer wish to receive communications from them. The Service Provider(s) may keep your Request information and any other information provided by us in connection with your Request whether or not they offer you a product or service.
Additional Terms Applicable to Financial Services Requests.
Financial Services Requests, Generally. Our Sites provide you with the opportunity to submit Requests for information and to be matched with financial services Service Providers, such as insurance companies, mortgage lenders, and personal loan lenders (collectively, “Financial Services Requests”). Subject to the limited exception below, a Financial Services Request is not an application for insurance, credit or a request for a loan pre-qualification; rather, it is an inquiry to be matched with Service Providers. As such, QS does not make any decisions regarding the products and services offered by the Service Providers and does not make any underwriting, loan or credit decisions. Subject to the limited exception below, QS is not your agent, the agent of any Service Provider, nor a broker, lender, creditor for or issuer of the products featured on these Sites.
Exception: Automobile Insurance Policies. If you submit a Financial Services Request for automobile insurance coverage, QS may match you with one or more quotes from our Service Providers. In some cases, QS also may offer you the ability to purchase automobile insurance policies directly through its website Insurance.com (Auto Policy Sale).  The services provided in connection with the purchase of automobile insurance policies through Insurance.com are offered by QuinStreet Insurance Agency, Inc.  In connection with Auto Policy Sales, QS would act as the agent on behalf of these companies offering insurance policies directly to you.
Authorization to Obtain Full Social Security Number, Credit Report and Credit Score. You understand and agree that by submitting your request to be matched with Service Providers on certain Sites, you authorize QS under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to obtain your full Social Security Number, credit report, and credit score from a credit reporting agency to verify your identity and to match you with lenders or Service Providers.  You understand and agree that you are also providing written instruction under the FCRA for these matching Service Providers separately to obtain your credit report, credit score, and other information from one or more credit reporting agencies in order to verify your identity and provide you with prequalified quotes. In submitting a Financial Services Request, you agree to allow us to transfer this information, including your social security number, in connection with your Financial Services Request to matching Service Providers, whether or not you have specifically selected such Service Provider. You further expressly authorize any Service Providers with whom you are matched to share among its affiliates, loan servicers, and bank partners any transaction history related to your financial products or services received or serviced through such Service Provider for the limited purpose of evaluating you for credit.
No guarantee of insurance, loan or credit. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will be matched to any Service Provider, that any Service Provider will make a loan or offer to you, or that any program terms including any specific loan terms or rates, offered by the Service Providers are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. A Service Provider’s offer may be subject to market conditions, approval and qualification.  The rates and fees you actually achieve may be higher or lower depending on your complete credit and financial profile. Your ability to secure any loan or consummate any transaction with any Service Provider is solely a matter to be resolved between you and such Service Provider. You may have to complete an application with, and pay an application fee to, the Service Provider before they extend an offer to you or provide that Service Provider with additional information to enable them to further verify your income.
No endorsements or recommendations. In working with Service Providers, we seek to work with companies that are reputable and professional; however, we strongly recommend that you perform your own due diligence on each potential Service Provider prior to selecting and/or entering into any type of agreement or other arrangement with any particular Service Provider.  In addition, once we refer your Request to the Service Providers, QS has no further involvement in any transactions that occur between you and the Service Provider(s).  QS neither recommends nor endorses any specific products, opinions, or other Site Content that may be made available through or mentioned on the Site.
QS is not responsible or liable for any Service Provider’s acts or omissions including for any quotes or services that any such Service Provider may provide, for any Service Provider’s contacting or failure to contact you, for any Service Provider’s performance or failure to perform any services, or for any agreement or transaction between you and any Service Provider.
No substitute for professional advice. We provide all Site Content and Site Services solely for your convenience, and such Site Content and Site Services (i) are not intended as a substitute for professional advice; (ii) should not be construed as the provision of advice or recommendations; and (iii) should not be relied upon as the basis for any financial decision or action.  We are not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any Site Content or the Site Services.  Site Content is not exhaustive and should not be considered complete or up-to-date.  It is your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any Site Content or Site Services available through the Site.  The relationship between you and us is not a professional or similar relationship; always seek the advice of a qualified professional with respect to any questions that you may have, and never disregard professional advice or delay in seeking it because of something that you have read on the Site.

Indemnification.You agree to indemnify and hold QS, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, and Service Providers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Site, the violation of this Agreement by you, or the infringement by you, or other user of the Site using your computer, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. Even though prohibited, people may provide information that is offensive, false, harmful, or deceptive. QS and its Service Providers assume no responsibility whatsoever for such content or actions.
RELEASE.YOU HEREBY RELEASE, REMISE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE QS AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, INFORMATION PROVIDERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND LICENSEES, AND ALL OTHER RELATED, ASSOCIATED, OR CONNECTED PERSONS FROM ANY AND ALL MANNER OF RIGHTS, CLAIMS, COMPLAINTS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LEGAL FEES, COSTS, AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY NATURE AND KIND WHATSOEVER AND HOWSOEVER ARISING, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST, WHICH ARISE FROM, RELATE TO, OR ARE CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE.
Mandatory Agreement to Arbitrate on an Individual Basis.Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, counts, claim, or cause of action) between you and QS or QS's employees, agents, successors, or assigns, shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration, except that you or QS may take claims to small claims court if the dispute qualifies for hearing by such a court. In addition, each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration and arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, APART FROM THE NARROW EXCEPTIONS ABOVE, YOU AND QS ARE EACH WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO RECEIVE A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING .
Arbitration shall be subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and shall be conducted by Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS ”) pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The JAMS Rules, including instructions for bringing arbitration, are available on its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. The Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/.
You and QS must abide by these rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action and the arbitrator shall not award class-wide relief; (b) QS will pay its arbitration costs as required by JAMS rules, and in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, QS will pay as much of your arbitration filing and hearing fees as the arbitrator deems is necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees and costs unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation costs, and in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
With the exception of subpart (a) in the paragraph above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in the paragraph above is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or U.S. federal court in California.
Claims of Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it.  If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.  Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.  See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.  Notices and counter-notices should be sent to:

We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before submitting a notice or counter-notice.
Governing Law.The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (without regard to conflict of law provisions thereof). If any provision(s) of the Agreement is held contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect. The failure of QS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by QS in writing. The section titles in the Agreement are used solely for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance.
Jurisdictional Issues.The Site is controlled and/or operated from the United States, and is not intended to subject us to non-U.S. jurisdiction or laws, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement.  The Site may not be appropriate or available for use in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.  In choosing to access the Site, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations, including any export controls, embargoes or other rules and regulations restricting exports.  We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.
Complete Agreement.Except as expressly provided in a particular notice or disclaimer posted by or on behalf of QS on this Site, these Terms of Service, including our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and QS with respect to the use of the Site and Site Content.
