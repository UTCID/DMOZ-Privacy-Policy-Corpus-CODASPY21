Copyright Statement
Items in the UNT Digital Library are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.
The contents of the UNT Digital Library are made publicly available by our contributing partners for use in research, teaching, and private study.
Although the nature of archival and manuscript collections sometimes makes it difficult to determine the copyright status of an item, it is your responsibility to use it according to all applicable terms.
Please contact the contributing partner for additional information regarding copyright status of a particular digital image, text, data set, or sound or video recording.
Conditions of Use
By using the digital images, texts, data sets, audio and video recordings, and other materials in the Digital Library, you agree to follow these conditions of use:
Responsibility for any use of these materials rests exclusively with the user.
Some materials in these collections may be protected by the U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S.C.). In addition, the reproduction of some materials may be restricted by terms of gift or purchase agreements, donor restrictions, privacy and publicity rights, licensing and trademarks. Transmission or reproduction of materials protected by copyright beyond that allowed by copyright law requires the written permission of the copyright owners.
When using items from the UNT Digital Library, please give proper credit to the contributing partner and the Digital Library.
Access
Due to licensing agreements and/or university policies, some materials in the UNT Digital Library are available only to members of the UNT community.
Depending upon the degree of restriction, you may need to log in with your UNT EUID to view or listen to the restricted item.
In very rare instances the restriction may require use within the Libraries' buildings.
Privacy
The following sections provide specific information about how we collect and use data on the UNT Digital Library.
You may also want to review the UNT Libraries' Digital Collections Usage and Feedback Policy for relevant information.
Privacy and Cookies
We collect anonymous statistics about visitor behaviors to enhance our understanding of ways everyday users like you use this site.
This information also allows us to provide additional functionality that, we hope, will improve your experience.
Like many websites, we do this by storing small, often temporary, text files in your browser. Examples of the kinds of data we collect are: aggregated counts of pages viewed, technical details about the browser, interface elements you clicked on, and how far down a page you scrolled.
By collecting this information, we (the site maintainers) can discover:
Larger patterns of site use.
Popular content.
Underutilized features.
It also allows us to:
Provide short introductory tutorials to new users, but hide the tutorials on return visits.
Show users which items they've visited during their online session.
Display or hide targeted notifications.
Collecting and Sharing Personal Information
We do not know personal identifying information such as your name or email address unless you provide it to us in a feedback form, sign up for an email newsletter, or interact with us on social media. Even if you provide us such details, we cannot and do not tie your personal information to a browsing session history.
In order to collect and analyze data about site visits, we use the most recent version of Google Analytics, setting it to anonymize your IP address as early as possible in the data-transmission process. You can learn more about Google Analytics.
In order to provide the fastest possible experience to you, we also employ content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver commonly available CSS and JavaScript files to your browser. This technique is used by sites all over the world, but since these files are provided by third party networks we cannot make absolute claims about privacy.
If you employ ad-blocking or use other means to block commonly used CDNs, we attempt to fall back to local copies of the files.
In all cases, we will not sell or knowingly provide information to advertisers or other third parties with one exception. As an educational site, we will use aggregated data about site visits in scholarly communications with our peers.
Disabling Cookies and Browser Storage
You can use your browser's controls to restrict the use of cookies and local or session storage.
Here is advice for how to do this in:
Internet Explorer
Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Apple Safari
You can also opt out of Google Analytics if you wish. Various third party browser extensions and tools allow you to block Google Analytics as well.
Updates
We may update this information from time to time.
You can always check back here for the latest information.
