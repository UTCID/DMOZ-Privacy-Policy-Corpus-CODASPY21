The List Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price may represent “open-stock” prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer’s estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. Where an item is offered for sale by one of our merchants, the List Price may be provided by the merchant.With respect to items sold by RKS, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mis-priced. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.Please note that this policy applies only to products sold and shipped by RKS. Your purchases from third-party sellers using RKS Payments are charged at the time you place your order, and third-party sellers may follow different policies in the event of a mis-priced item.RETURN POLICYReturns are easy.  If for any reason you are not satisfied, you can return the product for a full refund less a processing fee or exchange.Returns and Refunds must use the Return Form and receive an RMA.Refund requests will incur a processing of fee of $5.95.  This fee will be deducted from your refund amount.Click here to fill out our Returns and Exchanges form and we will process your request promptly.Return shipping is the responsibility of the purchaser.LOST OR BROKEN GUARANTEEOur Lost or Broken Guarantee allows customers to register their purchase for one replacement pair.  Customers must register their product within 30 days of purchase.  The Guarantee is good for one year from date of registration.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITYTHIS SITE AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED BY RKS ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.
