Dementia is the term used to describe the symptoms of a number of illnesses that affect the brain. The most common cause is Alzheimer's disease, but there are other causes, including Parkinson's disease. Common early symptoms include memory loss, confusion, personality changes, apathy and withdrawal. Early diagnosis is important to help with early treatment, planning and support. Medications might help some symptoms of dementia, but there is no cure.
