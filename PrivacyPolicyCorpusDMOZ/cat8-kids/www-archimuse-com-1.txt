Privacy Policy
Archives & Museum Informatics no longer actively maintains a mailing list.
We do not sell, share, or trade the now out-of-date list we have.
Conference Delegates Listings
Lists of attendees were circulated in printed
form at our Conferences, to enable delegates to contact each other after the
event. Attendees lists are not intended to be used for commercial marketing
purposes, and are not available in electronic form. We ask all conference participants
to respect the privacy of their colleagues. Delegates can opt-out of being
on the list when they register.
Site Update Policy
Past conference Web sites are
static publications documenting each event. They are kept online to provide a record of the presentations made and to give access to the papers presented. We do not update past papers, nor do we maintain links; some linked sites may no longer be available. Presenter biographies were correct at the time of the conference; they are not edited or updated after the conference.
Publications by David Bearman and Jennifer Trant are online here as a professional courtesy. All links were current at the time of publication.
Informatics: The interdisciplinary study of information content, representation, technology, and applications,
and the methods and strategies by which information is used in organizations, networks, cultures, and societies.
