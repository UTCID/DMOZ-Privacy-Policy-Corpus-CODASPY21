Minimum reserves and liquidity
These data refer to minimum reserve requirements and
liquidity conditions in the euro area, i.e. the Eurosystem’s supply of liquidity
in euro, and credit institutions’ demand for this liquidity. These statistics
may be of use to treasurers, money market analysts and researchers.
Minimum reserve requirements
Euro area banks are required to hold minimum reserves in
their current accounts at their national central bank. A bank’s minimum reserve
requirement is set for six-week maintenance periods. The  level of reserves is calculated on the basis
of the bank’s balance sheet before the start of the maintenance period.
The annual and quarterly data on minimum reserve
requirements refer to averages of the last maintenance period of the
year/quarter. As of 10 March 2004 maintenance periods start on the settlement
day of the main refinancing operation (MRO) following the Governing Council’s
assessment of the monetary policy stance.

Autonomous liquidity factors
These forecasts refer to average autonomous liquidity factors published by the ECB.
They are expressed as daily averages.
The
frequency of data is weekly: the ECB publishes a forecast each time a main
refinancing operation (MRO) is announced and updates it when the operation is allotted.
Please note that as of publication date 24 September 2018 the forecast average autonomous factor figures are in EUR millions.

Benchmark allotment
This
is the allotment amount in the main refinancing operations (MRO) that allows counterparties
to smoothly fulfil their reserve requirements, taking into account the expected
liquidity supply through other open market operations, the ECB’s forecast of
autonomous factors and excess reserves.
The
frequency of data is weekly: the ECB publishes the benchmark allotment each
time an MRO is announced and updates it when the
operation is allotted.
Please note that as of publication date 24 September 2018 the data for the benchmark allotment amount are based on the benchmark calculation date and reflect the benchmark horizon.
