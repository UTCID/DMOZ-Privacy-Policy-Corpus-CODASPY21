time violated the following eligibility requirements:
You must be at least 13 years of age to access the website or its services.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we
inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose
personal information
from children under 13 years of age. FunTrivia does NOT allow users under 13 years of age
to register for an account or use the FunTrivia.com website alone. We do have a collection
of trivia quizzes that may be suitable for children (this is ultimately a parent's responsibility), but these may only be used under supervision of a parent or guardian.
FunTrivia content is not guaranteed for accuracy or completeness.
This applies
to our publicly available content AND our trivia question products: FunTrivia aims to be as accurate as possible
when it comes to presenting accurate trivia question and quiz content. .
However, FunTrivia does not warrant that
any trivia content
is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or
error-free. In most instances, trivia content on
FunTrivia.com has been submitted by other Subscribers, and has not been verified or thoroughly researched, and
inaccuracies are very likely to exist. FunTrivia.com is NOT a researched encyclopedia. It is ultimately
your responsibility to check and validate any content
originating from FunTrivia.com.
We provide our content for
entertainment purposes only.
FunTrivia is not responsible for the accuracy of trivia questions and is
not responsible for problems that may arise from the use of incorrect or incomplete trivia questions,
either on the FunTrivia.com website or used externally, whether used under license or otherwise.
One account per person.
You may not create or play under more than one FunTrivia account.  Players found to be using more than one
account
will
have all accounts closed.
You agree not to attempt to reverse engineer, breech security measures
of or otherwise access FunTrivia for reasons other than standard game
play.
FunTrivia content (text and images) are
copyrighted under U.S. and Int'l law, you therefore agree not to
electronically copy or redistribute any content gained from

advantage.

at any time without notice for any reason at its sole discretion.
You understand that FunTrivia player scores and awards will not be "reimbursed" or "undone" due to system bugs, network
errors, personal computer issues, or any other reasons.
It is simply not practical.
You agree to respect and abide by rules and directions laid out by FunTrivia volunteer editors and moderators.
These
volunteers help
keep our community spam and abuse-free, and may moderate/delete content or terminate your account at any time for any reason.
You have read and understand the content of our privacy policy.

If a Subscriber does post material for which you own the copyright to, we will gladly remove it from the FunTrivia website upon request.
To expedite the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act ("DMCA")'s copyright infringement process, we recommend that you simply report an infringement here: select "Use of FunTrivia Content >
Infringement", and we will investigate as soon as possible, and
will immediately remove any offending material
for which you show sufficient evidence of infringement.
If you desire the more formalized process, FunTrivia processes, investigates, and responds to notifications of
alleged infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable intellectual property laws.
Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying with the
DMCA, FunTrivia will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to
any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of

Notices of claimed infringement should be
directed to:
Registered Copyright Agent

3460 Marron Rd #103-221
Oceanside, CA 92056
If FunTrivia removes or disables access to any of the materials that are
claimed to be infringing, FunTrivia may attempt to contact the owner of
such materials in order to give such owner an opportunity to respond to
the notification, although FunTrivia makes no promise to do so. Any and
all counter notifications submitted by such owner will be furnished to
the complaining party. FunTrivia will give the complaining party an
opportunity to seek judicial relief in accordance with the DMCA before
FunTrivia replaces or restores access to any material as a result of any
counter notification.
FunTrivia will respond to all other notifications of claimed
infringement of intellectual property rights in accordance with
applicable laws.
Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3), a notification of claimed infringement related to FunTrivia
must be a written communication addressed to the designated agent as set forth above, and must include substantially all of the
following:
A physical or electronic signature of the owner (or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed;
Specific identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by
a single notification, a list of each copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
Information related to the work(s) reasonably sufficient for FunTrivia to promptly locate the work (e.g. title of work, location
within the Website, etc.);
Information reasonably sufficient to permit FunTrivia to directly contact the complaining party, such as a complete name and
address, telephone number, and an email address;
A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the work(s) in the manner complained of is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement requesting that FunTrivia take a specific act with respect to the alleged infringement (e.g., removal, access
restriction or disablement); and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is
authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
TRADEMARKS AND NAMES. Some Funtrivia quizzes use the names of famous people, places,
products, and large companies in trivia questions, and such trademarks may be mentioned in other Services, such as message boards.
If
you disapprove of a trademark's use on FunTrivia.com, or happen to be the subject of trivia questions (i.e. an actor, recording artist,
etc) and wish trivia about you to be removed,
please report it here and we will remove the content.
INAPPOPRIATE CONTENT. We do our best to ensure that hateful, disrespectful, profane, or
otherwise inapporpriate material stays off FunTrivia. In addition to basic profanity filters, some parts of the website are lightly
moderated by volunteers. Still, there is always the possibility that such content will make its way onto our website. Please report it here and we will remove the content and
deal with the offending user expeditiously.
