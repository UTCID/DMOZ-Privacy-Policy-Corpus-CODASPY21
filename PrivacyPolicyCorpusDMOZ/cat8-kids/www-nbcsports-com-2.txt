Occasionally we may make changes to any portion of the Service and/or Terms

Arbitration Agreement - For users outside of Switzerland and Germany
We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive
way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.
Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, if you have any dispute or disagreement with
us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Service (including
this Site), (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with
NBC Sports Gold made through the Service, or (iii) any data or information
you may provide to NBC Sports Gold or that NBC Sports Gold may gather in
connection with such use, interaction or transaction conducted through the
Service (collectively, "NBC Sports Gold Transactions or Relationships"),
you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court or have a jury
decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in
any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, by clicking to indicate your agreement
to these Terms of Service and by using or interacting with the Site or the
Service, or engaging in any other NBC Sports Gold Transactions or
Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then
any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent
jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints,
disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, by agreeing to these Terms of Service and by
using the Service, you agree that, if those efforts fail, any complaint,
dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBC Sports Gold, and any
claim that NBC Sports Gold may have against you, arising out of, relating
to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our	Privacy Policy, or your
subscription, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding
arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS")
and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And
Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the
amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect
(respectively, the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found
at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no
longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American
Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA") instead, and conducted
in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that
time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances). If JAMS
(or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Consumer
Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of
Procedural Fairness or successor or analogous policies in effect which
would be applicable to the matter in dispute ("Minimum Standards"), NBC
Sports Gold agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you
to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration
provisions set forth herein, provided however, that in no event may such
Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or
(i) below. Furthermore, this Arbitration Agreement shall not prevent any
party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court
of appropriate jurisdiction.
You further agree that:
Single Arbitrator
. The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator
selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement
between you and NBC Sports Gold (the "Arbitrator");
Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement
. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency,
shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under
or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or the
arbitration provisions in this Arbitration Agreement, including, but
not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of
Service is void or voidable;
Location of Arbitration
. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by
JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules
(provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does
not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of
business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed
upon by you and NBC Sports Gold; or (iii) at your election, if the only
claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than
$10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.
No Class Relief
. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBC Sports Gold's
individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to
entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis,
or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who
may be similarly situated;
Written Award
. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement
of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of
the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to
it (an "Award"). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant
party or its assets;
Arbitration Costs
. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
NBC Sports Gold will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to
prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the
outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your
claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
Reasonable Attorney's Fees
. In the event you recover an Award greater than NBC Sports Gold's last
written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to
include in the Award NBC Sports Gold's reimbursement of your reasonable
and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the
Arbitration, but NBC Sports Gold shall in all events bear its own
attorneys' fees; and
Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause
. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable
Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not
contained herein. If, however, subpart D is found to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration
provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBC Sports Gold
shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring
any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Modification of Arbitration Clause with Notice
. NBC Sports Gold may modify these arbitration provisions, but such
modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after NBC Sports
Gold has given notice of such modifications and you have agreed to such
modification that satisfies the written agreement and text requirements set
out above and shall only apply to claims that arise after the effective
date of such notification.

content relating to the sport you select for the period provided during
sign-up ("Subscription Period"). Although the season for that sport (i.e.
the period during which live matches or events take place), may be shorter,
than the Subscription Period, you will have access to replays of the live
events and other supplemental content for the full Subscription Period. For
more detail about the content available during your Subscription Period
please review our FAQs <insert link/>.
Payment and Fees
. You will be billed upfront for the cost of the full Subscription Period,
in addition to any applicable taxes, transaction fees and other charges and
fees incurred in order to access the Service. You must have Internet access
and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such
may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") for payment.	 You may edit your Payment Method information in your
Account page. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment
Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check
with your Payment Method service provider for details.
Billing Information
. For purposes of your use of the Service, including identification and
billing, you agree to provide the trusted third parties (listed on the
Service at the time of payment) that we have retained to perform billing
and subscription-related functions with true, accurate and complete
information as required by the subscription or sign up process to the
Service ("Subscription Data"), including your legal name, address,
telephone number, e-mail address and applicable billing information (e.g.,
credit card number and expiration date), for the purpose of verifying the
information you provide and billing your credit card or otherwise charging
your account. You agree to maintain and promptly update the Subscription
Data and any other information you provide to us to keep it accurate.
Without limiting any other provision of this Subscription Agreement, if you
provide material information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, we
reserve the right to suspend or terminate your user account or subscription
and refuse any and all current or future use by you of the Service. You
must check your Account page to determine whether your Subscription Data is
current and accurate, and, if not, to correct or update your Subscription
Data, including your billing information.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient
funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information,
you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
Price Increases
. We reserve the right to increase charges and fees, or to institute new
charges or fees at any time, upon reasonable advance notice as contemplated
in this Subscription Agreement and communicated to you through a posting on
the Service or such other means as we may deem appropriate from time to
time (including e-mail or conventional mail). Such price increases will be
applied on a prospective basis and you will be notified about the increase.
You have the right to terminate this Subscription Agreement within 30 days
of such notice. After expiry of this notice period, the changes will become
effective.
Automatic Renewal

method, you authorize us to charge your payment method at the start of your
billing period and, where applicable, at the start of each renewal period,
unless you terminate or cancel your subscription in accordance with Section
4 before the relevant renewal period begins.
Each time you are charged for your renewal, the renewal charge will be the
same as the prior period's charge, unless (a) you were eligible for a
discounted rate but are no longer eligible for that discounted rate, in
which case your renewal charge will be in an amount equal to the
then-current full term regular price for the product you subscribed to; or
(b) we notify you in accordance with this subscription agreement in advance
at the time of sign up or prior to the beginning of the renewal period that
your renewal price will be changing.
We will notify you before the end of your subscription period that your
subscription is expiring and we will provide you with the terms and
conditions that will apply. If you do not cancel your subscription before
the expiration of your then current subscription period, your subscription
will be automatically renewed at the renewal price for the renewal period
you were notified of.
In the event we cannot charge your account, we reserve the right to
terminate your access to the Service.

provide a refund, discount, or other consideration ("credits"). The amount
and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole
