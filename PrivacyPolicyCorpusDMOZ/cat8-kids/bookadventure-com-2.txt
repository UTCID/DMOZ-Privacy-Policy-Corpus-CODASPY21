If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you should not use the Programs. These Terms of Service constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Synergy 1 Group, Inc. (“Synergy 1,” “we,” “us,” and “our”). If you are using the Programs, on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms of Service on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Synergy 1 for violations of these Terms of Service. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before accessing or using the Programs.
The Programs
The Programs help its users to learn and practice various subjects including spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new or improved features to the Programs shall be provided subject to this Agreement. You understand and agree that the Programs are provided “as-is” and that Synergy 1 assumes no responsibility for any mistakes, errors, or omissions, including any unavailability of the Programs or deletion or loss of any data relating to the Programs.
Synergy 1 grants you a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and license to use the Programs. You agree that you will not copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Programs. You agree not to modify the Programs in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the Programs, including (without limitation) for obtaining unauthorized access to the Programs. You agree not to access the Programs by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Synergy 1 for use in accessing the Programs.
Eligibility and Authority
Synergy 1 does not sell the Programs to children, but only to adults who can purchase the Programs with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Programs only with the involvement and consent of a parent, legal guardian, or at the direction of your School. Your School may impose additional policies regarding the use of the Programs, with which you must comply.
If you open a Synergy 1 account to provide the Programs to students in a School, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School with the authority to bind the School to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the School’s behalf. If you contact Synergy 1 to take any action with respect to an account, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority to request such action(s) from or on behalf of the account-holder (e.g., a School or Parent).
The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. If you are a School providing the Programs to children under 13, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents for Synergy 1 to collect information from students under 13 before allowing such students to access our Service. We recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Synergy 1.
User Obligations
In consideration of your use of the Programs, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Program’s registration form (such information being the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Synergy 1 has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Synergy 1 has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse all current or future use of the Programs (or any portion thereof).
Student Accounts
Laws: We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, or “COPPA” by obtaining authorization from parents, school or district for students use of the Programs. In the U.S., Synergy 1 may collect and process student data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). Individually and collectively, we and our School Users agree to uphold our obligations under FERPA, COPPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and with all other laws and regulations governing the protection of student data.
Using Student Data: By submitting, providing us access to, or causing us to receive Student Data, you agree that Synergy 1 may use the Student Data for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School’s or the User’s consent.

Use of Personal Information for Marketing: You agree that Synergy 1 may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to parent, school, teacher, or district administrative users and other non-student users from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, Synergy 1 shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.
Disclosure of Student Data and Third-Party Service Providers: You acknowledge and agree that Synergy 1 may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information to provide their services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data. Synergy 1 shall not share Student Data with third parties other than as described in this Agreement and in the Synergy 1 Privacy Policy, or with consent of the School or parent.
Student Data Access and Deletion Requests: You may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, and we shall comply with such request within thirty (30) days, except that Synergy 1 shall not be required to delete Student Data that has been moved to a personal family account on the Service or as otherwise prohibited by law. A parent or student over the age of 18 seeking to access, modify, correct, or delete personal information in a student account that is connected to a School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification. Synergy 1 is not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data if such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.

Binding Arbitration
In the case of any dispute between you and Synergy 1 arising out of or connected to these Terms of Service or your use of the Programs, the following rules will apply.
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.
For any dispute with Synergy 1, you agree to first contact us at admin@spellingclassroom.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Synergy 1 has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA“) and in accordance with their Commercial Arbitration Rules. Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, or arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA rules. To the extent permitted under AAA rules, the arbitrator may award costs, fees, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to the prevailing party. A decision reached by arbitration will be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment by any court having jurisdiction. You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and that other procedural rights such as discovery and appeal are not available in arbitration.
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SYNERGY 1 ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
Governing Law
Synergy 1 is located in Florida, with our headquarters in Jacksonville. Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, these Terms of Service and any access to or use of the Programs will be governed by the laws of the state of Florida, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, regardless of where you are located in the world.
Venue
Any dispute subject to Binding Arbitration will take place in Jacksonville, Florida. For any other judicial action that may arise between you and Synergy 1, or for which our Binding Arbitration clause is found not to apply, both you and Synergy 1 agree to submit to the venue and personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Jacksonville, Florida.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Synergy 1,  and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) content you submit, post, transmit or make available through the Programs, including without limitation, User Content, (ii) your use or misuse of the Programs, (iii) your connection to the Programs, (iv) your violation of the Terms of Service Agreement, (v) your violation of any applicable law or the rights of another person or entity, (vi) your willful misconduct, or (vii) any other party’s access and use of the Programs with your unique username, password, or other appropriate security code. Synergy 1 reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.
Severability
