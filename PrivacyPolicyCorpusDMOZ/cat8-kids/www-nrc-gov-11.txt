NRC Site Accessibility
The NRC is committed to making every possible effort to ensure that all information on its Web site is accessible. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended in 1998, is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that are used to measure conformance within this law. More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found at www.section508.gov.
For assistance with any accessibility difficulties with NRC documents on our Web site, please contact the staff of the NRC's Public Document Room (PDR). PDR staff may be reached at 301-415-4737, 1-800-397-4209 (voice), or by e-mail at PDR.Resource@nrc.gov.
If you have any comments, concerns, or questions regarding the accessibility of our Web site, please Contact the Web Site Staff. In your message, please include the Web site address or URL and the specific problems you have encountered.
Comments and/or feedback regarding the NRC's Section 508 program can be directed to Section508@nrc.gov.
Complaints regarding noncompliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act should be filed with NRC's Office of Small Business and Civil Rights (SBCR). Click on How to File a Complaint for information about SBCR's complaint process and Standard Form 782 to file an electronic complaint. For additional information, please contact Stephen Smith, Program Manager for SBCR's Outreach and Compliance Coordination Program (OCCP) at 301-415-7380, or OCCPrograms.Resource@nrc.gov.
