Our Policies
PRIVACY POLICY
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to anyone.
SECURITY POLICY
Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
REFUND POLICY
Balance of all camp fees are payable on or before April 1 of the enrollment year.   For registration received after April of the designated enrollment year, no refunds are given.  Deposit of $300 is fully refundable if cancelled by August 1 the year prior to enrollment year. Cancellation by December 31 prior to enrollment year, $150 deposit is refundable.  After January 1 of the enrollment year, the deposit is non-refundable.  Camp Bear Track reserves the right to cancel enrollment if fees are not paid in full by April 1 of the enrollment year.  After April 1, of the designated enrollment year, all fees should be considered due and owing and no refunds shall be given.  The obligations of the camp for counselors, employees, and general expenses are fixed for the summer and the absence of a camper does not lessen operating expenses.
The Directors reserve the right to dismiss a camper when it is deemed to be in the best interest of either the child or camp, or for violation of camp rules.  No refund or reduction will be made for dismissal or withdrawal after April 1 of designated enrollment year.
