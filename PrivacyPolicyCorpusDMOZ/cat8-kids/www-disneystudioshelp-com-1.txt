What if my Digital Movie Code is missing, lost, or blank?
Your Digital Movie activation code can be found in qualifying DVD, Blu-ray and UHD cases. The Digital Movie code is the same code as the Disney Movie Insiders code.
If your Digital Movie code was missing, lost, or blank, please submit an email via our Contact Us page. When contacting us, please be sure to include the following information:
- Movie title and 6-digit stock number listed on the base of the spine of your DVD or Blu-ray package. This number will start with either a 0 or a 1.
- The store from which your movie was purchased.
What should I do if I get an "invalid code" error message when I try to redeem my Digital Code?
If you receive a "This is not a valid code" error message when you try to enter your code at RedeemDigitalMovie.com, please try the following troubleshooting tips:
- Verify your purchase includes a Digital Code. Please see the insert for further details.
- Verify your Digital Code is eligible on RedeemDigitalMovie.com. Check the text printed on the outer edge of one of the movie discs or on the bottom of the combination packaging from which you obtained your digital code. If you see the words "Distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment" in these locations, the digital code included in your combination package is redeemable on RedeemDigitalMovie.com.
- Verify you are entering the correct characters; some letters and numbers look similar and use of incorrect characters may be causing the error message. For example, B vs. 8, S vs. 5, 0 vs. O, I vs. 1 and W vs. VV.
If you have confirmed that the digital code enclosed in your combination product packaging is entered correctly but you still receive an error message, please submit an email via our Contact Us page to request a new code.
What is a Digital Movie Code and how does it work?
A Digital Movie Code is an alphanumeric Code printed on a paper insert included inside combination disc + code packages (which include a DVD, Blu-ray, and/or 4K/UHD disc(s) and a digital code).  Such Codes can be redeemed through Movies Anywhere or RedeemDigitalMovie.com for licensed access to a digital version of the movie with the participating provider of your choice from any compatible web browser on a compatible connected device.
