2. What Information Do We Collect?
2.1. Visitor and User Information
We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely
personal information and aggregate information.
Personal Information
As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that
specifically identifies an individual.
The Personal Information collected by us mainly consists of contact
details (e.g., email address or phone number), billing details (name,
physical billing address, payment method, and transaction details),
details regarding a browsing or usage session (IP address, and
Geo-location), details regarding connected third-party accounts (such
as the email or username for a connected PayPal, Google or Facebook
account), scanned identification documents provided to us (such as an
ID card, driver’s license, passport or official company registration
documents), correspondences (including those made through or uploaded
to our Services), and any other Personal Information provided to us by
Visitors and/or Users through their access to and/or use of the
Services.
Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate”
information (see below).
Aggregate Information
Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of
services or users from which individual user identities have been
removed.
In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected
and combined with information about how others use the service, but no
personal information will be included in the resulting data.
Aggregate information helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so
that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our
service.
This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our
users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us
better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and
marketing purposes.
2.2. Users of Users Information
We may also collect similar information pertaining to visitors of our
User’s Websites or Services (“Users-of-Users”), on our Users’ behalf
(as further described in Section6 below).
This data is aggregated for our use and for sharing with third parties
as described above.
2.3. Yola Jobs Applicant Information
We also collect information that is provided to us by Yola jobs
candidates (“Applicants”), when they apply to any of the open positions,
by email or otherwise (as further described in
Section7 below).
The Short Version
We collect two types of information: Personal Information
(which could be used to uniquely identify an individual)
and Aggregate Information (which is
non-identifying).
We collect such information regarding our users and visitors, our
users’ visitors, job applicants and anyone else who may provide it to
us.
3. How Do We Collect Such Information?
Active Collection
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you

choose to submit in these forums.

Users-of-Users Information.
The Users controlling and operating such User Websites shall be
considered as the “Controllers” of such Users-of-Users Information, and

including all privacy and data protection laws of all relevant
jurisdictions.

related to his/her work at Yola.

Yola may share your Personal Information with third parties (or
otherwise allow them access to it) only in the following manners and
instances:
8.1. Third Party Services
Yola has partnered with a number of selected service providers, whose services and
solutions complement, facilitate and enhance our own.
These include service providers, hosting and server co-location
services, communications and content delivery networks (CDNs), billing
and payment processing services, domain name registrars, fraud
detection and prevention services, web and service analytics, email
distribution and monitoring services, session recording, performance
measurement data optimization and marketing services, customer service
outsourcing, content providers, marketing agencies and our legal and financial advisors
(collectively, “Third Party Service(s)”).
Such Third Party Services may receive or otherwise have access to our
Visitors’ and Users’ Personal Information and/or Users-of-Users’
Personal Information, in its entirety or in part — depending on
each of their particular roles and purposes in facilitating and
enhancing our Services and business, and may only use it for such
purposes.
Note that while our Services may contain links to other websites or
services, we are not responsible for such websites’ or services’
privacy practices, and encourage you to be aware when you leave our
Services and read the privacy statements of each and every website and
service you visit.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked third-party websites
and services.
Yola is accountable for personal data that it receives under the
Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party as described
in the Privacy Shield Principles.
In particular, Yola remains responsible and liable under the Privacy
Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the
personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the
Principles, unless Yola proves that it is not responsible for the event
giving rise to the damage.
8.2. Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties
Yola may disclose or otherwise allow others access to your Personal
Information pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal
proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with
applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires
us to do so, with or without notice to you.
8.3. Protecting Rights and Safety
Yola may share your Personal Information with others if we believe in
good faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal
safety of Yola, any of our Users, any Users-of-Users, or any member of
the general public, with or without notice to you.
8.4. Social Media Features and Framed Pages
Our Services include certain Social Media features and widgets, such as
the “Facebook Connect” or “Google Sign-in” features, “Facebook Like”
button, the “Share this” button or other interactive mini-programs
(“Social Media Features”).
These Social Media Features may collect information such as your IP
address or which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a
cookie to enable them to function properly.
Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted
directly on our Services.
Your interactions with these third parties are governed by their
policies and not ours.
Our Services utilize the YouTube API which is made available under the YouTube terms of use and Google privacy policy.
In addition, our Services may enable you to share your Personal
Information with third parties directly, such as via page framing
techniques to serve content to or from Third Party Services or other
parties, while preserving the look and feel of our Site and Services
(“Frames”).
Please be aware that if you choose to interact or share any Personal
Information via such Frames, you are in fact providing it to these
third parties and not to us, and such interactions and sharing too are
governed by such third parties’ policies and not ours.
8.5. Yola Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies
We may share Personal Information internally within our family of
companies, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
For example, we may share your Personal Information with co-owned
affiliates which employ Yola employees in the US, Ukraine and South
Africa, in the course of facilitating and providing you (and your
Users-of-Users) with our Services.
In addition, should Yola or any of its affiliates undergo any change in
control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of
substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be
shared with the parties involved in such event.
If we have a good faith belief that such change in control might
materially affect your Personal Information then stored with us, we
will notify you via email and/or prominent notice on our Site of this
event and certain choices you may have regarding your Personal
Information.
Sharing of Personal Information from the European Union, Switzerland,
and the United Kingdom, adheres to the EU–US and Swiss–US
Privacy Shield frameworks. All U.S. co-owned affiliates using the brand
name “Yola” adhere to the Privacy Shield principles.
For the avoidance of doubt, Yola may share your Personal Information in
manners other than as described above, pursuant to your explicit
approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so.
Moreover, Yola may transfer, share, disclose or otherwise use
Non-personal Information in its sole discretion and without the need
for further approval.
In the event that Yola transfers your personal information to a third
party that is acting as an agent, Yola will enter into a written
agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide
at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the
relevant principles, and also requiring that personal data is only
processed for limited and specified purposes.
The Short Version
We may share the information of our visitors, users and their
users-of-users with various third parties, including certain service
providers, law enforcement officials and application developers.
The information may be shared solely in accordance with this policy.

other User Content you upload, publish or otherwise share with Yola or
anyone else.
We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User
Account and User Website, and avoid providing us with any sensitive
information which you believe its disclosure could cause you
substantial or irreparable harm.
Furthermore, email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure
forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any
Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods.
Hosted websites
Users publishing websites to a free subdomain or a custom domain
managed by Yola, will be provided with DDoS protection and DNS
management capabilities.
Yola uses CloudFlare to provide DDoS
protection and DNS services for the Yola Toolset, Yola Site and
customer websites.
A copy of CloudFlare’s privacy policy is available
here.
We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access
to your personal data.
However, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be
disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the
unauthorized acts of others.
If Yola learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
steps.
Yola may also post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
notice of a security breach in writing.
To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should
notify us at privacy@yola.com.
The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or
social security number, national ID, personal health information) on
our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using
secure socket layer technology (SSL).
Credit card details are stored in our Payment Gateway’s highly secure
Payment Vault that is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry’s
Data Security Standards.
If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you
are more than welcome to contact us at
privacy@yola.com.
The Short Version
We are committed to securing your personal information, and use various
security measures to better protect it.
However, as we can’t guarantee absolute protection — we encourage
you to be careful, set a strong password for your account, and avoid
submitting any sensitive information which, if exposed, could cause you
major harm.
15. Public Forums and User Content
Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs, communities and support
forums.
Be aware that any information you provide in any such areas may be
read, collected, and used by others who access them.
To request removal of your Personal Information from our blogs,
communities or forums, feel free to contact us at:
privacy@yola.com.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information
from such areas.
For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment
(e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your
related profile with such third party, you will need to login into such
application or contact its provider if you want to have the Personal
Information you posted through it removed.
In any event, we recommend that you do not post any information (or use
any posting means to post information) you would not want to be made
public on these areas.
If you upload any User Content to your User Account or post it on your
User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any
Service, you do so at your own risk.
We cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public
who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the
circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we
may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance,
password-protected areas on your User Website).
You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or
us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived
pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users)
have copied or stored such User Content.
Again, we recommend that you do not upload or post any information you
would not want to be publicly available.
The Short Version
Please avoid posting any information to any of the public areas on our
Services, or to your own website, if you don’t want it to become
publicly available.
