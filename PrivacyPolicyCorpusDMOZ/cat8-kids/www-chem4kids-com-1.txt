CONTENT ACCESSIBLE THROUGH LINKS FROM RADER SITES AND SEARCH RESULTS
You should be aware that when you are on a RADER Site, there are links to other sites that take you outside of our service to sites that are beyond our control, such as Google banner advertisements and links from Google advertisers, sponsors and content partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding relationship. You acknowledge that when you click on any of the aforementioned links, the sites you are taken to are NOT controlled by us; different terms of use and privacy policy may apply, and we are not responsible for such sites.

RADER USES GOOGLE ANALYTICS TO IMPROVE OUR CONTENT OFFERINGS
Rader is a participant in the Google Analytics Program to help understand how visitors use the Rader sites. You acknowledge that association through the viewing of any Rader web pages. Google Analytics (like the Google AdSense service) uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer. These cookies collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form. There is NO personally identifyable information collected about any users of the site.
The collected data is transmitted to and stored by Google, NOT Rader. The information is used to generate statistical reports on webtie activity and usage. The results are used to help redesign site functionality, develop new content, and assist in site promotions for the Rader sites. Both the use of AdSense and Analytics allows the sites to remain free for use.
The service is used to track such items as page views, length of time on pages, and visit pathways and use. Different terms of use and privacy policy will apply and we are not responsible for the future use of data that is collected by Google.
Once again, as with Google advertisers and search results, we do NOT collect any personal information nor do we have access to any personal information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card information. External sites may collect usage information to assist in content delivery. If there are problems with the service of information collection techniques, you must contact Google. Again, RADER COLLECTS NO PERSONAL DATA and we have no access to transactions or personal data collected by any external sites.
Rader additionally uses Google Analytics to collect information through the Google Analytics Advertising features.
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads and track page usage on our sites through the AdSense and Analytics programs.

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT.
Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions on or through any RADER Sites.
