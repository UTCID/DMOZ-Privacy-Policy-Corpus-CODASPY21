Privacy & Security Statement
Privacy & Security Statement
This website is operated by Texas A&M University (“University”). This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by the University with respect to your use of the tamu.edu website and other University sites which display this Policy (the "Sites") so you can make an informed decision about using the Sites. This Policy also applies to information collected on other websites on our behalf by third-party vendors. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.
Information collection and use
We collect personal information when you voluntarily provide us with information for responding to inquiries, including mail, telephone or electronic contact. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you leave comments on the Sites or in connection with your participation in surveys, social media, contests, games, promotions, and other activities on the Sites. As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) and information about that individual or his or her activities that is directly linked to personal information. We use personal information collected through our Sites for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Sites, to respond to your requests or to monitor the overall effectiveness of the Sites. Information is kept as long as the service for which it was submitted is active.  Information may be retained afterward as a record of the service.

This information may be used to analyze trends, to identify system performance or to create summary statistics. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personal information mentioned above. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.We may also collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience.

These affiliated organizations include the Texas A&M Foundation, The Association of Former Students, the George & Barbara Bush Foundation and the 12th Man Foundation. In recognition of their complementary missions, Texas A&M Foundation and The Association of Former Students maintain a joint database of former student and donor records to provide superior service in a cost effective and efficient manner to both you and Texas A&M University. Information provided to the Texas A&M Foundation and stored on the unified database is accessible to The Association of Former Students.
