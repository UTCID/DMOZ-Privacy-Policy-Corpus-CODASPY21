Passwords
The member who created the youngcuts.com account and whose Payment Method is charged is referred to here as the Account Owner. The Account Owner has access and control over the YoungCuts account.

In addition, if the Account Owner wishes to prohibit others from contacting YoungCuts Customer Support and potentially altering the Account Owner's control, the Account Owner should not reveal the last four digits of their credit or debit card associated with their account, or their email address if they use PayPal as their payment method.
BY SHARING THE YOUNGCUTS SERVICE PASSWORD, THE ACCOUNT OWNER AGREES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSURING THAT HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF USE AND SUCH ACCOUNT OWNER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS.

You may encounter third-party applications (including, without limitation, websites, widgets, software, or other software utilities) ("Application(s)") that interact with the YoungCuts Service. These Applications may import data related to your YoungCuts account and activity and otherwise gather data from you. These Applications are provided solely as a convenience to you, and YoungCuts is not responsible for and does not endorse the consent of such Applications. SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE OWNED OR OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO, ASSOCIATED WITH OR SPONSORED BY YOUNGCUTS AND ARE NOT AUTHORIZED FOR USE WITH OUR SERVICE IN CANADA. Some of these Applications may even use YoungCuts trademarks. Unless otherwise noted by YoungCuts on the youngcuts.com  websites, YoungCuts is not responsible for and does not endorse the content of such Applications. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with these Applications. If you choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use an Application, such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your YoungCuts account. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information relating to your YoungCuts account, you are consenting to the information about your account being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if YoungCuts has not provided such information; and (iii) your USE OF AN APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN OPTION AND RISK, and you will hold YoungCuts Inc. harmless for the sharing of information relating to your YoungCuts account that results from your use of an Application.

In addition, the Application's end user license agreement, terms of use, and/or any other documentation or materials designated by the Application will govern your use of that Application. It is possible that you may be able to revoke an Application's access to your YoungCuts account at any time, but information shared prior to revocation may continue to be viewable within, or otherwise continue to be used by, the Application depending on the policies of such Application. If you have any questions, concerns, complaints, or claims about the Applications, you should contact the support or contact personnel of the Application and not YoungCuts, unless otherwise indicated by us.

Account Access; Identity Protection
You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer or YoungCuts ready device. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or YoungCuts ready device, you should logout and/or deactivate the device before doing so. If you fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access certain of your account information.
If you find that you're a victim of identity theft and it involves a YoungCuts account, you should notify YoungCuts customer service. Then, you should report this instance to all your card issuers, as well as your local law enforcement agency. Also, you should be mindful of any emails requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. These types of emails, also known as phishing emails, can result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to the YoungCuts website and not through a hyperlink in an email, even if it looks official. YoungCuts reserves the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. YoungCuts is not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed on the account by either a representative of YoungCuts or by the automated processes of YoungCuts.
