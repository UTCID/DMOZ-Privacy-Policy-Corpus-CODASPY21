Complete your 2020 exam via video
All AMEB State Offices are now offering Repertoire Video Exams in most instruments with a view to returning to face to face exams as soon as this is possible. This means you can record your repertoire at home, send the video in to be marked by an AMEB examiner and receive the same official AMEB certificate that you would have received in more regular times. Visit your AMEB State Office website for specific information regarding Video/ Recorded exam options available to you.
Complete your music theory exam online
Our innovative AMEB ONLINE Learning & Exams system makes it easy to do your theory exam anytime, anywhere. Available for all grades of Theory of Music, Musicianship and Music Craft.New improvements to the system make this an even more effective tool for students and teachers during this time. These include detailed examiner reports and access for account holders to monitor candidates' progress in the unlimited practice exams.
Screen Sharing Copyright Clearance Licence
We recognise online lessons come with their own challenges like being unable to point out a specific bar or marking on a page. As a temporary solution to this sort of issue, we have negotiated a special licence that will allow teachers to screen share AMEB publications via their chosen online lesson platform.
We hope this free licence will make remote learning a little bit easier, while still protecting the rights and intellectual property of publishers and composers, whose works are represented in our publications. Apply for your free licence here.
Compilation of expert advice on online teaching
We have scoured the internet and come up with a collection of sites and suggestions that you may find useful. Read our collection of helpful online resources below.
