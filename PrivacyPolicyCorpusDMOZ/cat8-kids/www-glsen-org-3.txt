Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions
Our Commitment to Privacy
GLSEN respects the privacy of visitors to all GLSEN hosted websites, including glsen.org, all GLSEN chapter (eg; glsen.org/Austin), and campaign websites, including the Local School Climate Survey at localsurvey.glsen.org, GLSEN’s Shop to Support at shop.glsen.org, and the GLSENUP advocacy center at cqrcengage.com/glsen. This notice explains our online information practices, and to make it easy to find, links to it are posted conspicuously throughout GLSEN's websites. By visiting GLSEN websites you accept the practices described in this notice.
Information Collection and Use
GLSEN gathers aggregate information about website usage and users, such as day and time of visit, pages visited, and devices used. Additionally, our web server automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each visitor to our site, which is only used to track, block, and report hacking attempts. Otherwise, we collect and analyze aggregate information to help us determine how to improve website performance and user experience.
GLSEN also collects personal data from visitors to the site via registration forms, such as event registration, advocacy actions, or email list subscriptions. Completion of any of these forms is optional. The information that is collected via the form is entered into GLSEN's database. Visitors will be subscribed to appropriate lists to receive specific GLSEN email communications and occasional communications by regular mail. Visitors who do not wish to receive communications from GLSEN may opt out at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” from the footer of any GLSEN email or emailing info@glsen.org with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line.
GLSEN complies fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). GLSEN does not knowingly collect identifiable personal information from children under age 13. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will immediately delete that information from our systems. We are unable to reply to information requests directly from children under the age of 13, if so identified. A parent or guardian must initiate any requests for information from children under the age of 13 on their behalf. We encourage parents to supervise children when they browse the Internet.
With the exception of students, GLSEN will occasionally share personal information with partner organizations through promotions, partnerships or otherwise. You may choose to withhold your personal information from exchange by selecting that option by emailing info@glsen.org with “DO NOT SHARE” in the subject line.
When collecting information from individuals who identify as secondary school students, GLSEN will not share, trade or sell contact information to any non-GLSEN individual, group or organization.
How We Protect Your Information
GLSEN holds your personal information to the highest level of confidence and security. Our website is securely protected against the loss, theft, misuse, or misrepresentation of information under our control. Access to GLSEN's database information is limited only to specific qualified GLSEN representatives and relevant vendors (e.g. the company that prepares are physical mailings must have access in order to send you mail on our behalf). Third-party vendors have legal agreements preventing the storage any information from GLSEN's database. Additionally, when you make a contribution to GLSEN online, your financial information is transmitted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser encrypt data before being sent to our payment processor to help prevent fraud.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information to the fullest extent, we cannot ensure or completely guarantee the security of such information. We take the utmost precaution to keep your credit card information safe and secure. Your credit card transaction is processed automatically and your full credit card is never accessible to any human, even for recurring donations.
If you are uncomfortable submitting your credit card information online, you can also contribute to GLSEN by printing out the online form and mailing it in or call us at 212-727-0135.
Text Messaging (SMS/MMS) Policy
GLSEN offers an optional text messaging service to constituents, allowing for short communications regarding relevant and timely events, advocacy calls to action, and campaign opportunities. SMS alerts are available on AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile®, U.S. Cellular®, Nextel, Virgin Mobile, and others. MMS Alerts available only to AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, and T-Mobile subscribers. GLSEN usually sends 2-4 messages each month. Message and data rates may apply.
We will never send unsolicited messages to your mobile phone. If you have not provided your mobile phone number to us, we will endeavor to ensure you do not receive a promotional SMS from us. If you feel you have been subscribed in error, simply text message QUIT to 21333.
We collect mobile phone numbers and consent to send messages when you text message GLSEN’s SMS number (21333) with a short code, such as: GLSEN, signup via website forms or registration for or at a GLSEN related event.
Although we collect mobile phone numbers through each form of contact, GLSEN only subscribes constituents to our text messaging service who provided authorization – either by directly texting GLSEN’s SMS number to opt-in or by agreeing to opt-in during web form completion.
GLSEN utilizes text messaging, along with mail, email, websites, and social media to communicate with constituents regarding local, state, and national actions they can take in support of LGBTQ students, such as:
Contacting elected officials and school leaders on urgent legislative and policy actions needed to support LGBTQ students
Registering to participate or organize in GLSEN events and days of action, like Day of Silence, Ally Week, or No Name-Calling Week
Participating in digital campaigns, such as sharing messages of support for LGBTQ students, photos of local safer schools organizing efforts, participating in an LGBTQ history quiz, or listening to messages from students and celebrity supporters.
Occasional contests giving away safe schools organizing resources to students and educators
If you wish to unsubscribe from GLSEN text messages at any time, simply text message QUIT to 21333. Alternatively, please email info@glsen.org with the subject line ‘Do not call’. You can re-subscribe at any time by text messaging GLSEN to 21333.
We will never seek any confidential/sensitive information through SMS. Examples of confidential information include - PINs, passwords, CVV, expiry date, issue date, mother's maiden name etc. Some text messages may advise you to visit our website (www.glsen.org) for specific campaign details or actions. All text messages to and from GLSEN should use the text messaging number, 21333. If you receive a text message purported to be from GLSEN which was not received from 21333, please write to us at info@glsen.org.
