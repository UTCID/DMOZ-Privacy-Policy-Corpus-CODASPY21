Privacy Policy
The privacy of all our participating teachers and students is very important to us!
Teacher registration information is for identification and verification purposes by the YLI staff only. Registration information submitted by teachers is used only to provide program materials and updates to participants. Names, numerical sequences, and other identifiers of individual teachers and students will always remain private. This information is not distributed to third parties or sold by the University of Virginia, the Center for Politics or the Youth Leadership Initiative.
Further, the Youth Leadership Initiative does not require that teachers use names, either last or first, to identify students participating in YLI programs such as e-Congress and the Mock Election. Such information — whether it is a number, name or combination of numbers and/or letters — is gathered solely to aid teachers in the keeping of accurate records and is not retained by YLI from year to year.
