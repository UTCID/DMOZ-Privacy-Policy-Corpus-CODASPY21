Notice to Candidates Who Are Residents of California.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents, referred to in the law as “consumers,” with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal information, as well as rights to access and control personal information.  Certain information that we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (because it is made available by a government entity) or covered by another federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
To the extent that we collect personal information about you that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below.
Right to information regarding the categories of personal information collected, sold, and disclosed: You have the right to obtain information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, sell, or disclose.  That information is provided in this Privacy Policy.  We collect the categories of information described in the Information We Collect About You section above.  The categories that we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.
Notice to Candidates in the European Economic Area (“EEA”):
Legal basis for processing your personal information: When applying to a position at the Company, you submit your application on a voluntary basis and you consent to share your personal information with us for processing, storage and transfer for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we don’t collect personal information directly from you, we process this information based on our legitimate interest in evaluating your candidacy, processing your application, ensuring that our organization is properly and adequately staffed, and that we can meet our business needs. We also process your personal information for compliance with legal obligations that apply to us.
Retaining your personal information: We will keep your personal information for as long as necessary for the hiring process and/or a legitimate business purpose, including for the purpose of evaluating your candidacy, notifying you about job opportunities, and for satisfying any legal or reporting requirements.
Data Protection Rights: Candidates who are residents in the EEA have a number of rights. If you are a Candidate that is a resident of the EEA, you may request to access or delete your Personal Information. In certain circumstances, you can also request that we transfer Personal Information that you have provided to us. As you are giving your consent by submitting your Information in order to process your application and therefore your Personal Information related to this application, you have the right to withdraw such consent to further use of your Personal Information at any time. For each of the rights described above, you can send your request to us at HRdataprivacy@activision.com. We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities. You can bring the complaint in your member state of residence, place of work or where an alleged infringement of data protection law occurred.

You acknowledge that your Personal Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, in a secure way, where many of our central databases operate, or other countries where the Company or its affiliates or vendors maintain facilities or business operations.
