A. Creation of an Activision Account
Activision will collect certain Information from you when you register with a Property. Personal information collected during registration includes your first and last name, email address, username, and in specific cases, phone number. This personal information is combined with other Information such as your date of birth, country and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services and marketing preferences. Additionally, we collect and combine Information when you link a third party account (e.g., XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, Steam and Battle.net) to your Activision account, such as the username associated with you third party account, and the use of certain Properties may require you to link a third party account to your Activision account.
B. Use of Our Properties
When you visit or use our Properties we collect, process and/or combine Information about your use of those Properties, such as websites you visited before and after you used a Property, browser type and language, IP address, hardware and software information, advertising ID, third party account information (e.g., the username associated with your XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, Steam or Battle.net account), gameplay data, communications, usage data, purchase histories, and Social Media data. We use Cookies and/or similar technologies (collectively called “Cookies”) to do this. In addition, we or our partners also use Cookies and advertising IDs to serve ads in our Properties. Please see our Cookie Policy for more details.
Activision collects, processes, and combines data such as your age, gender, interests, name, email address, gameplay, marketing preferences, customer service, and device-related information.
Activision also publicly displays certain Information about you, including third party account information and gameplay information, on the Properties. For example, your PlayStation username will be displayed on leaderboards if you are a top player in a certain Activision game, whether or not you have an Activision account. If you have synced a third party account with your Activision account, we may make your username available to be searched by other users if you have not opted out of this feature. You may unlink the third party account or prevent it from being searched at any time through your Activision profile settings.
To provide fair gaming experience to all players, Activision uses anti-fraud technologies to prevent any cheating and bad behavior in our games, including monitoring of game play and in-game communications as specified in the applicable terms of use.
C. Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions
When Activision runs contests or promotions on our Properties, we collect certain Information from participants such as their name, address, postal code, email address, phone number, age and/or date of birth, or other information or content submitted by you.

That Information will be combined with other account information and will be used and shared under this Privacy Policy.
D. Interact with Customer Service
To be able to provide you with customer service and assist you with resolving any issues you may have, Activision collects Information from you including your contact details, together with details of your customer service issue and its resolution.
E. Receive Newsletters on Products and Services, Receive Marketing, and/or Surveys
Activision offers you the ability to receive newsletters or marketing periodically by email, in-app notifications, or SMS in eligible countries, about our products and services, or products or services that may be of interest to you. We also, may occasionally send you surveys to improve player experience with our games. At any time, you can manage your preferences from your account settings and stop receiving further newsletters by unsubscribing from the link in the footer of each email we send to you, by opting out of in-app notifications, or by following the instructions in the SMS we send to you. If you are a US resident, you are subject to the SMS Terms of Use.
F. Mobile Advertising
Our mobile games include advertising for third party products and services. By accepting this Privacy Policy and downloading or continuing to play our mobile games, and unless you opt out of interest-based advertising as explained in our Cookie Policy, you consent to us and our advertising partners collecting, sharing and using information about you to show you relevant third party ads that might interest you in our mobile games, and to improve advertising, targeting and measurement systems.
When you play our mobile games, we collect and share Information, including advertising IDs, non-personal identifiers and other information from your mobile device with advertising partners to enable the technical delivery of ads to your device. Our advertising partners may combine this Information with information which they have collected about you when you use their services (or the websites or services of third parties) to serve you more relevant ads in our mobile games or to improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems. We recommend that you review our advertising partners’ privacy policies for more information, accessible in our Cookie Policy.
You can review your options to manage and opt-out of mobile advertising by (1) visiting your mobile device developer's website or reviewing your device manual. Most mobile device developers will tell you how you can manage the settings on your mobile device to opt out of and/or delete Cookies from your mobile device, or to limit the use of your advertising ID, reset your advertising ID, and/or opt out of targeted advertising; or (2) by visiting http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and/or http://youronlinechoices.com, or if you are in the EU http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/, for choices to opt out of advertising. You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an advertisement (where available).
Please note: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant to your interests. We will also still use your device’s advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the same ad from us).
G. Buy Activision Products or Services Online
Activision does not collect credit card and/or billing information when you purchase products or services (such as digital content) online. However, you may have to provide credit card and/or billing information to one of our third-party vendors to complete a purchase. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of our third-party vendors before providing them with your personal information, as their privacy practices may vary from ours. At the time of purchase, in specific cases, you also have the option to provide Information (such as your email address) to Activision to send you additional information or offers.
H. Social Media
You can interact with some Properties through social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or social media plug-ins and applications) ("Social Media"). When you interact with Activision and/or the Properties through Social Media you acknowledge that we access your Information, such as name, username or profile picture, solely under your Social Media privacy settings, and use it to tailor content, marketing, and improve and adjust user experience relating to Activision Properties, and (1) give you exclusive content; (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Properties; and (3) contact you under applicable marketing preferences through Social Media, including through providing tailored marketing, or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.

Click here for details Hide details
Activision takes a range of security measures - designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, and scores, etc.). We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.

You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.
Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information
California residents have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose the categories of your personal information we collect, use, and share. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.
Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information
You may also request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Some information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Properties to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Properties.
How to Exercise Your Access and Deletion Rights
California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting your request to us here or sending an email to ccparequests@activision.com.
For security purposes, we will verify your identity – including requesting information from you – when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. If you have an online account you use to interact with Activision, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.
Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.
Right to Nondiscrimination
We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.
Sale of Personal Information
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), gives California residents the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.
We do not sell information that directly identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address.  We also do not provide customer personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We share certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf for the business purposes we describe above.
We also may allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins.  These advertising entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.  You can set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, by clicking here. You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes.  You may also opt out through the settings page of Activision mobile applications that may share your data for these purposes.  You can find additional information in the Mobile Advertising section above and in our Cookie Policy.
The personal information collected through these methods is associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to opt-out for this information you will need to disable cookies or trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, if you reset your advertising ID or clear your cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so you must opt-out again.
In addition to the opt outs related to advertising above, we support the CCPA by allowing California residents to opt out of any other future sale of their personal information by clicking here. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at ccparequests@activision.com.
Authorized Agents
You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.
California Shine the Light Law
Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, without their approval. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please send us an email to privacy@activision.com, or write us at: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy.

13. Privacy Information for Nevada Residents
Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, and phone number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and service of interest to you and in the other ways described above. We do not believe that our sharing in this regard would qualify as a sale under Nevada law. Nonetheless, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt out by emailing us at individualrights@activision.com. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
