abcteach Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
TERMS OF SERVICE
1.
General
1.1 The abcteach.com public and membership websites have been in operation
since about 2000, providing access to downloadable materials for educators
and parents.
1.2 The abcteach.com website is owned and operated by ABCTEACH LLC, a Michigan
limited liability company. The names "abcteach" and "abctools" are registered
trademarks. As used in this Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, "We" and
"abcteach" and "Site" refer to all websites and services, whether public or
membership, operated or offered by abcteach. Currently we operate under the
following base urls: abcteach.com, and members.abcteach.com.
1.3 abcteach is for use by parents, educators, and others over the age of 18.
The materials made available by abcteach are intended to be used with and for
children and students, among others, at the discretion and under the control,
supervision, and direction of the parents, educators, and other adults who are
visitors, members, or subscribers to the Site. As used in this Terms of Service
and Privacy Policy, "you" refers to such visitors, members, or subscribers.
1.4 By using the Site, you accept and agree to be bound by the following terms.
We may, solely at our discretion, modify or revise these terms and conditions
at any time by updating this web page, and you agree to be bound by these
modifications or revisions. You should visit this page periodically to review
the terms. From time to time, we will require that you confirm your agreement
to the terms.
2.
Usage
2.1 Sharing of password or login information is strictly prohibited. Suspension
of account access may result from sharing of this information.
2.2 Worksheets and other materials available on abcteach, including clip art,
may be printed or otherwise duplicated for use in your home or your
classroom(s). Clip art on abcteach is intended as a resource for you in
creating lessons and teaching materials and the like within your permitted
usage of the Site.
If you are a paid member, our clip art may be: placed on
another publication as clip art, or distributed individually on a third-party
authorship site, if you as a member give abcteach credit for any clip art
intended to be redistributed.
Giving credit to abcteach requires you to
mention our name and website on any publications in which you use our clip art
for redistribution. You may not use our clip art in the design or content of
another website; or distribute our clip art electronically or by email or text
or by any other media or social media. Furthermore, Members are prohibited from
packaging our clip art into their own collections for sale, each clip art
illustration used for resale, must be used individually, again giving credit to
abcteach.com.
2.3 The abcteach copyright appears on every page; we require that this
copyright remain in place on all reproductions.
2.4 Except as provided in section 2.7 below, all of the worksheets and other
materials available on abcteach are intended for non-commercial educational
purposes.
2.5 You may place links to abcteach from your own education website; however,
copying or uploading abcteach resources and documents to your own site is a
copyright violation and will be treated as such. Deep linking is not permitted.
(A "deep link" is a hyperlink that bypasses a website's home page and takes the
user directly to an internal page. For example, instead of linking to the home
page of a newspaper, a deep link might take the user directly to a newspaper
article within the site.) At abcteach, linking directly to a content page
rather than the home page or a directory page is considered deep linking and is
not permitted.
2.6 Under no circumstances may any of the documents, resources, clip art,
worksheets, or other materials (including text, images, or website design) on
abcteach be re-sold or re-distributed without the express permission of
abcteach.
2.7 We may permit you to use abcteach materials in your creation and sale of
educational materials produced by you individually, on sites such as Teachers
Pay Teachers, upon your payment of a separate additional fee and your
submission of an executed agreement as stated elsewhere on the Site. This would
offer you a limited non-exclusive license to use abcteach materials within the
scope of the separate agreement; such permission being terminable at any time
by abcteach in our sole discretion; you agree that you will immediately cease
the use, or offering for sale, or sale, of any such educational materials in
the event we take such action. By using any materials, you acknowledge that
other members may be acting under similar permissions and creating similar
materials.
2.8 If you desire to use abcteach materials in any other manner, or if you have
any questions about permissible uses that are not specifically addressed
here, you should address your inquiry to support@abcteach.
3.

abctools, the abcWorkshop, and other applications, that facilitate the
creation of user-generated word lists, puzzles, worksheets, and other

sole responsibility and not that of abcteach. If any other person, including
children or students, uses your member account to access or use abctools or
abcWorkshop or any other abcteach application, you agree to and assume
responsibility for any such materials.
