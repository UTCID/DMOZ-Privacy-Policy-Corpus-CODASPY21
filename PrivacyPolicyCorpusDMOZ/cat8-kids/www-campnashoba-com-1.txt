CHILD SAFETY
The safety of children is very important to us. We comply with the “Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act”. When a child under age 13 attempts to register with us, we ask that they have a parent or guardian register on their behalf. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the use of personally identifying information from that child.
If a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s information, that parent can send an email to us to request deletion of their child’s account.
Under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. We abide by this requirement.
We do not share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example through email, or in chat areas – that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.
Any questions about this policy statement may be emailed to Info@CampNashoba.com or you may write to us at our head office, once again using the address at the bottom of each page.
