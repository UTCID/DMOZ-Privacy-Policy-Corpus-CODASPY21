Report allergic reactions to packaged food and help us prevent it happening to someone else.
Food labels are required by law to carry essential information so that people know what is in the food they buy.
This includes statements about the presence of food allergens, which are foods known to cause a life-threatening reaction (including anaphylaxis) in people with allergies.
People with allergies are at serious risk unless foods are labelled correctly.
The role of the Food Safety Unit at the Department of Health and Human Services is to ensure that food sold in Victoria is safe.
We can investigate and test food for allergens that are not described on the food label. If a food is not correctly labelled we can make sure it is removed from sale if required.
Please contact the Food Safety Unit immediately
IF
AND
AND
you, your child, or someone in your care is allergic to:
tree nuts
peanuts
milk
egg
fish or shellfish
sesame seeds
soybeans, or
cereals containing gluten
lupin.
you suspect that they have had an allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a packaged food,
the label did not show that the food allergen was present.
The Food Safety Unit needs your help – let us know today so we can act quickly.
Contact us at: The Food Safety Unit
Phone: 1300 364 352 (24 hours a day) or
