My mom is taking me to the gynecologist soon. Does she have to be in the room
with me during the exam? – Frida*
It's up to you if your mom stays in the room with you for your gyn
exam.
Lots of girls feel more comfortable with mom there. Others prefer the privacy of
being alone with the doctor and/or
. Before starting the exam, your doctor or nurse practitioner might ask
if you'd like your mom there or not. Some will automatically ask moms to leave, so
you may need to speak up if you'd like yours to stay!
If your mom is not in the room, your doctor or health care provider will have a
nurse or medical assistant in the room during the exam. Your discussions will be kept
private, so feel free to ask any questions you have. This is a good time to begin
learning about your body and taking charge of your own medical
care.
