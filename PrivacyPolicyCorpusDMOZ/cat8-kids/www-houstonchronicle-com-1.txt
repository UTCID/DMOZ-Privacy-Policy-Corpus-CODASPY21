Beyoncé is following up on her promise "to help as many as we can" in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.
The Houston native launched BeyGOOD Houston on Thursday, an initiative that is reaching out directly to local residents affected by the historic storm.
"Join us as the BeyGOOD team heads to Houston to continue our relief efforts on the ground," reads a statement on the site.
"We have teamed up with Bread of Life and Greater Houston Community Foundation, who have been working with the displaced from the start of Hurricane Harvey's landfall."

BeyGOOD is asking people to donate money to either organization, which will be used for "long-term revitalization" and for immediate purchases, including cots, blankets and pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs.
Beyoncé told the Chronicle exclusively earlier this week that she was working with BeyGOOD Pastor Rudy Rasmus at St. John's in downtown Houston.
"My heart goes out to my hometown, Houston, and I remain in constant prayer for those affected and for the rescuers who have been so brave and determined to do so much to help," she said.
