EPA's Implementation of the Privacy Act
The Privacy Act of 1974 Exit (5 U.S.C. § 552a) mandates how federal agencies maintain records about individuals. The law strives to balance the government's need to maintain these records with the individual's right to be protected from unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Learn more about how EPA implements the Privacy Act.
