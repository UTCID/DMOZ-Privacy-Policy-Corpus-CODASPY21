Ultimately, we want to help students get back on an academic track so they can return to education or move on to college or work.Rob Watson, Director of EducationOur three conditionsBefore a student is accepted at a Red Balloon they must agree to three conditions:They want to be at Red Balloon and will attend regularlyThey want to learn and make academic progressThey will behave with respect and consideration to the other students, the staff, the property and any pets we might have.Our typical student profileThe one feature that our students all have in common is that they had stopped going to mainstream school because they were frightened and felt they would be ‘picked on’ or humiliated. In many of instances, children have been out of school for weeks, months and, in some cases, years.Why children self-exclude from school varies. It might be as a result of being bullied, because they’ve suffered a trauma, a tragedy in the family or their parents’ messy divorce. Also, they may have missed a considerable amount of school already because of an accident or severe illness.Once they stop going to school and believe it is their fault, they can develop mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, self-harm, social phobia, eating disorders, and suicidal thoughts. Over 50% of the children at our learner centres have seriously thought about suicide or attempted it.Our students vary in age, background, ability and interests. Most are between 14 and 15, although on occasion we take children as young as ten, and as old as 17.Some come from single-parent or blended families. Some have siblings, half-siblings and step-siblings, while others are only children. Some are ‘high-flyers’ while others find academic work difficult. Some love creative subjects and some are musical, while others only only factual books, or indeed no books at all. We have children from the independent sector and children from low-income homes, from migrant families and from established local families.Frequently asked questions How many GCSEs can students take? At our Centres it is possible to take up to five GCSEs. Students with Red Balloon of the Air can currently take three, although it may be possible to take five for those who stay for two years. Is there a waiting list? Some Centres have waiting lists, sometimes. It varies. It is probably easiest to contact the Headteacher of the Centre in question to see what availability is like. If there isn’t a space, you might like to also consider Red Balloon of the Air, which is our online and face-to-face service. How much does a place cost? The average cost of a place at a ‘bricks and mortar’ centre is £22,000 pa. The average cost for a student on Red Balloon of the Air is £17,000, although this varies depending on the level of support each child requires.The vast majority of students have Educational Health Care Plans (EHCPs).
