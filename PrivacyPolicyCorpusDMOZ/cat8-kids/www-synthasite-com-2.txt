current fee for the Premium Service you choose on the date that you click on
the "Purchase" button in the ordering process. Our offerings
include Premium Services payable by recurring payments. You agree that Yola
may automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of

"Purchase" button. In the case of domains, you may be billed up to
30 days BEFORE your domain expires - this will vary depending on the Domain
Registrar's terms of renewal (these terms are not governed by Yola).
Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium
Services ("Pre-Payment Plan"). If you opt for Pre-Payment plan,
your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Premium
Service at the commencement of each renewal period.

payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by
agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment
Method. You agree to pay Yola all charges incurred under your account for any
Premium Service in which you or anyone else who uses your account (including
