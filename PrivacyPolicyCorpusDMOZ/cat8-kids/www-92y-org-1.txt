All programs scheduled to occur onsite are subject to state and federal government action, including but not limited to orders, laws, regulations and guidelines, as well as 92Y policies.
In the event that some or all of the meetings of the program cannot happen in person at 92Y, programs will be held at the scheduled time in a virtual format via a video conferencing platform. The programs will continue through hands-on, at-home activities, lectures, presentations, and/or group discussions. No refunds will be issued should any portion of a course be held virtually or if 92Y delays an in person meeting date. Should an in person meeting date be cancelled for a program, a credit for future 92Y programs will be issued.
Participants understand that, notwithstanding 92Y’s cleaning and disinfecting protocols and procedures in conformance with applicable State and Federal regulations, orders, laws and guidelines, 92Y cannot guarantee that its facilities or other individuals present in them are free of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and thus there is a risk involved with returning to 92Y’s facilities relating to exposure to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and the participant and their families could potentially be exposed to these risks by participating in activities at 92Y. By registering for and / or attending any 92Y program, participants, on their own behalf and on behalf of their heirs, successors, assigns, agents and representatives, voluntarily release 92Y and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, volunteers, agents and representatives (“92Y Parties”) from any and all claims, demands, causes of action or liability for any loss, damages, injuries or death (including but not limited to those caused by, arising from or related to COVID-19) that the participant or their families may suffer as a result of entering or participating in or use of 92Y’s facilities, equipment, services or activities, whether the same arises out of or results from any act, omission or conduct of any of the 92Y Parties, negligent or otherwise.
Ticket Policies
Programs, prices and dates are subject to change. There are no refunds unless 92Y cancels an event. If you are unable to use your tickets, you may turn them in to the Box Office up to three hours prior to performance as a tax-deductible contribution. In the case of a postponed or rescheduled event, 92Y is not required to offer refunds if the event is rescheduled within 12 months of the original date. No cash refunds.
Ticket Service Fee
Tickets to events are subject to a service fee of up to $5.00 per ticket or subscription. Please remember to bring your ticket to every performance.
Registration Policies
92Y reserves the right to cancel classes and workshops and to change scheduling. 92Y further reserves the right to substitute instructors or speakers when warranted. Please note that, when cancellations or changes occur, they are often made within one to three days of the program start date. If your program is cancelled, 92Y will make every effort to notify you by telephone or email. For cancelled programs, 92Y will do everything possible to help you find a substitute program; however, when this is not possible, you will receive a 100% refund of the cost of the program. Please register early to help ensure that programs proceed as scheduled.
Confirmation Letters
Your class ID, included in all confirmation letters, is required for admission to all classes and workshops. Please have your class ID with you at all times. If you do not receive one, please contact the Box Office.
When applicable, you will also be given a calendar indicating days that your program will not be held. Please keep it for reference, as this calendar may not necessarily conform to 92nd Street Y's published holiday schedule.
We may ask for contact information for every person attending a program, in addition to the ticket purchaser.
We may be required to ask this information for one of three reasons:
By request of the instructor, the program requires a complete attendee roster.
The class must be purchased with a partner and requires the names of both attendees.
Certain high profile events may have security restrictions that require us to collect full names and email addresses of all patrons attending. Please be aware that a valid photo ID corresponding to the name provided may be required for entry.
Your privacy is important to us. At 92Y, we are fully committed to protecting your privacy.
Registration Processing Fee
Classes and workshops are subject to a processing fee based on the total dollar amount of your purchase. This fee is payable via all methods of purchase.
If the total amount of your registration purchase (for classes, workshops and tours) is:
Up to $75, your fee is $7
From $75.01-$150, your fee is $12
From $150.01-$200, your fee is $17
From $200.01-$300, your fee is $22
From $300.01 and above, your fee is $27
Refund Policy for Classes, Workshops and Outings
In the event that some or all of the meetings of the program cannot happen in person at 92Y, programs will be held at the scheduled time in a virtual format via a video conferencing platform. The programs will continue through hands-on, at-home activities, lectures, presentations, and/or group discussions. No refunds will be issued should any portion of a course be held virtually.
92nd Street Y is not responsible for providing makeup classes or issuing refunds for programs missed as a result of illness, emergencies or other events beyond our control.
There are no refunds for outings, classes or workshops that meet fewer than three times per semester.
If you are unable to attend, you may contact Customer Care prior to the first date for a receipt that enables you to claim your contribution as a tax-deductible gift.
Unless otherwise noted in program description, the following schedule applies to programs which meet three times or more per semester:
To receive a 100% refund, written request must be received 2 weeks prior to the first session.
To receive a 75% refund, written request must be received at least one day prior to the first session.
To receive a 50% refund, written request must be received at least one day prior to the second session.
After that, refunds cannot be granted.
All refund requests must be submitted in writing to Customer Care. Refunds are computed from the date written notice is received.
To receive a refund, you must enclose the original of your confirmation letter.
Please allow three to four weeks for processing of your refund request. Processing fees, membership fees, auditions fees and class or exercise cards are not refundable. No cash refunds.
Scholarship Assistance
Scholarship assistance is available for those who need financial support to participate in 92Y programs and activities. Applications can be obtained in person at Customer Care or by contacting Scholarship Services at 212.415.5699.
