Privacy Policy
FRONTLINE is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to its web sites. As an affiliated web site of the “pbs.org” domain we are governed by PBS Online’s Privacy Policy for ensuring the privacy of all personally identifiable information.
In addition, for any services or communications which are administered directly by FRONTLINE, such as subscriptions to FRONTLINE’s email newsletter or direct email contact with us, FRONTLINE will never obtain email addresses from a third party for our subscriber list nor will we collect or share email addresses obtained from contests, postcards, or the email-a-friend feature of our site.
FRONTLINE will try to give you a cookie to keep track of what local PBS station you’re watching us on. We will never use it for any purpose other than to give you information specific to your PBS local station, for example, local FRONTLINE airtimes. This will only happen if you’ve already gone through PBS’s “Station Finder” to let us know what your local PBS station is. The cookie contains no user-identifiable information. The site will behave normally if you choose not to accept the cookie.
