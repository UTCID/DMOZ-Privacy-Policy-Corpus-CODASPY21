12. Special Notice Regarding Minors
FreshGames, LLC does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If FreshGames, LLC learns that FreshGames, LLC has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 			years of age, FreshGames, LLC will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from FreshGames, LLC’s records.
FreshGames, LLC understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children under 13. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted 						advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13.
FreshGames, LLC also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.
FreshGames, LLC and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features 				served comply with applicable laws of that nation.
FreshGames, LLC and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are 				popular. FreshGames, LLC also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the 				site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). FreshGames, LLC and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set 					identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.
Please note that FreshGames, LLC’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes. While FreshGames, LLC requires that companies comply with 						FreshGames, LLC’s privacy policy before FreshGames, LLC allows those companies to access our sites and services, FreshGames, LLC does not actually control third-party data collection and use. FreshGames, LLC 				encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.
In the future, should FreshGames, LLC incorporate features for which collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 is necessary, FreshGames, LLC will:
Provide parents with notice about what information we may collect from children, how FreshGames, LLC will use that information and to whom it may be disclosed
Obtain prior consent from parents for collection, use and disclosure of data from children when applicable
Limit the collection of personal information from children to only that which is reasonably necessary for participation in a particular site or service activity
Provide information to parents about how they can request to review the information that FreshGames, LLC has collected from their child and to request that FreshGames, LLC delete such information.
