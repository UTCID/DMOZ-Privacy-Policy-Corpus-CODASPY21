TERMS OF SERVICE
1. Applicability and Acceptance of Terms of Service:
These Terms of Service (“TOS”) govern your access to and use of the California State Lottery (“the Lottery”) website at (the “Site”) and all related websites, networks, downloadable software, mobile applications (including tablet applications) and other technology services (Services) offered by the Lottery (collectively with the Site, the “Services”).
Please read these TOS carefully. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by these TOS (including the Lottery’s Privacy Policy). If you do not agree to be bound by these TOS or are not eligible to use the Services, please exit the Site immediately and refrain from using the Services.
To register for the Services, you must:
Be eighteen (18) years of age or older.
Provide your name, date of birth, email address and California home address or P.O. box.
The Lottery takes steps to verify the information that you submit when registering for the Services. If sufficiently verified, your registered player account will provide access to all of the Services. If your information appears to qualify you for an account but cannot be sufficiently verified, your registered player account will not allow you to participate in some of the Services, including the Lottery’s Jackpot Captain and 2nd Chance programs.
Only one registered player account is permitted per person. If it is determined that a person has multiple accounts, the Lottery may terminate some or all of those accounts, at its sole discretion. In addition, players with multiple active accounts may be disqualified from receiving 2nd Chance prizes, at the Lottery’s sole discretion.
2. Revisions to Terms of Service:
The Lottery reserves the right, at its discretion, to change these TOS at any time. Please check these TOS periodically for changes. In the event that a change to these TOS materially modifies your rights or obligations, the Lottery will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such change. The Lottery may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Services, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an account or through other mechanisms.
3. Description of the Services
The Services provide users with various forms of entertainment and ways to win prizes big and small.

You will have the option to “opt out” of some, but not all, of these communications.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that enhance the Services, including the release of new Lottery websites, networks, software, mobile applications and other technology services, shall be subject to these TOS.
You are solely responsible for obtaining access to the Services, and you understand that access may involve third-party fees (such as internet service provider or airtime charges).
