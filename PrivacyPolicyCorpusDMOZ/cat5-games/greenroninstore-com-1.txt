Return Policy
We'll replace defective product or product damaged in shipping, except for items in the Scratch & Dent store, which are purchased as-is. Items ordered in error can be exchanged for store credit.
PDFs cannot be returned.
Note: If you take advantage of our Pre-Order Plus deal, pre-order the physical book, add on the PDF for just $5, and then cancel the physical pre-order, we will refund you the price of the pre-order minus the difference between the full PDF price and the $5 you paid.
