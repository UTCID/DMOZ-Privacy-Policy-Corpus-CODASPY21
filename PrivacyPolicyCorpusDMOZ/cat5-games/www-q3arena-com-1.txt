Video Warrior Network Communications Privacy Policy
The Video Warrior Gaming Network, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of
Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.
Consumer Information
During the process of delivering an ad to you, the Video Warrior Network does not collect any personally identifiable
information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Video Warrior does obtain some types of
non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser
type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by Video
Warrior is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.
The following types of information can be collected:
Your domain: e.g., .com, .net, or .edu. This is standard information that is available with
all communication sent on the Internet.
Other information that Video Warrior can infer consists of:
Operating system: e.g., Windows, DOS, Macintosh, or UNIX;
Browser version and type: e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer;
Browser language: e.g., Java or Unix;
Internet Service Provider (ISP): e.g., MindSpring or AOL;
Clickstream information: Video Warrior can infer how you use the sites and pages on the internet, and can infer your local
time.
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out
a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Video Warrior may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser.
This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Video Warrior may combine this information
with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific
type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.
Data Collection
The Video Warrior Network, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. Video
Warrior cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a
unique number that is provided to you the first time Video Warrior serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a
cookie file on your computer, helps Video Warrior target ads to you. This cookie can help Video Warrior ensure that we don't
serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings
so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe
that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant
content to you, they are not required for Video Warrior to deliver you an ad.
If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your
web browser's Help documentation for more information.
